Conversation with 
Hi
How bitchy would it be to reply pretending to be my mom hahahah. "I know what you just did with my son, please don't ever text this number again."
Lol don't do that
Are you going to watch project x without me??
Niet
Then what are you going to watch? I also want to watch a movie when I finish my homework. Or I could exercise.
Maybe one day we can have the same movie and watch it at the same time and Skype while we watch
I'm going to watch the normal heart
Maybe shortbus
Do all of that!
That would be so cute! We definitely need to do that over winter break.
What's the normal heart?
I think I will :)
Or sooner lol?
It is a movie based on a play by Larry Kramer. He is basically you but 65 years older
He wrote a book called faggots in 1978, pissed a lot of people off. The famous quote is And every faggot couple I know is deep into friendship and deep into fucking with everyone else but each other and any minute any bump appears in their commitment to infinitesimally obstruct their view, out they zip like petulant kids to suck someone else’s lollipop instead of trying to work things out, instead of trying not to hide, and…unh…why do faggots have to fuck so fucking much?!" Mostly the last line
Holy shit," somebody muttered in the dark.
"A virgin," sputtered another.
"I didn't know they still made them."
Of the 2,639,857 faggots in the New York city area, 2,639,857 think primarily with their cocks.
You didn't know that the cock was a thinking organ?
Well, by this time, you should know that it is.
Brilliant guy. Very angry all the time
Actually, I'm so glad you mentioned him because he is exactly the type of person I need to reference in my language research paper thank you so much!!!
Angry with the lgbt community's obsession with sex and lack of real relationships?
Also what do you mean exactly like me lol?
What is the topic? 
Yes but a lot more than that. It was a time when people didn't come out, and he was one of the very "everyone needs to come out, now!" people. Also one of the first responders to HIV. He was behind all of the major activist groups. Here is a very influential article he wrote: 
Idk he just reminds of you sometimes
The transforming public opinion towards the LGBT community from 1970-now with an emphasis on left organizations/groups.
You know what my grandpa and mom say? AIDS is on the earth as a punishment for the gays.
Sergio I'm a gold mine
I know everything
About that topic
Literally
The one real book I have read in 5 years is on that
What is the book?
Maybe you can read over my essay sometime, or perhaps even help me adjust my outline so I include more important ideas and exclude unnecessary ones.
And the Band Played on. Also the film How to Survive a Plague (on Netflix)
Send it 
When you finish
Well finished my outline last night but I don't know when we are starting the actual writing. She will probably hand back outlines tomorrow since she's a fast grader.
I thought you never finished that book lol?
No I didn't but I got 250 pages in sooo I got a lot of it
Oh ok!
Do you find gay rights history more important than other historical affairs because it somewhat pertains to you?
No I just find it interesting. I don't think it's very important. But also since I'm so interested in HIV, I got a lot of gay history as a side salad when researching 
Not for a paper just for myself
Today Annika said I was looking especially hot. It was funny
Fuck you
?
That bath picture was wow
I can't believe I missed out on that
It was a really nice picture
Would feel weird to screenshot it
You could have screenshotted I would not mind!
Are you so interested in HIV bc you want to be a doctor?
Yeah, Annika was right hahah ;)
I am so horny Sergio 
Is it weird to ask for another
I want to be a doctor because I am interested in HIV
In a bit ;)
It was great in the car, I didn't understand why you ask if I'm "just saying that"
*asked
Well, you said last time that I had gotten a lot better, but you never complained before ya know
But oh I wanted to fuck you so badly 
I thought it was especially nice because I was telling you what to do and incorporating your head more this time than before
Do you ever masturbate in the bath or shower
I'm glad you told me what to do, you should be more forceful with it!!
Mm literally once or twice
You know what, you're right. Like when I did that to you and you were guiding me on where to go and what was the 'spot' it was super helpful and made me feel better about myself.
Lol once or twice per bath?
No, once or twice ever
I almost never do it in there
I want to fuck you right now god why did I say no fuckkkkkkkkkkkkakakakajagsiqos
I don't know :(
Even though you thought it was gross, it's not like my head was going anywhere. Just the other head with no perception haha.
Weird, that's almost always where I do it.
You know
What does it feel like to you when it first goes in
I feel like it is such a special moment
Yes! I agree. that's why I always try to kiss you or have our lips together when I first go in. 
Also it's relieving and makes me feel victorious
:)
I am so lucky to be with you
Eh, I started watching this documentary called Cropsey about child abductions in Staten Island but I can't handle it.
Why did you pick that??
That is so specific
Hahah saw this post about the best 8 documentaries on Netflix this year so I made it a goal to watch them all 
Link
How to survive a plague 10/10
Bitch
Those were all 12
Also Jesus camp is great
Oops, I meant 12 lol. Actually 36 so yay.
I'm watching Trainspotting and what the fuckkkkk
The whole toilet scenario
The first time I tried to watch it I lost it there and quit
Only to try again
Was debating whether or not to do the same
Felt like throwing up :/
It is a pretty nasty movie. Also hard to understand the slang
You know, a lot of drug scenes in movies where people are snorting or injecting things disturb me on the deepest level
Then you would not do well with Requiem for a Dream
I just look away or take off the earphones. How can you bear to watch and hear somebody snort cocaine?!
To be honest it doesn't bother me
Injecting is another story
UGHHHHHH I RECEIVED TWO EMAILS ABOUT STAFFING AT BOY SCOUT CAMPS FOR THIS SUMMER
FUCK
NO
You can say no...???
Sergio why don't you just get your damn eagle and be done and leave
Injecting isn't too bad for me. I think that's because it's normal to receive shots (injections) but not to stick things into your nose? Idk
This week I have to call the Tucson Village Farm for an eagle project. That's halfway there.
But like if you have track marks and are injecting into a black necrotic pustule, as I have seen show
Shown
Oh my goodness
I just had to look up a picture, didn't I
See you're looking more at the effects of long term injection whereas I'm looking at the action itself
That's a good point. Though I hate watching the needle being pulled out
And the skin snaps back into place
So I am going to sleep on that delicious note
Good night
Sleep right
Tight
Yes, super delicious
Never got that bath picture but oh well haha
Next time, next time :P
Oh right, fuck
I'm sorry. I will surprise you with it 
When I'm in church
Good night and sweet dreams :)
Hi!! How was mock trial?
Good! I can't talk right now phone almost dead :(
Hi
Hey what's up
Dis dick
No actually I just got home
Wbu
Aw, dis dick hasn't been up :( 
From where?
Well... I had global which was absolutely amazing today. Ahmad had nothing to do so we invited him, okay? Originally we were going to talk about Egypt, but somehow we landed on Palestine-Israel, and he just blew our minds.
He handled the topic very maturely and professionally. 
Then I went to grandpa's and actually just woke up from a nap.
Literally 15 minutes ago
Did you have a bass lesson?
I was at a birthday party of a family friend.
Oh, how interesting. In mock trial we gossiped ridiculously because no one but aramis read the affidavits.
Did I wake you up?
No those are Tuesdays 
You did not wake me up, I woke up on my own and then proceeded to eat Greek yogurt with blueberries.
Oh my goodness, I hate reading over and writing affidavits. What is the case about?
It's a police brutality/homicide...
Ew I hate greek yog
Why the ...? Also were those the papers that your house cleaner threw away?
It's just a bit too relevant and passionate a topic that it's strange that they chose it right now
Yes but I found them they were somewhat hidden but it's ok
Mm I don't think so, but that's okay.
Well I mean for half the time we have to defend the cop, and it'a clear he's an ass it's just whether he is a murderer or not
You know what Martha's dad told me yesterday morning? First he asked how I did on the PSAT and for my percentile, and then he told me, "oh, that means you're smarter than 93% of juniors."
Ohhhh you're defending the cop.
I feel like I already told you that...
You didn't tell me
Is that wrong because SAT isn't a good measure of intellect or that it's mean or....?
I don't get it
Yes, I told him he's wrong and that I don't agree with him.
It pissed me off so much.
Why??
Because it really isn't a good measure of intellect, like you said, which is also what I believe.
I mean sure but why do you care so much
I mean why didn't you just nod and move on
Well they are so hard on Martha for her PSAT score, and if I could perhaps dispel the notion that your SAT/PSAT score determines intelligence then maybe they won't be so ignorant.
When Martha told me that her mom was binge eating  chocolate because she was upset about her score, I had no idea what to say.
Wow...
Wtf
I didn't know they were so intense
Yeah... I felt terrible. But Martha is so oblivious and is really hard on herself, even though the school she wants to go to doesn't even look at the PSAT score? She said it's for "brownie points."
Really, I think BASIS needs to sit everyone down before the PSAT and give y'all a reality check that it's useful for arizona state schools and literally nothing else (ok if you get to the end of the process it's a $1500 scholarship but literally no one at basis has ever gotten it). It is entirely unimportant and a waste of your time and to prep for it or become upset because it is wholly irrelevant if you do not want to go to a state school (which, if you are up for national merit, would already give you an almost full ride anyway probably)
Amen brother. 
It's probably because her parents grew up and attended college in Poland, and Martha didn't fully explain it to her parents.
Well my parents did in Israel and they retain critical thinking skills about these things
Oh okay. You're right. I don't think education systems in those two countries are any different. They all grow up the same, right. Thanks!
Jk, but Martha's mom was explaining to me the importance of tests in Poland.
I thought you were referring to the fact that they were foreign in general not a specific trait
And how they determine college entrance, more so than GPA does.
In one sense it's an objective measurement..
I mean it is A standard. If done correctly standardized testing can be a great tool for admission
I also agree, but specifically for specialization. A test like the PSAT measures shit. Congratulations just because you know some vocab words and remember your algebra 2 and precalculus. 
Do you think you would feel at all differently if you got 99
I mean you seemed more than content to study your vocab words and precalc prior to receiving result.
Actually, I've thought about this quite a bit. I do think I would feel differently. I think I would be happy for my automatic admission into the UA honors college, however I wouldn't flash it around in people's faces.
I was studying for the SAT not the PSAT.
Well, wait are you above 90%
And I genuinely enjoyed studying vocab words...
Yeah
you could get national Hispanic probably
Which is also auto admit
And same benefits
I know...
No it's literally equivalent
I felt terrible because Reyna got so much lower than I did
She barely got 80 and I didn't want to tell her my score but she kept asking
I don't like sharing grades or results when I do better than others
Makes me feel like a dick
Yeah it's an issue
Anyway I'm going to sleep
Good night
Lol okay
Well goodnight then.
Diviya wants me to tell you she's sorry
And that she brought it up in passing
Sergio wtf I literally didn't tell you guys
Pretty sure one of you told me, Joseph did not tell me while camping as he thought
Diviya says you were really drunk when you said it
Because I didn't hear it from him
I didn't even hear that... Like I didn't tell Jennifer anything
I really don't remember it and I feel strongly that I didn't
And I am so pissed the fuck off that now Joseph is pissed at me and I really remember thinking to myself that that was something I would never tell anyone
Diviya says that you and her were really drunk and that she just remembers hearing it
Sergio...
I really do not remember saying it and I don't know who told me it but it wasn't Joseph. Maybe someone else told both of us while drunk??
Honestly I feel like Jen told me
But I don't remember
And this is really really irritating I'm very upset 
Aimee I literally know nothing about this. I only found out about this today
I'm just typing what Diviya is telling me to say
Joseph told me you said you heard it from me
??? Heard what???
The thing Diviya brought up
Okay I literally didn't find out about anything
Diviya said that she heard what you guys did at the camping trip
When you were under the influence
That we did what???
Can I talk to Diviya?
Diviya says she doesn't remember
That's bullshit
She says forget about it she'll talk to Joseph
What did she tell Jennifer that she got so upset about
She just said that the boys were talking about how far they have gone
During the camping trip
OHHHH I thought it was something else. But still I didn't talk about that either
Jennifer just got upset that her sex life was being publicized 
Ok I did not publicize anything
Literally
Diviya says yeah
And Joseph said something about frequency? I literally know nothing about frequency
Oh I was asking about Diviya's story as a joke and Jennifer misconstrued it
Diviya says that Jennifer took this out of whack 
And that frequency was never mentioned
Ok I just don't want Joseph to be upset I really don't recall doing anything....
He was really pissed
Okay well Diviya says that Jennifer misunderstood 
Ok well Diviya needs to make that really fucking clear. 
She wants to know if she should call Jen?
I don't care 
Can she call Joseph?
Maybe she should tomorrow or later so it calms down a bit
Wait why was Joseph so mad? What did he say?
He said she was very pissed
Okay well Jennifer really misinterpreted Diviya's story
It was really stupid and nothing to get upset about.
Jennifer sent me a bitchy text
What did she say???
Hey... So thanks for saying you're not going to tell anybody else.. Diviya said you were a little drunk. 
Also, Aimee, we used to be friends. And we're still nice to each other, but I've heard some of the things you've said about me, and I don't understand why you say such mean or untrue things about me. It's just that the more and more not-nice things I hear about that you've said to or about me or my friends, It's harder for me to feel the friendliness that I used to feel about you. 
I don't really know what I'm expecting. All I know is that I try to avoid having enemies or negative presences in my life. I liked when we were friends. 
And I know this is going to sound bitchy, but please think about the things you say about other people. You say so many hurtful things about or to people and its difficult because I want to be friends, but it's hard when I know the things you've said about me to other people. 
Honestly, I don't know if this message will help anything or just make it worse, but it's just what I'm feeling. 
The only reason I started feeling unfriendly feelings toward you was once I heard all of the hurtful things said about me and about others. 
Other than that, I always liked you and thought we were friends. 
Anyways.. yeah 
Well what will you say?
This is so ridiculous
Should I even answer
No, Diviya really needs to talk to her ugh
Like Reyna and I were even there and it wasn't serious
Also you replying back isn't going to fix anything
Is Diviya mad at me??
She thinks you're mad at her because of this
But she said it's just a passing madness 
I somewhat am but it's ok
Mostly mad at the situation because its so bull
This reminds me so much of middle school.
Are you feeling okay?
Jennifer just asked if she had the right number lol
What did you answer 
Yes it's so dumb
I'm upset but it's ok...
I just said yes but that texting you or anybody won't accomplish anything and that nobody wants any problems right now.
Can I call you
Yeah in like 3 minutes?
I finished
What's up
Hey, how was it? What were you doing?
It went fine, I didn't mess up so I'm happy. It was a 30 min long musical 101 Dalmatians very cute
Lol I've seen that before
When I saw the costumes for the Dalmatians, I thought it was the most adorable thing ever,
But I'm happy for you :)
It was so adorable
What are we doing this weekend? Hanukkah or..?
Yeah, I think we should do Hanukkah... Do you want to?
Also on the 14th is the 4th avenue winter street fair
If you don't want to go to the Hanukkah thing that's cool 
No I do
But it's up to you
Yeah, of course.
Also I would feel bad not going after telling Eva and lissa yes
Sure. What time? I forgot
FUCK
I have a show tomorrow at 530
Well call is then, it ends at 730
Call is then? The party starts at 7:30.
Call is when I need to show up
Ok, can I meet you there, then?
Yeah sure, are we going to do anything after?
Prolly
I'm gonna go to sleep. I'm tired and sad so I have no excuse to stay awake. Good night! I'm excited to hang out tomorrow
Aww alright, well goodnight and feel better. See you tomorrow.
Hi
Hi, I was going to text you earlier but when I was asleep my baby brother disabled my phone for over an hour...
Hahaha
What's up
I kept watching short bus it gets so much weirder
I've been babysitting since 8. Just made breakfast for me and baby brother and I was checking up on the news.
Does the whole thing revolve around sex?
Now I'm watching The Square.
Mm somewhat? It's all very strange. They meet up at this... Sex club? I don't even know what to call it and everyone there is weird as hell
What is that about
Tahrir?
Like all of the characters meet at this club?
Yes, pretty much.
Yeah they all meet there. 
Are you going to church today
No church today! My mom went to work this morning
Lol I saw that before too!
I love that show
 too, I basically like seeing reaction videos in general.
But that video is really beautiful
Is richie w you
I cried at the last person
He's still asleep lol. He will be in his room for hours after he wakes up though.
I almost did too, also the second to last
Lol I bet he's in that 12/13 year old jerk off 15 times a day phase
Is the square worth watching
Ew I don't even want to think about that. I accidentally saw his dick sticking out of his boxers a few months ago, ehhhhhh.
I think it's more for people who aren't aware of what happened..
Or want to see the revolution from the full perspective of different revolutionists
So, not recommended if you have some awareness of what happened? More for future people?
When is your mom coming gone
Home
Yes, like I would recommend it to somebody like Martha who doesn't keep up with Middle Eastern news. The movie just observes the life of protesters under Mubarak and Morsi
Or when are you guys going to gpa
My mom is coming home at 4 so I'm probably going to grandpa's around 5/6
Oh. My parents went to Phoenix just now so I'm here until 530 alone :P
How long will they be in Phoenix?
Maybe if they're still in Phoenix we can leave Hanukkah early?
Only until around 530..
:(
They are going there to pick up an oven (???!!!???)
Hahahahahah what's wrong with the ovens in Tucson?
Idk I guess there just isn't one at a price they want idk
Why did you even need a new oven?
It's for one of the rentals
Is it free to attend 101 Dalmatians?
$5
They are making bank they pack like 200 parents in there
So only parents go?
When is lucky stiff?
Nah lots of siblings and teachers too, and friends
Lucky stiff is sometime late January idk. I delegated most of the work on it to Garrett 
Shit sorry didn't meant to send that
Lol what is that
It was from when Isabella and I were volunteering that one day.
There is a peach tree in that picture
If I went to your house where would I go at 5:30?
Who are the people? Are they people you had described?
It won't work out, my parents came back, the lady in Phoenix called idk they aren't going today
Oh, no they are not. Just people who went to volunteer.
My mom wants me to get a ride to the place, but I think it's okay.
Ok how is that going to happen? I can take you to the show and then we can go to the Hanukkah thing
No I think it'll work out. She will probably take to to basis around 7:30?
Yeah that would be fine
It will probably end around 740 
Did you finish the square
Yes I finished that around 11. I also watched the Addams family last night
Ok coo coo
I'm watching dear Zachary and it's so fucking sad
I have no idea what that is...
This guy is murdered by his psycho ex and so his friend makes a movie about him to show to the son that the ex was carrying when he died 
It's a documentary
What the fuck
But how would he know that the ex was going to murder him?
He didn't know? He made it after the guy died
He interviewed everyone the guy had known and also had a lot of footage and pictures of him growing up because they made short movies together 
Ok yeah that was a stupid question idk why I asked
I wasn't really paying attention, sorry
How did you hear about it?
Hi!
Hi
What's up
Just reading el periódico, wbu?
Also is Bradford's Christmas party ON Christmas Day?
You know, it is common in architecture/city planning to demolish or significantly remodel a building around 75 years after it was built because even for unexceptional buildings, making it past the 100 year mark tends to make the public think of it as historically significant and require maintenance and restoration which is very costly
Lol I texted you right as you texted me
No it's on like the 21st
What about banks or restaurants or stores? Do those count too? Or is it just homes and government buildings?
You should....
Have a fancy Christmas dinner. No drinking, and if anything then wine during the dinner.
And no sleeping over either.
I finished dear Zachary :( 
Mm I'm not sure. I think it's more stores and businesses. restaurants and houses would generally benefit from the history because it is all about image whereas businesses just need the space to work and sell things
Mm no thanks
I really don't want to have one
If it's no alcohol and no sleepover anyone could have it
Why wouldn't you want to have it?
Also, do you know any really good news podcasts?! I was searching the Internet all night for one, but to little avail.
Holding things like that is just stressful. 
Lol no I don't get the concept of podcasts, they seem to me to be a format for amateurish media. Why do you want a podcast
I specifically said no sleepover and no alcohol so that it would not be stressful? I don't understand? I just meant like we all bring food and then eat, talk, and leave.
From 6:30-9 or something
Well, I wanted to fall asleep listening to the news since I was already falling asleep reading it, so...
Cos who would even come. Many are out of town, anyway. I think it would be you me Martha Diviya and reyna if there was no partying involved 
Lol
NPR I guess
I would also really want Jay to come. Maybe it could be a MUN thing and invite Hannah and Carly too. Idk, whatever. 
Nvm bad idea I guess
It's not a bad idea I just am not in the mood really
I tried NPR but at 11:45 they were just playing Christmas music lol.
Alright then, it's cool
What are your plans today
Mm nothing really, just work on homework?
Wbu
Nothing really
Probably watch a movie that's it
I'll probably watch two movies today. 
1. Love the Hard Way, which Zayna says sucks but the guy Adrien Brody is super attractive. He's in The Pianist.
2. Last 30 minutes of Trainspotting 
I guess 2 doesn't really count
What is the first one about
"It is about the story of a petty thief who meets an innocent young woman and brings her into his world of crime while she teaches him the lessons of enjoying life and being loved."
Sounds cute?
Mm sounds strange and exploitive lol maybe it's done right
You know what's so funny
We both do things that we don't want each other to know about
?
Yeah, you know?
Like everybody in relationships does it
There are just things we don't tell each other
I'm not saying with other people, though.
I mean I guess so
It's just a strange thing to randomly say
Idk I've just been thinking about it
wait, are your parents going to Phoenix today?
If you're not gonna do anything we should go Xmas shopping and split the cost
No idk when they are going
Well I'm only shopping for
Martha so... It would be a very short trip lol. 
Then I guess you can help me pick out gifts for other people to make the trip longer :)
And that 4th Ave festival is today if you're up for that. 
It's just that I'm alone w grandpa all day so I'm not going to do anything
If you don't want to it's ok though
I mean I do but I have some work and I'm tired too, but can I give you a final answer in like an hour
Where is your mom today
Oh it's okay then, don't worry
Her and brothers went home. I stayed to finish work.
I don't understand how the wives don't see money missing without the husband bringing any back...
The fee is only $0.50
And many don't take prostitutea 
Not bringing any back though... Idk 
I think many of them don't use the work excuse, or aren't married
No I watched the video and the guys said they tell their wives it's a business trip
I did too
But that was select guys, and some were widowed
It's not like they interviewed all of them
Anyway, I need to make a senior page today
But I don't have any pics so I'm just gonna do something trashy. Ideas?
Just put a quote and a pretty nature pic
That was the plan
Maybe a rap quote?
Maybe Tupac
Hahah
I realized why the club was called short bus. The short school bus is for the "special" kids. They are the special kids
You still use tumblr for non porn reasons??
"The characters all converge on a weekly underground gathering or salon called Shortbus, inspired by the short yellow school buses for "challenged" students."
Yeah I had read about it a few days ago
Goddammit
At least I was correct
I figured it out by myself #thankssweeney
Oh those are all porn gifs
I did not know
Well I haven't seen the movie, gosh
Lol I was just proud of me
Yes. And I do use tumblr for non porn purposes. Mostly just for fashion, politics, and humor.
Do you run into much of the SJW stuff
Yeah and it alters my views a bit... So I try to avoid it. I've started following more middle eastern blogs though
As if that doesn't alter your views lol
What do you mean the SJWs alter your views, though?
Ok bitch, at least it's making me more aware.
Well you know how the SJWs find a way to criticize EVERYTHING. Literally everything. So sometimes I'll say to myself, "wow yeah never noticed that before.." over a really stupid undeveloped argument some SJW makes
Well, it's an incredibly biased userbase, so unless you have a carefully curated list of followed blogs.. Not that I care I'm just saying. 
Yes!! There was this recent song that was meant to be pro-LGBT and they just tore it apart. So dumb
True. Idk I just think it's so interesting to see blogs of average Lebanese/Syrian/Egyptian teenagers. On the news we see one side of everything but these are kids who are still in school and live an average life with an average family.
Hahahah they tear apart everything. Sometimes even each other.
You know, it's crazy to think that the average person in Mexico earns less than 2/3 of the minimum wage level here
$8000
But things are less expensive in Mexico unless you're buying electronics. Food is soooo cheap
And everybody gets their braces in Mexico
Sure but not 5x cheaper. The standard of living is certainty a lot lower. Like for the xican kids in AZMUN it still costs about $1000 which is a lot for an average xican. But they are also all from elite private schools 
This aftershave smells like you
Those kids from Mexico were really well off... I befriended two of them and I got to see Itzel's (one of the girls) quince pics which was super expensive. She also travels all over South America and the south of our America.
Really? So it smells like laundry 😛
Lol somewhat
It is like Gillette laundry
Do you wear Gillette!??
Not gonna lie that sounds like a dream. I wonder how many of the parents are wealthy through legitimate means. My impression was that many of the wealthy are either related to governmental corruption, monopolies, or cartels
The ones I spoke to were very nationalistic and desired to reform the country
Many wanted to be cops or politicians 
They did not want to leave Mexico at all
Nope, I switch off between Old Spice and Degree.
Many government officials work in tandem with the cartel too...
It's so corrupt
Yeah all the ones I spoke to said that they want to go to college in Mexico and then continue working in Mexico
You know it's gross when chicks wear right dresses and they cling to the beer belly
Diviya 24/7, please don't repeat
I mean she doesn't have a beer belly though
But a lot of her bodycon garments aren't flattering
I'm gonna shout it to the skies
I think she got unlucky in fat distribution.
It's all hip and below
Martha weighs more than me
Eh more like waist and below
She gets it in all the right places tho 
Unlike me :(
Jk lol. But yeah I agree.
Were both of your parents thin teenagers?
Lol you don't even have body fat
My mom, yes, she was somewhat anorexic. My dad, yeah, built somewhat like you
Ummm yes I do? You don't look at anything on my body besides my dick
Strange, that's like my parents but opposite.
No!
Like you don't have arm fat, the only place you maybe have a little is chest. Literally that's it
I pay attention bitch
Your dad was anorexic?
Haha I was joking about the dick thing
Well he was always really bony. He only started gaining weight in his late 30s.
But my mom used to run so her legs look SOOO good 
Idk why you think she's fat
Well, really, it's because I'm repulsed by her (mostly her views) and that manifests in finding her sight unattractive too
That's exactly how it is with Demi
My mom's nickname was chichona because she had bigger boobs than her sister
Legs snap
Let's
Lol wtf where did she high school
wtf we both sent dick drawings at the same time
Lol it was obv the next step
Anyway I think I'm gonna start homework soon
At 7:30. Just have to study
Did you finish your senior page?
I gave up on it because it required a wide cover photo and it was just dumb so I emailed them and said I didn't want one. I'm not sentimental anyway
Oh okay
That's kinda a shame but if it works for you then oh well
Literally could not make out anything in that snap
I know my light here is so bad I'm sorry
It's fine
I can't leave my room bc my parents have friends over
What do you have to study for
I'm almost done masturbating anyway
Bio and APUSH 
 too
But you don't even take long
I have been doing this for minutes and minutes 
 too..
What are you thinking about
Ummm when I had my hand on you after we finished 
And then you put your hand on mine and moved it
That's what I'm thinking about
Did you want to go again after that?
You said no lol so
I don't know why I did I wanted to in retrospect
Our sexy snap thing failed so much 
I'm sorry
I wish it didn't
It was kinda frustrating me
Wtf how am I still going
Been like 15 min
Lol me too it was so silly
I finally finished
Just now
Wtf same
Like just now
I just feel like consistency is key for something like that
You need maybe 10 spare minutes or so
That wasn't good for me :/
Literally such a waste of time. Fuck I'm so stupid
What?
What are you even talking about
Ok I thought we were gonna end up 'snapping' you know, and I would be done
That was like 6:12
I have wasted all this time just to come and it wasn't even that good
Sorry, my fault, I got distracted
Well, that's just how life is... 
Ok
I'm just so upset
Why???
You are gonna get your work done anyway
And you waste a ton of time doing all kinds of things why so upset with this
-phone about to die and family friend took charger, I may not answer-
No I just wanted it to be a good orgasm
Who else do you think about when you masturbate?
Always wanted to ask
Oh ok
Probably Jacob and Shawn and Henry
No I don't think of people
I think of actions
Or porn. I hit the random button on pornmd and just pick the most appealing of the first 10 videos
Usually I think of memories though
Times we did things
Moments
That's weird. I can imagine anybody I want doing whatever I want
So I usually think about people
I could too it just doesn't turn me on really
I don't fantasize about things far from what I have already done
Okay well anyway
I'm going to go study and your phone is going to die or whatever. I'm sorry about all that
I just feel really shitty and tired
Ok :;
:(
You should listen to Sylvester
He makes me happy
I need you
Disco heat
You make me feel
Ok, thanks. Maybe tonight
I'll listen to it now!
He's... Black
What did you expect lol
His back up singers later became the weather girls (it's raining men)
Whaaaat! Well that's a fun little fact
Idk he sounded European
I'm so mad because my mom decided to come back to grandpa's right now.
And then my mom asked if I was mad that she is here and I said yes then she got upset with me
And said if it's not nice then why say it
Lol why did she ask. 
And why are you upset
I guess he does. It's a unique sound
I mean to say why do you care if she is there
This is so great, makes me feel like im in Xanadu 
She asked because I was being curt
Can't study and their presence bothers me
I know, that song is definitely the best a real disco classic
Why can't you study? Is it the brothers or her
Mostly the brother, but she sits at the same table I do and I like to work alone
You should tell me a bunch of artists to listen to
Horse at Disco? What a peculiar name for an album haha
Is that an album name of his? Pretty self deprecating. Ok I'll do that soon, I'm going to sleep. Hope you can study
Gut nacht
Hahah okay, goodnight b sweet dreams
Hi
Hey how are you? How was your day?
I'm alright, my day was pretty damn good 
 and sienna watched pulp fiction and actually got work done on history paper. What about you
Oh that's good. Bio midterm went well. Was just a really relaxed and easy day for me. Have lots of work tonight though.
APUSH and..?
- Bio midterm part 2 tomorrow
- physics problems
- Chinese passage reading
- SEMINAR ESSAY
Math?
Just finished it like 5 minutes ago
Great
I am watching the grand Budapest hotel and it is weird but I like
What's it about?
a fancy concierge is framed for a murder because he is an heir to a fortune. It has so many strange elements. Like all the actors use their normal accents, some are American, others British which has no bearing on where their characters are supposed to be from and sometimes speak poetically, other times like the 30's (it's set in the 30's) and other times completely modern.
Oh that voice things is strange. All I know about the movie is that Saoirse Ronan is in it, and I really like her.
She had a facial birthmark shaped exactly like Mexico
These are the kinds of strange details Wes Anderson includes
That's so strange hahah. Do they ever explain it or address it?
They acknowledge it once but that's it
What are you working on now
What are some other strange details?
Finishing this stupid apush packet. I think I'm going to go to school at 10 or something tomorrow bc I have lots
All the women that visit the hotel are blonde.
Why don't you just not until bio? When do you have bio?
It's a more prevalent thing in the royal Tenenbaums but there are random things here too
Hi?
Hi
Are you okay)
Yeah I just had to get some national merit stuff done urgently
Oh ok, how was MUN?
Did you talk to Joseph?
No see I ditched MUN to do it
Ohhhhh, yeah so many people did. Keizer, Martha, Jen, Diviya, me
Then why did you ask if I was okay??
I was just checking on you....?? Ok nvm
????
What??? No, i was just texting you to see how you were
Like how we text every day...
Nvm ok
Lol if you feel like telling me what is was later I'd appreciate
What did you do instead of MUN
Sorry yeah, I was just with Diviya and Madeleine and Martha
Diviya was trying to read our texts 
It was just an awk situation but I'm alone now
You're so good at knowing what's up hahah
Lol you are damn obvious
Why did she want to read them
Well I wanted to talk about something innocent idk
Why??
Ok
I have bass lesson must go
Oh ok have fun!
But she was just trying to see what we were talking about? Idk. She was acting super out of it
We went to La Paloma to see the winter formal room and talk about the pricing, food, photo booth, etc. Then Madeleine took Keizer and me home. We had fun in the car though.
Cool! What did you guys do
So I'm in your area and I have to burn 30 min...
If you are busy it cool
Oh cool yeah!
Hold on i'll be home soon
Yeah??
Ok when
Yeah we can leave at 7 and go to library?
I really don't have much hw now that bio is over
Oh wait only 30 min?
Yeah..
So then do you still want to or no? Since we only have like 15 min
What are you even doing?
I'm ok until 715
Or 720
Will explain
Mmmm ok so then once we're done can you take me to library?
Ok
Or back home?
I'll be there in like 5
Ok
Basically I had bass lesson early, family friend not home yet
Oh ok
Here
Hi
Unfortunately there is no middle finger emoji...
Jk haha. Hi. Hope you got there on time.
Sorry for being an ass :)
I did
What do you have left to study/do
It's quite alright, halfway done with math! 
Umm I have:
Apush, Lang, math
Wbu?
I'm leaving now to go home
That still sounds like a lot
Not really, almost done with apush. That's pretty much all I have.
Lol I'm still here
But mom is getting me at 9
finished everything!!
I can't believe it. Sex and homework all done by 9. It must be a miracle.
Are you fucking kidding me. There's a ferguson protest tonight in Tucson and they're blocking roads and shit
Listen to club tropicana by wham
I know right a miracle 
Wtf where
I forget, but they also said that the protests shut down the streetcar a few weeks ago
???
Fucking blind ass liberals
I don't even get it
I mean yeah sure, protest on the sidewalk and whatever, but to go out of your way to ruin means of transportation and harass innocent people is just so wrong
Religious fanatics don't even create that much of a big deal
Also I've heard this song! I really like it :) I think you showed me it
What's that website to tell you if a movie is on foreign Netflix?
Plus I'm sure it makes a big impact right? Wrong
Also "everything she wants"
Moreflicks.com
Wow Aimee, look at what they're doing. It's so.. Poignant... So.... Moving.. It's so beautiful how hundreds of white people can lie down on the street...
Those legislators are going to remember this next time they're making those laws 
#slacktivism
Fuck them
I hear UC Berkeley and UDub are all about protests
Protests are so dumb
Except like you know when it is something that can really affect change
And needs local media attention
Like a rare tree that will be torn down or something
Or like ACT UP!
You should read about them they were insane with the protests
And theirs were no bitch protests
They were for sure most successful protest group since racial civil rights 
This is exactly what I agree with (red ribbon = HIV awareness)
Yeah in my essay I'm talking about ACT UP! and I just don't understand why we don't see protests like that anymore. Protests about something that could actually be fixed by implementing policies, rather than actions done by racists that can't be changed unless you raise the new generation 'correctly'
Well there aren't any issues that significant
Is protesting on the street going to bring back Mike Brown? No. 
Was not indicting the police officer for killing him wrong? Sure, depends who you ask.
But there's nothing we can do about it
We just have to educate people, it's not the govts job
People cared and devoted time because they and many of the people they knew had an expiration date
And many were kicked out of jobs or too weak, so they had time
Are millions going to die from police brutality? I think not..
Well it's more protesting the political and racial climate- but that isn't something worth protesting. You can't change that with protest really at all
I just couldn't agree more. Maybe as bigger issues like AIDS were starting to receive funding, people just move onto the next smaller issue to tackle
Who knows
I'm going to watch that movie Reyna recommended, submarine.
Yes we will never be at peace there will always be people angry with whatever
Tell me how it is
It's so strange how some people devote their lives to these protests or causes because they're never happy with anything. Like instead of living and focusing on your life and making the most of your life, you're 30some years old lying down on the street. I just can't believe that these are real people doing this.
Are we just never happy with anything? Why even live then if everything is so fucked up?
Well, in the same way that some issues are close to our hearts, I'm sure there are some people who are truly devoted to their cause for whatever personal reason. That's certainly a minority though
Well, there are 7 billion people with 50 billion problems
This is one of the dumber ones surely...
But if this was a gay discrimination thing where gays were killed by police I don't think we would feel quite as distanced and uninterested
Not only is it a minority, but that minority's probably consists of minorities.
Yeah
*minority
Lgbtqqawtfbbqidfk
Idek*
Too many minorities in one sentence lol
How ironic
What is your plan for tonight
Do not have.. Might watch a movie, might go to sleep, might take a long bath instead of shower 
Wbu
Well I'm going to watch that movie now, but it seems like one of those teen angst movies. It begins with him saying how we all think we are individuals and blah blah blah I'm a teenager I'm unique
Uhhahaiaoagahfuckkkk
I hate those
I hate them
Perks was cute but the teen angst pissed me off
"I find that the only way to get through life is to picture myself in an entirely disconnected reality" wowww much poetic
I liked it but the individual dumb shit and the protagonist ughhhh
AHAHAHHAHAHA
Yeah I can't do this
I saw She's the Man and that was dumb but ridiculous
Amanda Bynes?!!!?
Yes
YESSS I LOVE THAT MOVIE I OWN IT
And Channing tatum and he was actually pretty cute
Lol really 
I liked it
haha that was my fave comedy back in the day
And everybody was so surprised when she showed the goodies on the field
I KKOW!!
Know
And he thought she was gay hahahah
Just saying if she was like that at basis or something everyone would figure it out so fast she didn't even really look like a guy
Lol yes
All the soccer boys :):):)
Or it could be a Keizer type of situation. You know with the high voice and smooth complexion
True
But he is somehow still masculine enough
Nah, I don't agree. He's way too sensitive and too dependent on the girls.
he's only somewhat masculine because we know he actually is a male
I meant in appearance
Oh yeah. You know he has to shave haha.
Well we all are sensitive he is just external about it
Like you too lol
He does???
Yeah! He has more hair than you
No way
No way
He's like a gorilla
????
On his face??
All over haha
But including his face
I never thought.
I wonder if he will change in college
Or like get a gf
Or like something
I mean he can be sensitive and girly and straight
Though when girls say they like sensitive guys they don't mean how he is lol
Sensitive guys - listen to their problems and nod your head and reply every once in a while lol
Sometimes get a little deep
Basically you
Or just like don't spend 100% of time thinking with dick
Lol
Think with the other head maybe 3% of the time
Maybe I'll dress more masc in college. Just like normal blue not skinny jeans and sneakers
Lol
Inversely proportional to mass
I can't wait for college I'm going full gay
Unleash the rainbow
Oh god please no
Pls
Seen
Serj*
Don't do this to me
Lol what
Why no
What is it doing to you
U r joking, no?
Wait you must be
You just bitched today about how you dislike the sass of Sara now
And see how you were annoying 
Lol of course I'm joking. I think I'll just stay the way I am.
But I want to have really good guy friends... :(
I want to be able to hang out with the boys in their dorm or hang out one on one with a boy for lunch
You know
If you go somewhere on the east or just more liberal
I thought it was liberal here but no. They don't hate but they do judge and treat you different
The guys there don't give a fuck
Yeah, I knew that just from hearing how the boys were bothered by how much leg I was showing 
Well ok 
That's kinda different
Ok what about boys who are repulsed by anal
Or 'gay sex'
Which encompasses all male to male action
But no lesbian?
I was about to say that's a gray zone bc you can't ask them to not be turned way off by gay action but on the other hand we witness so much straight action everywhere and it doesn't get to us
Exactly, also some straight couples are into anal unless it's two boys then oh shit it's an abomination
My uncle told me that he would have anal with ugly girls so he didn't have to see their face
Just thought I would share
Has he not heard 
Of doggy style??
In Judaism it's all equally not ok :)
Goodnight b my eyes are falling
Haha I'm sure he's heard of foggy style
*doggy omg
Guess who's going to hell!
Okay good night :)
Us
:)
Let us get lunch?
No math counts so I will come by at 340
Oh ok!
I'm up here
Come down? It's a mess here
I'm in the back lot
Hi boo
Hyello
Which sounds better? 
Why zucchini
It is not traditional
Usually potato and onion
Actually, you're right. And it requires less ingredients. Thank you!
Did you light the candles yet?
Great! Yeah we did
What's up!
Is it something short? Also how does dreidel work? Are there prizes?
Haha I'm finishing math homework. It's all I have! Then I'm going to make some latkes and cucumber dill dip. Wbu?
Yes it is only 5 minutes or less. There are a couple ways to play, we usually just see whose can spin for the longest. Otherwise, the letters on each facet represent a game condition ( win 1, win 2, nothing, lose 1/2 of total) . You win chocolate coins
I'm watching risky business
We NEED to watch moonrise soon
Do you ever win haha? Also what letters are on the dreidel?
I know! We should watch it over break
Today is the first day I've ever cried from an onion
I'm so sorry :(. Is the onion ok?
Yes I won yesterday
The letters are נגהש outside of isreal and נגהפ in Israel because the former stands for great miracle happened there and the latter stands for a great miracle happened here
We should
Yes the onion is fine! I'm going to make you some latkes too :)
What is the great miracle that happened here
... Hannukah is... You know the candles and shit
:):):) I hope they turn out great
Do you have movie suggestions for me
My list, 3 watch, is 8 short 
Of full
Because my lists are 27 long
Always
Fight club?
Have you seen it?
Sorry if I don't reply, im cooking :(
Nope!
I meant personal recommendations!
Like ones you like
Preferably not educational or documentary..
Oh okay! Can I tell you in half an hour?
Ok!
Also, there is a boy at basis that looks just like Ellar Coltrane (boy from boyhood)
Somebody besides Nico (white one)? Who is it?
Have you seen Bachelorette? I liked that movie.
Aimee look, I'm like Judaism now.
And if you save some for me I too can be jew. How are they?
Ok I added to list
Idk his name sorry
Darker skin, but honey hair
They're pretty okay, not as good as the party ones though
I like how you told me no documentaries lol
My mom makes the best like goddamn
Lol I know you
Gotta be targeted or you will give me some weird Syrian bird shot
Shit*
Hahahah okay maybe Lebanese because that's my new obsession
These latkes are so shitty
:(
What went wrong
Lol when you said pretty ok it was clearly code for shit
The party latkes were not even good
Sorry- Lebanese male models who sing with babies
I thought the party ones were good because they are the only ones I've ever had
You probably saw the pic and judged me so hard
"Don't worry" in baby voice was so funny haha
Eh the pic is blurry but looks fine
Lol what?
Yeah from that baby Arabic song
Oh, yes!
So
Goodnight Country bumpkin (get it cos you are a fag)
Hahahahahah
Fuck you :)
Goodnight habibi. now I will go watch a movie because I'm all done with my cooking yayyy 
Because I had never told you some of my favorite movies: Out in the Dark, West Side Story, Kill Bill Vol. 1
Also I like Fatal Attraction and Beauty and the Beast
Thanks!!
All now on my list
How is your evening?
:)
Really great! Finished Pulp Fiction so I'm starting Love the Hard Way, and I'm at chipotle right now. And yours?
Good! Had a great conversation with family friend. He cool.
How did you like pulp fiction??
And how is the other movie
You guys are bougie bitches
Pulp fiction was so good. I thought it was cool how the movie was only over the span of two days and was segmented into the chapters.
Well I'm only like 5 minutes in haha
Because we like chipotle?
Actually it's just me who likes it. Mom doesn't as much.
Well because you guys eat out a lot
Mostly
I wish we had analyzed Pulp Fiction in cinema last year or in some English class
It's damn cool
Not too much lately since we've been with grandpa, but yeah.
I thought it was crazy when he accidentally shot that black guy in the backseat... Just the way they reacted to it and like how the dirty car was more important than some person's life
I'm more into analyzing motives of the characters rather than the cinematography.
Hi I took a nap
Sorry
I am up now!!
All of it as a whole! You see how it interconnects. Fascinating
So turns out I am giving gifts tomorrow... Already have Zayna, Madeleine, Diviya, and Martha's ready
My mom got super excited and was helping me pick things out for people. She also got me candy canes and wants me to make cookies
And she knows you're Jewish so she gave me this Passover thing lol idek what it is
Lol! Wait on giving mine lets exchange later.
It's very thoughtful of you
I was not planning on giving you yours tomorrow haha
I wanted to give it to you in private
Ok actually I'm just gonna go sleep I thought I could power nap but no
Ok great
Guten tag
Good night! :) maybe see you tomorrow?
Never!
Jk, probably
Hahaha alright well
Hi
I left bc I had to go to bathroom urgently... Lol
Omg I was looking for you all over the place, I felt like such an idiot
But I found sienna and she told me you left
I have a present for you from Martha.
I'm sorry
Aww Madeleine sent a card to my house
??
What is it??
Oh sorry, I thought it sent
Palestinian necklace
.......
Who is that from
And are you going to wear it
That is disgusting
Btw those are two different letters lol. Madeleine did not send that.
It's from Sara.
Isn't wearing something like that to school a bit politically charged?
Lol see that's what I thought at first
Yes absolutely. You would wear it elsewhere?
Quite frankly, I would be scared to wear it anywhere because of how sensitive the topic is to people
And I told her that, but she said if I wear it on 4th Ave then people will give me high fives 
But you agree with it enough to consider wearing it if not for controversy?
Nico tried to talk to me today but couldn't get out any words it was funny
Aimee what kind of question is that lol
He tried talking to you? You don't even have a class together though?
He wanted some pics with me
I was looking for something in the MPR and he was standing there
Well what do you mean he tried talking to you? Did he actually say anything
He like smiled and then he was like hey and I was like hey and he looked like he was gonna say something so I waited and then he didn't
He had asked me yesterday if I was still w you
Did you take pics w him
Well yeah I wasn't going to say no. That's really rude. 
We also took a group selfie with Connolly
Cool!
What did you do all day
Cool? Mmmm no. It was weird. 
Played cards and then cards against humanity-ish w/ Nathaniel and joann. Finished Gattaca. Played Rock Band w/ Aaron, Hayden, Hannah, and Geneva. We sang and danced to rock songs, it was fun. Ate lots of food and opened presents.
Then in language we just took pics and edited pics
Wbu?
His mouth was full with my candy cane
It must be pretty small since it all fits in his mouth
That's sounds like a good last day
I watched pulp fiction w sienna and saw the band concert
He was on the last bit of it
Did you guys finish the movie??
Also I had fun bc I spoke Spanish almost all day since my friends were in Zeitler's class
Mmmmmmmhmmm
No we had maybe 40
Min left
She is so fucking nice 
Love the dra
Mmmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
What are you doing today?
Nothing at all, currently watching boogie nights. Wbu 
Never even heard of that. 
I'm watching The Craft and then going to some ITE party with Isabella. Pay day today
It's about 70's porn industry
The craft?
Hey, Sophia asked if I wanted to hang out tonight (don't worry, at all) is that ok?
My aftershave smells like you :)
The Craft is some teen witch bitch movie from the 90s.
Yeah, idk why you had to ask for permission
Not permission, but I'm ambivalent and if you were uncomfortable w it I would say no
No it's fine. Even if I was uncomfortable, which I'm not, I don't have any right to restrain you from having fun and going out.
What is the ITE party??
Well we could invite friends and family to this party we were having for the internship I finished up.
What time
Why..?
Because I want to go if possible
It starts at 5:30 but idk when it ends.
Unless you do not want that
Aimee it's okay, you can go out and have fun.
I'm not upset I swear
No, no Sergio listen
I'm meeting up with her on 4th for food
It would be fun to go hang out with you guys until dinner time, no?
I'm not changing what I'm doing for you
Unless you don't want me to come, which is fine
I only RSVP'd for one person, I'm sorry. I didn't think it was something you'd want to go to.
Ok 
I'm sorry
It's fine 
Where are you going to eat?
Caruso's
No jk cafe passé
Oh ok, sounds cool.
Btw
The ecoprograms that ITE do look really cool. Do you actually have to do all the prerequisites they list on the site to do the more advanced ones if you are in the top age bracket? 
Well they make exceptions for people who have been involved with them in the past and give them priority. But for prerequisites you could always lie, idk. Haven't participated in any ecoprograms yet.
Well they are like, do 2 of the level 1 programs to do level 2, etc. for 6 levels..
Oh well then I'm sure you should do the level 1 programs first and stuff. I'm going to start some up after break.
Ok well good night
No, hi
I'm still out
I will talk to you in a bit
You up?
Yes
How was your thing?
Good how was yours
Fine, a couple interesting things
1. Bella Ruhl texting me confessing her love and it was all very strange
2. Sophia is genderqueer
Anything interesting at ITE?
Not really. Talked to people, ate tamales, gave my presentation, got paid.
I don't even know what that means
I honestly don't either
I didn't want to be mean or anything but I don't really understand
How much did you get paid?
250
Are you upset w me you are being curt? Sorry if misinterpretation :(
Well no, but I just don't know what to say. 
I've been playing this stupid game with jay, Nathaniel, Diviya, and Martha all night. And I finished The Craft, half of The Blue Lagoon, and right now I'm watching Sin City
Happy?
Jk, the happy was a joke.
What do you mean "confessed her love"?
"I've loved you since the start, since we taped out that set and you were so enthusiastic about the rain"
What game are you playing?
Evil Apples, like cards against humanity 
What did you say
I said "I had no idea. Sorry."
Oh 
Like an app?
That's really sad... Did she reply to that?
Yes, an app
We've stopped playing though and have been chatting
Jay is going to Mexico tomorrow
His first time
Yeah the rest of it was really sad too. It was just all sad. 
Lol I bet he will find a way to get fucked up. I hope he has a good time. Mexico can be very cool
Do you want to meet up sometime this weekend
I just can't believe you replied like that. I would be pissed off.
Well there was more to what she said
He's going with family...
Taylor was in church camp, didnt stop him.
It was like 4x longer. It was overwhelming. There was no way to react
Sure
Oh well. Also it turns out I'm going to the party tomorrow.
But jen and Zayna and Bella are going and jen is sleeping over
Idk about Zayna and Bella, I didn't ask
Ok, lets talk about it tomorrow maybe? I don't think I will go though I don't really care either way I guess. 
I'm going to go to sleep and I hope you sleep well, prince
Okay
We'll talk about it tomorrow then, but it would be sad if you don't go
You should really watch Sin City but I don't think you could handle it
Anyway goodnight
???
I couldn't handle it??
too gory
Lol watch battle royale and tell me I can't do gory
Alright, night
Good morning, 
Have you seen Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet?
Also would you like to come over to Diviya's tonight? Veris' got cancelled so we're doing our own little thing.
No I haven't, is it good?
What happened? Ok maybe. Also, when should we watch moonrise
It's funny bc it's modern but they speak the way the book was written. And it's a rivalry between two mafia families. 
Nobody knows what happened, jay just told us in our game chat. He thinks it's a lie though and only wants the boys over 
What days are you free this week?
I'm free all of them. 
HAHAHAHAHA
Tell her no, we promise lol
Yeah but then would jay not be invited?
Sounds like a cool movie
Haha I already told her no, we would do it beforehand
No, jay just left for Mexico :(
Oh right 
Alright! My only thing scheduled for this week is a meeting I have at 7:30 am and pm on monday. Other that I'm free.
Great!
Btw you should listen to some music by Heatwave
Grooveline, Boogie nights 
So, when do you want to meet up
What would we do at Diviya's and who would it be
Okay, I'll listen to it! 
Well my mom leaves for work around 5:30 so we can leave at 6 and then get to Diviya's at 7:30 or something?
There's only drinking. Diviya's mom can provide some.
Basically everybody on the game chat plus Seth, Madeleine, and Ale but minus Jay 
Wait Diviya's mom is staying there??
This is ridiculous lol. Ok fun
No, she's going to Keshav'a for the night
Wait Zayna + company?
*keshav's
Lol she's a champ
Ok 6
No bc Joseph and Leo probably won't go
But even if they go it shouldn't matter yeah?
Mm not really I guess
I mean you will avoid each other anyway haha
What's up?
I'm about to get a haircut
Wbu
Oh yay! Are you getting a dye job?
Making cookies
No, just a blow job
Eh I wouldn't even be surprised anymore
Yeah, I'm really over the dye. The blow dryer adds enough 
Adds enough? What were you trying to accomplish with the dye?
What is that food
Schena?
I was just continuing the joke idk. 
It's a slow cooked dish with wheat, sweet potato, eggs, beef, potato
Sometimes other things
You cook it generally like 16 hours and eat on Saturday morning
I have a math degree. I'm very sharp
But I looked it up and can't find anything? Are you sure that's what it's called?
It's also called hamin
For Hanukkah? 
Schena is a transliterated Moroccan word I think? Perhaps archaic. Culture has changed much since 1960
No
Just every Saturday
Maybe it's from Yemen. I do not know. Yemen has the best food
Too bad you're not 
acute-ie.
:(
I think you should do Yemen for Global
If you were to go to synagogue would you go on Saturday?
We have been doing too many Middle Eastern countries lately
Mm probably Friday
Oh
Or Uzbekistan 
Or something
It's interesting
Armenia
 
The first pic
Is how I imagine your dad
She is just letting the food go cold
Did you sleep and eat yet?
Mm I wish that's what he looked like.
I ate
Wbu
I have used over 50 GB of data since I first got my phone...
Oh my god
Wait since when is that
And how much do you get/month
I didn't have service
I didn't have service
But now I do I guess
But now I do I guess
Which is strange but I'll take it
Hi
Hi
I know ugh
I know ugh
What did you do today
What did you do today
Well, we went to this lake, and it was frozen over!
So we threw rocks at it... Real mature I know but it was fun
Also sledddd
Sledded
And snowball fight
And this dumb kid fell through the ice cos he jumped
That sounds really awesome. Basically my winter last year minus the lake. And I think there was crying from our snowball fight bc they were too hard. 
Was it your first time doing anything today
Seeing a frozen lake!
Did you guys go on it or just throw rocks
Wtf Apollo Creed did not win
We went on it like briefly
What is that
The champion from rocky. He shouldn't have won.
Tre from Boyz n the Hood is so cute 
That movie :(
I think it's so important
Like as a cultural statement
And I'm here watching horrible bosses 2
I could not agree more, and it's still particularly relevant today.
I really like it. I wouldn't have watched it if you didn't 
It's scary how easy people succumb to peer pressure and how it ruins them.
Have you finished it
How were things with Boy Scout boy
No I'm 45 min into it.
Mm he was okay. We were partners for the pillow fight and made our fort together. Since we finished before everyone else we just sat there and talked. That was all.
I hung out with other Boy Scout boys for the most part haha.
Oh. It's really great.
Were you the oldest one there...? Not that that sounds horrible just not something normal 16 year olds do at sleepovers..
Boy Scout boy is also 16.. Actually, you know that kid who says he's a satanist? Ben? He was there. All the boys who played were either 14 or older.
We did normal stuff too, like watch Sherlock Holmes and Young Frankenstein
And actually, remember the republican kid who wanted me to send pics of him pray?
Him and I had a great discussion lots of things, like racism and The Interview. We even made fun of some movies as if we were feminazis and pointed out the dumbest shit haha
*about lots of things
Skylar.. What the fuck. He's an asshole
His name is also Ben
I heard my brother from his room ask, "Siri, am I going to die alone?"
Yeah... He went through this phase where he wanted to be called Skylar. He also tried to do something with a dead rabbit, idk. He really freaks me out...
Did the gf dump him
He's a really freaky and annoying and gross kid IMO
He's a Boy Scout??
My brother has been on the phone with someone for the past two hours. I don't know what's going on in his life.
He really is.. I don't know what to make of him. But he joined our Boy Scout troop around Halloween time. And this morning, we were going around talking about the latest we've stayed up and he said 3 days to watch a show. When we asked what show he gave us this glare and said, "Just. A. Show."
And he was talking about the feeling of burning hair and what the smell is like.
???!!!
He sounds like the opposite of the kind of guy who would join the scouts
Damn this movie. He was wrongly suspected and almost killed because he was driving that blue Volkswagen.
I think it's his dad who is making him join because the dad is trying to become active and attend the meetings.
Could you imagine if we lived like that? If we were raised in a neighborhood with helicopters constantly flying around and police cars patrolling every corner. And a neighborhood where the compromise is death. Where we constantly need to prove to other people we are worthy or more superior than another.
We are so fucking lucky
Or rather they are unlucky... It's a very rare situation
It's horrible though
That those who pretty much try to avoid it can make one bad choice and..
Or just be at the wrong place at the wrong time
Sometimes it's not about choice
Yeah :/
How are you guys watching Horrible Bosses 2? It's not on DVD yet, is it?
You know, I don't think these days there is anywhere as terrible as that. Compton is different now, with the crack epidemic out. In general LA is different. Manufacturing is gone. Hispanic people are in, black people are out. Not saying that is causal, but the demographics ARE very different
Or at least not areas so large
200000+ in one area in that fucked up condition in LA then
So you think a change in demographics, i.e. a more prevalent Hispanic population, significantly reduces criminal activity?
No no no
Exactly what I was trying to say- it isn't causal
Last night we were talking about white privilege, but the ex scout master's white son who is 19 told us to shut up and said, "does it affect you? No, so shut the fuck up and I don't want to hear it. It's not important."
I just thought that was interesting
He doesn't even know what affirmative action is and told me to shut up when I tried explaining it for the sake of my argument
Not that I doubt it's existence but I think this whole "privilege" thing is blown way out of proportion. First I thought I didn't get it cos I'm white, but I'm subject to a lot of the other minority things they talk about privilege for- not Christian not straight etc. 
Not saying it doesn't exist but I don't know why it has become such a buzzword and point of debate. There isn't really jack we can do about it like at all. 
It's kind of like when people insist being trans is a mental illness. Okay, I'll accept that argument if you so desire but what is the purpose? Insurance covers medicine for bipolar people..
Well treatment varies on the type of privilege you're subject for, like sexuality or religion or race. Obviously some things are more controversial to people than other things, and the point of the argument was to recognize how discriminatory we are towards people who aren't considered ideal.
And yeah there isn't much we can do about it, but we were having fun and spreading awareness.
So overall you had a good time?
I guess so. There were no water bottles though :( 
All there was to drink was soda.
And priscilla snapchatted me from Anthony's phone, which was nice bc I haven't talked to her in forever
It was my first time playing risk and I got all of North and South America
Are you?
Not really. I wish I was home. I dislike these people..
 I love risk
How is she
Why do you dislike them? How many people are there? Any kids?
Yes! We must play sometime. 
She's good I think. Not much you can say over snapchat hahah
10 people. I think. 4 kids besides me but all under 14. I'm just over the family appropriate bs. Like the adults keep it all very PG too and don't say or do anything interesting... At all. 
I can enjoy many things without intoxicants, like Madeleine's party, but I can't tone it down to age 8.
I've watched 11 movies this break!
Hahahahahahahahah that's surprising, didn't know you could do anything besides watch movies and indulge. 
But really that doesn't sound too bad. I mean what do you expect the adults to start doing? Beer pong?
Wow thx. No I expect them to have intelligent conversation, or watch a cool movie or... Something ya know
Hot leg
Hot leg
And love the movie
And love the movie
I am about the same. I will count. Know it is above 10
I am about the same. I will count. Know it is above 10
Do they just not feel like intelligent conversations are appropriate or do they not have time bc they're watching the kids?
The movie thing would piss me off, but I mean you were watching Horrible Bosses 2 so
Not exactly the most appropriate 
Wow, all you care about is the leg. Not my heart.
Just the body not the mind
I am watching it alone
Hot leg eh
Fuck the body screw the mind
I am on the 11th now
Why did you choose to watch that of all movies?!
I expect better things from you
Dunno it was popular
I'm on my 12th, suck it
Maybe I won't
Leg boy
American eagle fake fur bitch
:)
Watch Manhattan
Kate Winslet reminds me so much of Madonna 
She is like Madonna kinda
Really like her
Don't get why she isn't a bigger star
It will be at the top of 4 Watch
Sexism is hot
Sexism is hot
Sergio you are inferior to women. You don't even know how to use a car
Sergio you are inferior to women. You don't even know how to use a car
Bella does!
Bella does!
They have similar faces. 
And she was so good in Eternal Sunshine, even though I only got an hour in :(
Looks like somebody is asking for a spanking
Omg I remember in grade school my dad told me that if any woman said they were better than me, I just reply "at least I can pee standing up"
Yeah, you, ya bish
Klajbor...?
"At least I can give birth to children and continue the human race." -women
"At least I can give birth to children and continue the human race." -women
We don't need any more of those animals. They're already destroying this earth.
"At least I can play with my own boobs" -women
You play with mine lol. I've been thinking about that today for some reason.
 In a positive way?
Yes haha, I enjoy it. But I felt like you were only doing it because I enjoy it.
I didn't know you enjoyed it
I do it for me, but if you don't mind it that's a plus
What about the nipple thing?
I don't like saying it haha bc there are some things that sound weird when describing but in practice are very nice
I guess that's more equal but I still like doing it. Especially if you stay still so that I can actually have method 
Do I move around too much or something? This is good that we talk it out for next time.
And what do you mean method haha
You will see.
Lol next time we have more extended foreplay
Preferably when I'm on too
Too
Top
Are we serious about going up the mountain this week? Just for a day?
I'm really anticipating this extended foreplay and for you to be on top ;) 
Like I'm actually hard
Usually takes more to do that
Perhaps, it depends on if I'm feeling better and if parents agree, but I'm serious about it, I was thinking about it today
I was thinking about it, and this next time, I want to be aggressive with you, and like pin you down and shit
Some of my favorite memories with you are when you point out the plants and trees.
Fuck. Yes. Oh my goodness that would be the hottest thing ever.
We could probably stay late enough to see the sunset and then drive down
Mm I think if my parents agree they would definitely want me not driving in the dark. Maybe we can drive down a bit before and catch sunset at agua Caliente
I could like pull you out of your pants while holding you down and then ride... That would be awesome
Oh we get all aggressive and wrestle like they do in brokeback mountain hah
Fuck yeah exactly
This is going to be great if your parents agree! I can bring a tent and we can do a picnic kind of thing
Followed by rough and aggressive sex
I thought you didn't like being on top
I suggested it once and you said you really didn't like it
I like it in concept, I just think I need more practice.. Don't have he method down
The
Yes! In the forest-y part, but not the snowy part
Definitely :) but perhaps we can wonder off to the snowy part and play if you want to
Unless you've had enough by the end of this trip haha
You're always welcome to practice your method...
And we can play a board game!
Yeah sure, maybe Monday night? Or Tuesday?
Risk or whatever else you want 
Ya!
Sergio, I think this is the longest I've gone without jerking in so long
Which is only like a day and a half but
I want you, like damn
Monday night as in tomorrow haha? 
I want more than just a few hours with you 
Hahahahahaha
During the sleepover I kept thinking about grabbing your ass
Idk why that specifically, but I really wanted to
Do you sleep in a room alone? Maybe I can ease some tension...
Via snapchat hah
I am in a room alone right now but no lock 
But you should do it
Push my limits haha
Yeah tomorrow
You should grab my ass when we see each other 
But don't you get home late tomorrow? :/
No, not at all
I think Tuesday would be better if that's alright? I'm sorry
Should be home before 3, possibly as early as 12
Yeah it is better
You have scouts right
No scouts was cancelled because of the holidays
Well we can do Tuesday and have more time to prepare and stuff
You tell me some food you really like and I'll try my best to make it
I'll grab it real hard next time I see you ;)
I'll send snaps in a while if you're up for it
Totally up.
Lets just play board games, don't wanna pack too much in! Food for mountain picnic
Oh ok so then how's it going to work? What days are we doing what?
Dunno. Lets talk tomorrow? 
That was very satisfying for me
My Internet here is so fucken slow, it'll be a miracle if I can load the video in the next half hour
Idk if you got the video and stuff haha
Oh I'm sorry :( 
I redid the video quite a few times until it was me jacking off nice and slowly
Hahahahahja
Standing in anticipation
OMG it loaded
Gonna watch
Hahahah
Probably wasn't all that exciting but oh well
Niceeeeee
Lol you liar
That's what a 12 year old boy replies with after a girl sent a pic of herself with a bra on
No actually
Or maybe even just lifting the shirt a bit
Lol 
We are at the point where first base is anal
You sending a vid of that is like a bra pic for a boy who has seen vanilla porn, and yet, I was really into it
Cos you good b, you real good
Unfortunately I can only send 10 seconds
Did you... Do anything?
If it's not obvious, delete these texts
One step ahead of you bb
Ugh god I fucking want to, but I can't risk it
Do you sleep alone?
No, on the sofa, and there's another sofa with someone on it sleeping
Lol we just planned a drinking Skype night for Friday
Over evil apples chat
A what?
So basically we drink on Friday night and then all Skype each other haha
And then we're gonna watch a movie or something
Does anyone other than you Diviya and I have alcohol?
Can I join this...?
So far it's just me and jay, and Martha says she'll think about it. Diviya said no.
Why did Diviya say no
No idea. Maybe she really is giving it up
Maybe she doesn't want to drink alone
Yeah it would be strange doing that while living in an apartment
W your mom next to you 
but jay told me he wouldn't mind doing it just with me
Are we really not doing anything for New Years
It's a travesty
They actually wanted me to ask you but I didn't bother bc you said no more parties 
Well
If it was a really small group of us maybe. 
But literally like 6 or less
So idk probably not
Anyway tho I gotta go
Goodnight
I love small parties
Bbbbbbbbbbbbbb
I don't get the obsession with inviting the whole 11th grade
 3
Okay! Goodnight <3
Upi loves
Upi loves
Haha what
I don't even know how you came up with that name
3 random letters more or less
Are you already on your way back?
Yep
When was the last time you went to Israel?
Have you ever been in Israel while something was going on, either in the city you were visiting or another?
Also why did your parents decide that Tucson was the ideal place to start a family?
Hi sorry just got service
I last went November 2013
Once I was in a restaurant, and there was a news flash that a nearby restaurant had exploded. Later turned out to be natural gas, but suspicious and probably linked to organized crime
Also once we were there in 2006 days before the war
They didn't decide. My dad's job just brought him to Tucson
Plus my mom wanted to go to UA, had one of the top PhD programs in her field (Management Information Systems. Don't ask cos I have no idea what it really is)
 
Why would you guys go there in 2006 when something like that was about to occur?
Lol so then do you know what your mom does? Other than writing really technical papers.
Is that the frozen lake? It looks very thin.
No wonder he fell in haha.
The first picture is the best.
So what are our plans for this week?
Don't really have any.
Yes it's the lake, it was thin at some point, pretty thick (4in+) at others
Well we didn't know it was about to happen... Basically my mom didn't bring me to Israel between 2000 and 2006 for fear of conflict but decided it was long enough and had been decently stable. So we went. And it was fine, but after we left it wasn't
No, I meant the plans we were making for the mountain and board games.
Oh. Yes
What games? Risk requires more people
I probably have a chess and checker set around somewhere
Hmmm what else
I kind hate those games lol
We can go to bookmans and buy a board game?
Maybe a ouija board!
When I get home I'll check what I have-- I have a lot
Wanna save $
But if not, sure
Ouija sounds cool
Our friends are driving in another car and their brakes somewhat broke. 
Ouija was a joke, but you should check
I was told never to mess around with ouija boards
Oh I thought you've been home since 3 lol
If shit went as I desired and thought, we would. They left late and decided to stop at every place possible. So we won't be home til 6 at the earliest
Lol why no ouija
Oh I thought you've been home since 3 lol
I finished Titanic, Little Town of Bethlehem, and now I'm on Beverly Hills Cop. Yayyy
Hahaha. What do you mean stop? Like for potty breaks?
No I mean to see obscure monuments
Tell me if Beverly Hills cop is good
Haha we can do ouija if you want to. But what if it actually works...
Such as?
It's your stereotypical crime comedy
Nothing spectacular
3 vista points, we drove 35 minutes on a dirt road leading nowhere, we stopped at this national monument land bridge but it was a 30 minute hike to it, so they went for 15 min and gave up and came back, at a cost of like $50
Wtf. That sounds like such a waste of time and money. "Yes Emily, we saw a national monument land bridge. I know, you're just jealous my kids got this once in a lifetime experience."
The rest stops are fine though. I always get my rest stop Doritos.
No rest stops lol
Literally more
None
Have you ever gotten off in a public bathroom?
No.......???!!!
Also there should be rest stops..?
It's not that unusual actually.
Last year I was super horny 24/7 so I did it everywhere
We were not on major interstates, so there were little towns, but we didn't stop there.
Where all did you do that....?
Are you joking
The Bank of America, Baggins, federal buildings
And many more places I assure you
Those are just a couple I remember
I am not joking...
I knew about THE Bank of America
Why couldn't you just hold it in til you got home
That's pretty gross b
Like what if I sit on the toilet and there's dried cum on it
That's nasty
Did I actually tell you about the Bank of America?
Yes
With grant, no?
Well what can you do when you have a hard cock in a public bathroom
Gosh I don't know
Glory hole?
Idk I was like barely 15
You don't even use public bathrooms so lucky you :)
With Grant????
And I'm too scared of glory holes. What if they're a biter or have a dirty mouth. Bleh.
I do! Just not at school
I thought there was some story that he was workings there or something
Lol fair enough
I would probably suck a glory hole dick if conditions were right
Clean etc.
Oh, right. I've been in the Walmart bathroom with you haha.
Yeah, he was working at a federal building. The story was that I called asking for my mom but he answered.
But when I jacked off it was a different story
I was sent by my mom to go to the 9th floor or something to get some clothes for a client
And then I had spare time so I jacked off in the bathroom
And now you sometimes don't jack off for a couple days and then you couldn't keep it in for a few hours
I would not go near a glory hole unless I was in some 5 star hotel or something.
Well I'm having sex regularly so there's no need! I did last night though.
"I wouldn't care if I lost my virginity to some guy in the back of El Super"
Is that something I said?
Yeah, you said that when we were talking about how I lost my virginity to you.
God I'm brilliant
It's true tho
I wonder why someone would drive that off into a lake
What do you mean you're brilliant?
It's just a really funny statement IMO
Back when Anthony and I used to do those Skype sessions and whatnot
He told me I could give him head
But then he got really sad and said he was crying 
So of course I asked what was wrong
And he told me that he couldn't do it. I was just a child and that I deserved so much better 
And that I should wait for it to be special
I thought that was really considerate 
-sorry-
He said that he feels guilty for robbing my childhood 
To be honest I thought you weren't a virgin
Well, in retrospect what he did is really fucked up even if you did want it
I have a responsibility to not do anything with 8th graders even if they go after me
Though in your case you were not an innocent kid at all before him
I'm not upset with you or criticizing you, I just wanted to share that. 
It really means a lot now
More than it did at the time.
Yeah I understand that
But he did let it go relatively far still..
He really beat himself up about it after we ended things...
And he apologized all the time
And he suggested I get with Shawn lol.
It was all very dramatic
His "birthday gift" to me was his dick
15th birthday present whoooooo
Lolllll
Seriously though you don't have to buy me anything, a dick in a box really would make an alright 17th
Didn't you play with his balls or something? But you didn't blow him?
No, the most we did in person was touching and making out. Although he would steal my phone sometimes and I would get on him to get it back but he still had it
Are you joking
No I think it would be funny
Even if not a surprise
I'll do that for Valentine's Day :)
Lol ok
I'm jk that's trashy
I guess I could for your 17th along with real gifts
I don't care!
Have you ever had someone to give things to for Valentine's Day 
Yeah but not like in a romantic way
I don't think 
I'll make this a poster
Or a shirt
Like an all over shirt. 
When is that from
BASIS should have used that picture instead of using Dun
We were in the park while it was raining
The wild basis senior
And you took two pictures and made one my background haha
Oh when I was in your arms
Yesss did you change it
In my arms?
You were holding me
We stayed in the front seat the whole time
Oh that time
I really want to do that :(
I did change it because I was afraid my mom or brother would see it
I just really want you!!!!!!
COS YOU 'SHAMED O ME
Jk
He's funny
And chubby
Haha I'll change it back to a nicer picture
Of you
No no no it's fine lol I was joking
I'm trying to get him into more feminine toys 
"Hey, don't touch me there!! Hey! It's my no-no square" -what the kids have been singing for the last 2 days
Like what?
Actually it's "stop! Don't touch me there! That is my no-no square"
Haven't heard that in years
Like this my little pony doll we have haha
I meant "stop don't touch me there, stop it's my no-no square" that's what they said. Without the second stop it isn't a good song
And when we play with dolls I say it's okay for the boys to kiss
Your mom bought him a pony doll?
I don't think they get the gravity of the "song"
Lol next time we mess around
"STOP DON'T TOUCH ME THERE!"
I think he got it on accident from a happy meal lol.
I don't even know where that song originated from 
Kids don't understand the gravity of ring around the rosie 
We have so many things to say next time we mess around haha
What else
Oh hell no
Bitch 4 year old stealing my girl
Well I remember agreeing on saying some funny things during sects haha
For some reason he's been calling me his girlfriend all day
Ah new jacket
Old jacket
And flat hair. Is that new?
Nope, lazy day
And no supplies in cabin
Sects
I wrote that on purpose because I felt like it
And I was gonna make a joke but I forgot it :(
I'm going to get a haircut this week I can't do this anymore
What are you getting
It's funny that you always ask that question because it's the same haircut all the time 
And whenever I ask what I should get you don't know
This time I know
You should get your normal cut
My brother is such an asshole
?
We were eating and then he randomly says "so what is it? A boy or a girl? It's not a boy because it had female part so what is it"
And then I told him he's a disgusting person and he said "I'm disgusting?" And laughed
Which brother lol
12 year old one
Lovin the "it" nice finishing touch
I told him that "it" is for animals then he told me to shut up
He is such an idiot
Eh, that's not news
I just don't understand why the fuck he had to bring it up
Of all things
Yeah really
Now he locked himself in his room
And he grabs my Alex's arm and yells at him
He's just like his dad
That couch is a crime
Poor Alex
He is so cute
The floral couch haha?
Our aunt bought it when she lived here. It was her bed and then when she moved out she never took it
You have no idea how I much I wish he was away from all of this depravity
I love him so much so I spend lots of time with him bc I don't want him to end up like Richie 
Well, he will have so much time alone with your mom if you don't stay in town :( 
It also upsets me because she is working all the time and doesn't read with him or do any fun parent things like she did with me.
Like I used to have schedules on the refrigerator and little writing exercises and interactive computer games
Anyway I'm sorry
Are you home yet?
Just got home
That's unfortunate 
Can he read yet
Great!!!! Hopefully you can shower and sleep
I can't
No water
Pipe burst
:(
He can't read yet...
While you were gone?!
No, just before we left
He is 4 he should be somewhat reading, no???
We wanted to get it fixed while we were out but it was weekend
How long will it be until it's fixed then?
Exactly :( he should be reading.
I sit with him sometimes and I go over his alphabet and the sounds that each letter makes
But I wish my mom did that too.
She can't just depend on having him learn at school. She should want him to get ahead.
Especially if he's going to the basis kindergarten
Dunno, hopefully tomorrow. 
Hopefully basis kindergarten will give him the push he needs. I'm sure they don't expect you know much going in
I wonder what the curriculum is for the kindergarteners.
Did you ever see that movie kindergarten cop?
That movie scarred me as a child 
Have you jacked off yet
Good point! I'll do that
I have not
You'll watch the movie? Arnold Schwarzenegger is in it hahaha.
I'll jerk
Ugh I really want to have sex with you
 too!!
I can't believe you came last time
It is true
Fuck it I'm going to jack off too 
Dooooo itttt
I already am haha
So are your family friends staying for New Years?
Do you make resolutions?
Yes, leaving morning of jan 1
I don't
Do you
Hi sorry I just finished.
No, but I think it's funny to hear other people's resolutions and then bring it up months later when you see them forget about it.
I did resolutions like two years ago.
I think it's cool though that people use the new year to say they'll stop acting like assholes or lose weight
I'm gonna watch the interview tonight!
On what medium 
It's called putlocker. But it's in HD and everything, very nice.
 Oh yeah you spoke of it
No, it's how Jay watched it and I decided to do the same. Eminem is in it lol.
Eminem is gay in the movie
"I mean, it's kinda like I been playin gay peekaboo"
Haha
Hahahahahja
When you see people
Who are hipsters of 2005
Long hair
Tevas
Earth colors
Cargo pants
What about them?
Just a rare sight now
See them in sprouts all the time
Wow
Will be back in a bit going out
Ok cool
Hi
Hey
What'd you do
Saw this movie troll 2
Oh you went w Sophia
Yeah Twas sudden again 
What's the plan tomorrow
No idea
I didn't think we were gonna do anything so I'm still home
:(
Will you not be in town tomorrow
You know, we could go to colossal cave or something
No clue. Might be in town sometime after 10:30am
Ok. Tell me if you are it would be really great to meet up
Alright
Colossal is expensive btw so not a good idea
Ok. Hmm 
Well, if you get into town tomorrow be sure to tell me
Sometime I would like to see vail but if there isn't anything to do there
There isn't anything to do
Unless you're old
No natural things?
It's all desert and bushes
I like those things
But ok
Are you ok
I wouldn't want you wasting gas. It's 20 min south of Martha's.
Yup, why do you ask
Anyway you're probably asleep
Goodnight 
Goodnight
Though I'm not
And won't be for a bit
Sorry I spaced
You usually are at this time
I know
What movies did you see today
Little Town of Bethlehem, The Interview, and Beverly Hills Cop
How was interview
Should I see it
Anyway I just really don't feel like talking, I feel nauseous. I'm sorry.
It's alright. Turns out it doesn't trivialize what I said as much.
In fact the movie revolves around that towards the end
Anyway goodnight
Goodnight
What is your problem
Are you okay????
Yes?? 
I think we are both ok
I feel terrible
Like I'm getting sick.
Anyway whatever
I'm sorry
:( both of us
I feel like such an asshole towards you
I was just upset today
Don't worry about it though
Well I'm not too sick, but I have coughed a few times
Why were you upset
I'm not that sick either but it felt like my appendix was gonna explode earlier. Afraid I'm allergic to some food
No, it's dumb
What did you eat on your trip
No say it, we can clear it up
First, look at my card
Also it was just lots of things, not really do do w you. So it really doesn't matter 
Hahaha
Are you really sure? I won't judge
But not pushing
Fuck you
You know what it is
I don't even feel like saying
Because you're not an idiot
Ok, I thought so
Let me say this
She lives 2 minutes away from me and is here for a total of 1 week
I'm not gonna be a dick
I have wanted to see you all the time this break but it's a lot harder because you are actually busy plus I can't just come over there for a sec cos it's 30 min away
I'm sorry. 
And I feel like this goes without saying but obviously nothing is going on there. At all
Anyway, she's leaving in the next 2 days so it doesn't matter
But I like you a lot more than her, of course
I care about you
You make me feel great about myself
I really don't want this to be an issue between us...
It's not! I just won a game of Evil Apples so I wasn't replying. 
And I understand so that's why I felt like it shouldn't matter and I feel like I should just get over it. 
But I mean obviously it gets to you
I'm sorry though.
Don't be sorry. I wish I could make you more secure about me and other people. 
Congrats, is that your first win
Well I think it's more of the fact that you used to do things with her, you know? Like if I started hanging with Shawn sporadically throughout the week I would expect you to be concerned or upset. I feel like that's natural, so I just didn't want to bring anything up but you kept insisting.
Hahah no, it actually tells you how many you win if you tap the little profiles.
I have won.....
6 games
Goddamn
Did you spend $
Well you see
(don't laugh)
Oh god
I've lost 17 :(
Hahah no money, but I've only won that many because I've played so many games
I do spend the coins I win though. I bought a deck today.
Anyway Aimee I'm really sorry about getting upset.
And I shouldn't have lied to you like that.
Oh that's not even that bad
No it's really fine and natural, yeah but hopefully we can be open about things
I want enough coins to buy one but I am pretty short
Only like 160 now
Well Nathaniel is really sweet
And he does these games where we tell each other our cards
That way we each take turns getting coins
Can we do that lol
Of course! You were just out of town when we did those haha
You cheater
Wanna start one?
Actually believe it or not
They're all asleep!
We could invite a random person?
We finished our game like 5 minutes ago, so KZ and I have been chatting.
Oh
Or we can invite KZ
Lol that would be being jerks to him
How so? If we take turns it's fine, right?
Oh, yeah ok.
Or how about
Like we play a game for real until someone has 6 points
Then we help out the others
Alright! Right now?
Ya
You're not feeling tired?
Nuer
Niet
Nuer
Are you
Not really. I've been up until at least 2 every night for the past couple of days
Great
Hahah yay for sleep deprivation 
Are you making a game
Oh I thought you were haha. How do I add random people?
Just add me and KZ?
Aww he just said he has to go to the library tomorrow
So he needs to sleep
You should watch the interview though, it's really not that bad
Just to watch it
I can send you the link over email or fun chat
*FB chat lol
Ok
Well
I'm gonna rent it legally
A bit pretentious aren't you
A tad
Nah I just want to support
Them
Oh, thanks for clarifying. I thought you meant the movement to assassinate Kim Jong Un.
That 2
Honestly, pretty shitty asshole
I read this brilliant post
In the movie he's actually really sweet
About how he does brilliant PR to make the west world consider him a joke instead of the genocidal prick he is
So we make jokes
And don't overthrow him and liberate NK
I thought he refused to do any PR???
As in
His ridiculous threats
And persona
And ridiculous things he says he accomplishes
Ohhhhh yes. The movie does a good job about pointing all of that out.
Like literally what you just said
That post is the movie
And they mention his threats and the concentration camps and everything
I will be sure to see it
You know, they are showing all these cool French films at the loft next month
Would be great to see
Oh!!! Did I miss Gone with the Wind? :(
Also, terminator 2 is on the 2nd and third
Think so
Breakfast at Tiffany's is showing in February WE MUST GO
OMG Sergio
Casablanca on valentine's day at loft :)))))))))
Oh I must watch the first one again then. It's been so long since I've seen any Terminator movie.
:) that is a must.
We have to go see it.
Ok we will have to go early
Especially since I've never seen it!
Damn it I missed Rosewater
What is tidewater
Rose*
Omg we should see the Oscar nominated short films on Feb 4
It's a documentary about an Iranian journalist who was imprisoned
You should listen to "Ba'dem Alby" by Amr Diab on his album Romantic Hits.
Ok sure!
Oh
Ok I will
In the morning actually cos I'm going to sleep
Goodnight for realsies
Okay!
Hahahah
Goodnight ❤️❤️❤️
Having
Habibi
Having a Habibi the Musical!
Jk that was dumb
Lol
I hated that show
Max was a dumbass and ruby was bitchy AF
And condescending
Hahaha. Was she his mom or older sister?
I had such a strange dream
Basically I was at the loft with this other family from my church watching bob the builder
And the mom of one of the kids sat next to me and I started scratching her head and I said "don't worry, this is what I do to my mom"
Then my mom came
Just really strange
Wbu?
Older sister
That is strange...
I got an unnecessary and out of place lecture from family friend about why I'm a dick, so that was nice
And I played backgammon
Where are you
In real life or in a dream??
I'm still home but I think I'll be in town today. What did you want to do
Real life
Board games at park?
Well what did you do to deserve that lecture? How were you being a dick?
Sure, we need some tho
Well, I stay in my room a lot and don't really talk to them and she is very involved with her kids, so she thinks it makes me a dick, because she only hears my mom's side of things ever
Truuuuu
I kinda knew that's what it was about. What does your mom say about you?
Did you look for some?
I think she is hurt. But there are some things that I can never forgive people for and her treatment of me when I came out is one of them, so I don't really care. 
Ok I have this cool penguin game
And taki (Hebrew card game)
Mastermind
Manuals
Mancala
:( but you don't think she is trying to make an effort by taking you to your appointments in LA?
Or encouraging you to come out and talk to family and friends because she wants your company?
Is taki two player? Also what's manuals?
Aimee you have to understand that it's difficult for parents to know what's going on when their children come out
As hard as it is for you, it's also as hard for them 
And you also must take into account where they grew up
I don't care if she makes an effort, it's too late. I know there are many factors into why she acted the way she did but it does not change how miserable she made me. I've heard this a million times, Sergio, it doesn't change the fact that I will never, ever forgive her.
Not that this is on the same scale at all, but if hitler honestly believed what he was doing was right, it would not change my judgment of him an inch
What exactly did she do to make you feel terrible? How did your dad react and did your parents ever argue?
If you don't want to answer that's fine
I don't
Anyway lets meet up around 5? Is that too late
I don't think it's too late
Might even be too early actually
And taki and the others are all 2 player
Which ones are you going to bring?
And if it gets late we can play at library or seven cups or bookmans. Idk.
Probably all 
Sounds good
Tell me when you are ready
Btw I look really bad bc I need a haircut so don't judge 
Did you find Michael Jackson attractive after plastic surgery?
Also don't forget you have my bag and charger
I did not find him hot
Only before
Ok I will not forgot!
Forget
Currently at movie w Reza so I will ttyl :)
Oh ok cool
Ttyl
Hi
Hey what'd you see
Theory of Everything
Oh cool how was that?
Pretty great, inspiring I guess
Well that's good. How's Reza
Are we still gonna play
He's good but his facial hair is like pubes
Ya, I will bring all we need
Oh ok well I've been in town for a while
Like its thick and all over the place?
No... I'll describe later
Ok I'll be over at probably 540
Ok cool
Wait shit what bag
It's a Downton Abbey World Market bag 
Fuck
I will bring it back to you next time I'm sorry
:(
Also I will be there at 530 actually
Don't worry about it
Ok
Here
I'm with my family friend and she is caring for this disabled girl. She is 23 but looks 13. She can't talk, she just grunts, and puts her arms up as if to cower. It's so sad
:(
Do you know what she has or what happened to her? 
That is really sad. Probably can't go to college or get a well paying job.
Just think about parents who are expecting an independent child but now have this lifelong responsibility.
You know I don't care about getting myself sick just to kiss you. I would do it regardless.
It's congenital. No, she's like mentally not there at all. I doubt she ever went to school
I know it's so sad
I feel bad, I don't want you to have this
Alex had a very high chance of being born with spina bifida... Or with some other congenital defect. Mom was in the hospital for about 3 weeks or something.
During MUN you were really sick and I didn't get it.
Although I remember you saying, "what if I coughed on your dick"
She was abused and they left her in a cage outside for years :(
To sleep- not all day
It's great he turned out fine
That is so inhumane and disgusting. Who does that?! This was her parents, correct?
Maybe foster parents not sure
But now she's living with the family friend? How did the friend find her?
It's temporary. She has a permanent (ish) family, by they
But they are out of town right now
Who exactly is this family friend? What does she do and how do you guys know her? Why do you visit her alone without your parents?
So
She was my childhood babysitter, she basically raised me
I visit her alone when I'm in the area because she is far out
Awwww that is so sweet of you to do. She's totally accepting and everything?
Anyway I'm falling asleep
So tired idk why
Goodnight, shall I see you tomorrow before the party? Or will I get a ride?
Yeah, I'll drive you!
Sorry I am driving
Goodnight
Alright, I'm free all day so we can meet up earlier or whatever you want. See you tomorrow! :)
Weird weird dream that we were on this highway with guns trying to shoot other cars
Yet the biggest problem was that on our way back home
We switched phones on accident for a whole day
So I became smarter since yours had a bunch of news apps and you stayed the same
What
Lol
This reflects your mindset, perhaps, but I'm sure your phone, by now, has more intelligent apps
Haha
So I forgot that I am at bridge til 5, and then might have some early evening engagements. I'll keep you posted
I'm supposed to go to a NYE thing at Veris's real house
Idk what times it is, he is supposed to be there, I should probably contact him
What's up
Oh alright, that sounds good! Did you ever know how to play Mao? The one where they were silent and refused to tell you the rules?
Yes, my mindset. You know all I really want to do is drive a huge hippie van on I-10 and start shooting passing cars. A real turn on.
Also we have to do the New Years kiss! And I have a present for you
I am babysitting until 1? So my brother is watching Wreck It Ralph and I'm trying to read Dorian Gray haha. Going to eat soon though. Wbu?
Veris used to play that game with me. I got very frustrated.
Really? We can go shooting together :)
Yes!!
I'm watching fatal attraction
Aww if Nate can't go to Veris' party, then Diviya is going to go to dinner with him instead and sacrifice party time. That is really sweet.
YES THAT GAME WAS SO ANNOYING I wanted to stab everyone playing it.
Have you ever shot a gun?
You've been watching that since last week? You like it so far?
Modern premature drinking age love
That is really sweet
I haven't, have you?
Didn't have decent Internet while we were gone so yeah
I do like it but the build up is worrying
Yes, so many guns ever since I was 6 or 7. I grew up with guns in the house so I had to learn. I'm much better with a bow though.
How did you watch Breakfast at Tiffany's?
Then be prepared for literally the last half hour or forty five minutes, that's basically all it is.
Does your mom keep guns
I downloaded it ;((
As if they have DVD players
She does not keep guns, unfortunately. So I haven't lived in a home with a gun for a few years now.
Exactly!!!!
Such a waste of money
They're just asking for trouble. It is literally one of the dumbest ideas.
Oh, you bad boy.
It's on Netflix you know. You could be wasting your computer's space with other movies haha
I know, I just didn't have Internet right so I couldn't stream there, and I knew I wouldn't be able to stream
I am pro gun too
But you could have downloaded a movie on your list that's not on Netflix and watched Tiffany's when you get back, no?
Oh ok I figured you were. The girls get really upset with me for being pro gun.
But I don't think they understand that a police call won't solve all their problems
I feel like you have some perspective here from living in an area that isn't upper middle class and predominantly white when you were younger. Some areas are dangerous as hell!
I could have but I didn't realize it was on Netflix. I tried to pick a film that wasn't on it. Oh well
Actually, it was predominantly Hispanic and around 1/4 white. But I encountered a lot when I was younger. Like I was home alone with my brother and a babysitter when I was 5, and this man pulls up to our house and asks for a cup of water. Being only 5, I let him in and he looked around. Then the next day he returned with friends and tried breaking in.
They started banging on windows really hard and ringing the doorbell over and over again
It was the scariest thing ever. And I had to call the police because our babysitter couldn't speak English.
I had to hide my brother in the closet and then go help my babysitter
And how long did it take officers to respond?!!! Hmmm
They showed up after my parents had returned home from work
There is no fucking way I will live without a gun
Many of our neighbors had their homes broken into though. Lots of nearby shootings. 
Our neighbors were drug dealers
That's what I'm saying, you are the only one of them who lived in a shit area
That's really scary
Where was this, again?
Oh, I read your text as "living in an area that isn't upper middle class, but predominantly white"
So I was really confused 
East Golf Links, like by Davis Monthan Air Force base 
The place where many cars have been stolen and then left on fire
Oh, I didn't even know that was a bad area! Wait, near Santa Rita high school??
Oh no, it's west Golf Links, sorry. East of Pantano the neighborhoods get better. 
I had this friend from elementary whose father owned the Donut Wheel down the street lol
She was Asian
Arabs defending themselves
Wait what major cross streets? I have no idea where this is..
Potatoes gonna Potatoe
Basically from Golf Links and Swan to Golf Links and Prudence
Potate. Like po-tate.
She made some comment about Nubians and called them monkeys
Then said they probably wouldn't understand her music
Oh no, Algerians wouldn't understand the music
I finished Fatal Attraction
Glad at the ending
Ohpotate
Oh potate
I do not understand
What this Arab drama is. Care to explain
What are Nubians
Aka why we need to be pro gun
^ end of fatal attraction.
Obsessed is the same thing but with Beyoncé.
Nubians I believe live in south Egypt?
Oh she was condemning Algeria because of their actions during the 2009 World Cup.
And she probably commented on Nubians because they're black.
There was no World Cup in 2009?
What action
Oh it was the South Africa Fifa confederations cup
Your pic you sent doesn't seem to have any relation to caption I am confused
It says "I am love"
That was her pic but she put the caption 
Like that is all her, I just thought it was funny
During the qualifying matches for the 2010 World Cup there were disputes between Egypt and Algeria 
What should I see next
What should you see next
Next I am seeing The Gatekeepers and The Usual Suspects.
You should watch Hotel Rwanda.
That is actually on my list
Not on the actual one but mental list
Well it's leaving Netflix today so you should watch it
Where did you find The Gatekeepers?
Barnes n Novak
Noble
Ok, if I have time
The advertisements for all the movies before gatekeepers all look really good
Oh what's up?
Are they in English
I'm playing bridge with Diviya and Zellmer and Joseph
Until 5
They are all in English, but the actual movie itself is in Hebrew. There is this animated movie it showed called Waltz with Bashir about the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Looks amazing.
Oh well have fun! :)
Can I pick you up at 6
Of course
Also I couldn't do formal bc I didn't pack for it
Ok then I won't either
Might be a bit later
That's fine. Thanks for letting me know.
Actually, I'm gonna be a lot late. I gotta jump by home. Sorry :(
Hahah that's all right.
Just let me know when.
Just left my house
Here
And I love you too
Yay we're going home tonight so I can watch a movie
Yay!
When
Also what was the context of that love you text?
Well my mom wants to see a movie tonight.... But I don't want to. We'll probably be home around 10 or 11, and if you're still up we can do the Skype movie tonight or tomorrow.
"And I love you too"
Ok. Alright, I might be up. Text me for sure
Wow. Xóchitl sent me a really really long reply, basically repeating all the "you're amazing and smart" kind of stuff.
Yeah, why did I send that at 12:55?
Ok cool <3
I had no idea to be honest I was very confused
How long? That's really sweet of her
"Hey Sergio. I'm so glad you are feeling well. Don't apologize to me though. I'll take the thank you but not the sorry. 😊 Seriously. You have reason to feel sorry. Being there with you to talk to you and support you--that is the only place I wanted to be and the only thing I wanted to be doing at that moment at the party. It was my choice not an obligation of any kind. I wanted to make sure you felt safe and cared for because you are such an amazing, brave and wonderful human being. You deserve all the happiness and ease in the universe and it makes me sad that anyone would hurt you in any capacity. Your sweetness, honesty and vulnerability are inspiring. I respect you wholeheartedly. If you ever need a shoulder to cry on or someone to listen to you, I will always be there if you want to reach out. Have a fucking awesome evening 😊 "
I was very confused as well haha. I don't think it was safe to have my phone at that time.
Wow.
Yes in the future you should probably not have that on hand
Trivia Crack?
I feel like she's just saying it to say it. She obviously did not come with the intention to watch over me. Also I don't think you're seeing somebody in their prime while drunk. 
Did Veris get back to you on our shot glasses?
Do you have any other games that I should play?
I agree with you, but I think the intention was there.
And yes, he did. It's all good.
What kind of game
Yes I also agree. Although you guys say she's a little bitchy, I couldn't really find what made you guys think that.
Any game you think I would like!
Preferably something intellectual
I like bridge
But it is very hard to learn
I thought you said steep learning curve? When did you learn to play?
Yeah. Joseph taught me sometime over the summer
Are you kidding me
How will a Skype movie work? Do we both watch on foreign Netflix and Skype?
Yes
That's the idea at least
Does your family have any New Years traditions
Do you guys watch fireworks
No, we usually do that on the 4th
They bought champagne but didn't stay up to open it lol
Do you
Does 4th go crazy on New Years haha? Also I wonder if anybody we know saw the taco drop
Sounds like a big step for your mom who doesn't drink haha
We go to the TEP firework show at the park with my uncle and then out to dinner. It's nothing special. Then we go home and text each other happy New Years
Oh, the 4th of July
Lol was it a real taco
No no, I think TEP is also responsible for NYE fireworks? Idk there's this park on the south side that does fireworks early. 
Absolutely! Jk, no. Hotel congress hired some artist to make it, and it looked really cool.
I meant we watch fireworks on the 4th of July but have no NYE traditions. Though it is cool they do that
That's a legit taco
Oh sorry, I had thought you said that you go to 4th ave to watch fireworks.
Btw I'm home
Great. And I just finished kill bill
You didn't like it, did you?
I think I liked it somewhat? It was cool, but not my type of film
Shit is rough for me this round of trivia crack
I was so scared during that challenge. I only won by one.
It was so hard!
Well then I don't recommend Vol. 2...
Vol 2 is really bad
Well, I feel like I have to finish it at some point. If only for the story
In the beginning I kept getting extremely easy questions. For one of the art questions it asked how do you say tree in Spanish.
Well you can watch it but it's very strange. Like she goes to this temple to meet an old Asian Kung fu master. 
Apparently linoleum is not an official surface to play tennis on, according to Trivia Crack. Fuck sports.
Lol
Eh, this one was all kung fu filled too
My phone died in the middle of a q
Wtf
At 8%..
Hahah so what happened?
Did you have to redo?
Landed on crown and answered the capital of Ukraine, yessssss
Congrats!!
It said I ran out of time
That's so lame! I'm sorry :(
I was going to challenge you so I would lose one but I wanted at least one win
At least I considered
She looks super high
Lol don't try to lose!!!
I want a fierce competition
She does... Did you take that pic? She looks awful!
Yes :( it's on my snapchat story.
What are you doing now
I was just waiting on the Internet until you were ready to skype
I'm ready
Idk if we will get through it all, I'm pretty tired
I kept thinking about how funny it would be if you fell asleep 
Haha
Donde estas 
Callin you on Skype
You can watch it on Vimeo for free lol
The interview?
No, cabaret.
Did you like it 
Honest 
I really do! It's such a masterpiece
And Sally is so exuberant I love her
Took a while to get into though
It sad how it becomes clearer how deeply upset she is and how she covers it by the façade of an exciting and interesting life
Well I'm only 45 min in, so I'm at the first real kiss between her and the roommate English teacher.
But it looks like she has a drinking problem
Oh... I thought you had finished
OMG him
Fucken love him
No, I went to sleep before 12 for once
 too!
Can you explain why the end of the Weimar is creating so many problems? Basically it's the end of Hitler's rule?
Nope-- opposite. Hitler is on the rise
Though not yet the sole head of the government 
Oh right right, yes.
How does this effect the Kit Kat Klub?
The KKK
*affect
You mean the Cabaret? (Forgot what that is)
Yes, the cabaret.
Well, the moral values dictated by Nazism differ greatly from those of the Cabaret. But it's mostly not about how it affects the cabaret itself but instead the people Sally comes to know. You will see
Do you know much about the religious aspects of Nazism? I mean I know that they condemned Judaism.
Also if that is so, then why does a Nazi go inside the club and then get kicked out?
Well, they were somewhat affiliated with the Catholic Church (as was Mussolini), which continues to be a large criticism of the Catholic Church
They do not like Nazis.
But as the Nazi power increases, they cannot continue doing that
But why would a Nazi even enter the cabaret in the first place if the two had opposing moral values?
I do not know
Oh ok. What's up? What are you gonna do today
I'm watching the terminal
And my plan is to watch the terminal
And maybe work maybe not
Wbu
I guess I lied
Because I am sick :( I feel awful and tired. But my mom is making me do all these things today and tomorrow since she signed me up to staff at Boy Scout camp this summer...
I really need to work though. I don't have time for things like that. And I told her I didn't want to staff and she said "give up scouts or give up your phone" 
What's the terminal?
My head really hurts :(
What are you doing? 
Wait doing you mean "and"? You could give up scouts and keep your phone?
Bb I told you not to kiss me :(
The terminal is about a guy who falls through a legal loophole and must reside in an airport
I'm in bed but can't fall asleep. But I need to be preparing for some camp staff meeting tomorrow. 
Basically she says I can quit scouts if I give her my phone. It's really dumb.
I know :( haha but it's fine
Reside in an airport? Hahaha hopefully it's one of those fun airports with a host of shops and entertainment
That is really dumb. Why aren't you rushing to finish eagle? And build that bench or whatever. Then you will be done, no?
No it's not fun-- his country was caught in a civil war and dissolved so his passport is not valid and he has no money or anything, and they are trying to get him to voluntarily leave so they can arrest him
Well regardless of whether or not I have my eagle, she thinks it's important to keep active in the troop and with activities.
But I also want to get that started soon
Oh... Yeah that does not sound fun at all haha. How did you find this movie?
I really don't think I can go to the movie thing tomorrow at Martha's damn 😭
Why does she care if your do BS?
Well, I read a wiki article about a true story that happened to a guy, he stayed ok a French airport for 17 years. It said this film was based on that, so I was intrigued
Why not
She says I need to keep my mind active and stay busy, as if I wasn't active or busy enough with school. 
That does sound intriguing, I just read the wiki article about him and the movie. I'll add it to my watch list. What role does Catherine Zeta-Jones play in the movie?
Well this Boy Scout meeting is at 9 am apparently, so unless it ends early I will miss the movie marathon. I could come at 11 or 12 if all works out?
What time are you going?
And I don't mean miss the whole movie marathon, but I mean one or two movies.
What time does it start
She is the love interest? She is a flight attendant who meets him
It's not too great a movie but it's cute and all
The movie sure grossed a lot of money but didn't do so well with the critics. It just seems like such an odd movie for Steven Spielberg to direct since he usually does science fiction and history and action films.
Well it starts at 10:30 but I think they're going to watch 12 Years a Slave first, so if I come late it should be fine
Also where do you download your movies from?
Oh, I don't want to watch that again. 
Yes it is strange. It's like a small story, ya know? Like a cute little movie that would normally be indie but then tom hanks and Spielberg and John Williams came in
(12 years a slave that is, I already saw it)
Mm I used to use pirate bay but that is no longer an option
Kickass.so is what I used once but I don't like it much. 
Also this app called Miro for playing the movies once downloaded is gr8
I don't want to watch it again either, way too long. So maybe if my meeting finishes at 12 or earlier, we can meet up and go to Martha's? I'll have my mom give me money to pay for your gas on the way. 
I also used to use pirate bay. But I guess I'll use kickass.so? I really want to watch Cabaret and other movies while I'm at grandpa's.
Oh so maybe Reyna would like that movie haha.
Ok, it really shouldn't be much.
Yeah you should do it. 
Lol why would she like it
Finally Alex's dad is coming here to grandpa's to pick him up. It's been so long and I'm the one who has been watching him for the past week.
Well when I asked for the websites I was already on my way to grandpa's, so I didn't have time :(
Because she's really into those indie romance movies.
Did you eat anything interesting today
How have you managed to watch anything??
Yes- pea soup. You?
I usually put on a movie for him or make him food and then watch my movies. Also after we play with toys, I let him play for a while and I watch movies.
But after a while it gets really annoying to watch a 4 year old for hours and hours a day.
Never had pea soup, is it good? These Dijon mustard beef hotdogs...
It's really unfair to you.
Yes it's good, especially on a cold day. Those hotdogs sound gross?
I agree, but I can't complain or my mom would get upset. Anyway, I'm just relieved that he's gone now.
They're really bad... I had to put a bunch of ketchup to subdue the sour Dijon mustard chunks.
So I'm getting some work done now, but later would you want to meet up to watch Moonrise?
I can meet you wherever if you don't want to drive all the way out
Chunks!
Wait where would I be picking you up from? I thought your BS mwetingg?
eting
Oh for today you mean
I'm still pretty beat up from  nye, but text me when you are done, ok
Yes, chunks! :( it was awful.
Alright I'll let you know when I'm done
Maybe you can take a nap
Right now I'm watching rain man. Have you seen it
I have not, what is it about? And why did you decide to watch it?
It's about a guy and his severely autistic brother. I don't really know why. I hear it referenced a lot and it won best picture. 
“Ninety percent of Westerners have sexual problems. They are not aroused and most of them have relations with animals.”
“in Western societies 75 percent of children do not know their fathers and are raised by their mothers.
“Thirty-five percent of babies who are born in America are bastards,” 
“The growth of feminism in the West and the fact that 60 percent of Western women prefer to sleep with dogs rather than men is the result of the absence of hejab and the diminished threshold of women’s sexual arousal,”
Also I'm done haha
Sounds like Gilbert Grape!
The 35% figure seems somewhat possible
Not the rest tho
Maybe! He speaks though. He is brilliant! A savant
Sad to say, but I also thought the 35% statistic was possible. I just think those misconceptions are very ignorant, especially since they are being publicized by educated officials.
Oh yeah, the younger brother in Gilbert Grape still acts like a child :(
More like a toddler actually
On the image they have on Netflix he (Leo DiCaprio?) looks like a kid too
Yes, his character is only 18, but he doesn't cut his hair short and he is always dirty from playing outside.
Is that a good movie? I don't want to see it soon after this one, but eventually worth seeing?
It's a good movie if you're into those heartwarming family/love summer vacation stories.
I think DiCaprio was a phenomenal actor though
Isn't he always!
He's the fucking best
Why can't he win his Oscar yet :(
How are you feeling?
I do not know
He deserves so hard
I'm alright, how are you 
Honestly I'm tired, but not sleepy, but I don't want to go get dressed etc. plus I need to do laundry tonight. :(
But I will pick you up tomorrow morning? We can call, and if we would get there before the end of 12 years, we can do something in the mean time
Send me the recording about your mom?
  
lol
I'm fine, just took a shower and I'm reading for apush. I am a bit congested but my head doesn't hurt anymore.
That's okay! Don't worry about it.
Of course. I can send the address of the place I'll be at or if I'll be at grandpa's. But I will call you.
Friends challenges are fun!
Yes! I'm making another
At first I thought it was going to be a team thing
Ok great.  About the assess
Address
Did you finish seminar
No, I have a couple more pages to do. But I'm going to finish tomorrow and Sunday. I don't have much to do.
Diviya worries too much about that
Yeah I'm gonna start mine tomorrow night. It will be ok
What do you have to write?
History paper?
That one was hard
Still?!!
That one was really hard
Yes.. Only 1 per trimester
Do you just choose friends instead of random?
What was first trimester's about?
Yep!
Reagan and AIDS
Fuck! I messed it up and did a character game instead. I'm sorry.
And this trimester?
Why is AIDS so important to you of all things? Did someone you know die of AIDS?
This trimester I did grade inflation at universities. 
I do not know anyone who died of AIDS. Honestly I did the paper on it because I didn't need to do any research on it cos I already knew. But in general I don't know why. It's just an intersection of everything that's interesting to me- the 80's, Reagan, history, gay history, medicine, politics
It's just something I'm really passionate about. 
Were you arguing for or against grade inflation? Or was the essay just about how history impacted grade inflation?
As I've been doing my paper for Connolly's I come across a lot of the topics mentioned and I have found it interesting to me as well. But for some reason I am just fascinated with the Middle East, I guess in the way you are with AIDS and Reagan, and for no apparent reason.
Also just announced Diviya can't go tomorrow then didn't reply.
This new challenge was fun. Who else is going?
I don't know yet. But in general it is going to be against grade inflation as an issue
I need more lives to play, so it'll be 40 minutes bb :(
So far it's you, Reyna, Nathaniel, Martha, and me. Maybe Diviya if we ever hear from her.
Fuck!!
It expires in 23 min
Nvm
23 hours 
Lol that's 23 hours
Im dumb 
:)
How many coins you got
So the essays for history can basically be on whatever the fuck you want?
19!
How are you going to incorporate history into grade inflation???
Yeah, doesn't need to be historical. It's history of science. And social science counts. Basically anything goes
Oh
How many do you have?
Martha is getting really pissy
117
Why is she pissy and in what format are y'all chatting
Since Diviya can't go, she is considering cancelling
We have this group text
Why doesn't Diviya get her shit together and say yes for our sake
I have seen over 80 films since the graduate. Wow
The Graduate is the first movie on my watch list! So every movie after that --minus movies that I've seen before I started using the watchlist -- I've seen since.
Second movie is Omar. So long ago... Good memories.
I only have so little coins because I used a bunch during games hahah.
Idk she's being weird. I think it's something to do with either her relationship or Martha's newfound morality.
I do not understand their relationship
Lol you been killin it
I have had ridiculously hard questions too tho
I'm watching Midnight Cowboy
Dustin Hoffman <3
"Is it overreacting to think Diviya might be mad at me? I snapchatted her and she opened it and never responded, and I texted her last night and she also didn't respond, and now she's saying she can't come tomorrow :(" 
Awwww Martha
To be quite frank with you I don't either. He is like a little lamb and obsessed with sports and slightly homophobic. I don't not only understand the appeal but the dynamic.
What do they even talk about?! He doesn't care about the news. Idk. Just very strange to me.
Oh... I meant Martha and Diviya
I like Nate
Lol you're just going through all those Dustin Hoffman movies, huh? What's next? Tootsie.
I like him too, but I'm allowed to question things.
Nah, it's just also on my list.
Mmhm damage control
Hahah I swear.
Though I do want to see tootsie..
Might add that to list 4. It still needs a lot
And I'm only 5 movies away from starting it so it needs to grow
Can I give you some movies I really want to see?
Sure. Though I will use my discretion this time lol so I don't watch bachelorette again
:)
Hahahah I'll recommend to you critically acclaimed movies this time that are on my list
Or really interesting films
Just a second
OMG JESSICA LANGE IS IN TOOTSIE I NEED TO SEE IT
Who
Prefer interesting over acclaimed
She was in King Kong, Big Fish, and American Horror Story
Here's my list for you: 
- Carmen Jones (1954)
- Mommy (2014)
- Amira and Sam (2014) also middle eastern so idk
- Ida (2013)
- Inside Job (2010) documentary, 
- Waltz with Bashir (2008)
- Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954 and preferably when you're high)
Diviya and I thought the last one was especially aesthetically pleasing 
Also you should probably watch Valley of the Dolls
Ok I will check them out
What's Midnight Cowboy about?
Any of those you recommend most? 
Midnight cowboy is about a male prostitute and his friend. It won best picture too. Not sure what the plot is yet
Well Ida, Mommy, and Waltz with Bashir look promising. 
Gary cooper mmmm
I was going to send some text about my phone call with Martha just now, but I think it's so funny how an opened snapchat with no response is so problematic.
Anyway, Martha is just really sad.
Why is she so sad
He is gorgeous oh my
I think it's nothing
Look at that cowlick in the first pic
I think I should focus more on older movies and actors. 
I just think that many older movies (before 1965) are too ordinary in content
Like sitcoms ya know
Pretty much because Diviya opened her snapchat and didn't reply, didn't reply to her text, and told us she couldn't come but didn't give any reason.
Hellcats hahah. It really did feel like a sitcom, partly due to the length.
Or maybe div is really working seriously now?
I mean that is a good explanation I think
What movie were you watching with Gary Cooper?
Yeah, Diviya told me she's been working all day. Martha was being silly.
None. They referenced him in Midnight Cowboy.
Did you reassure her
Holy shit so orientation tomorrow is apparently from 9am-2pm, but my mom told me not to worry bc they always end earlier, which is true. But either way, Martha moved it to 12:30 for Madeleine and Nathaniel, and they're still starting with 12 Years a Slave lol.
Shit that's so late
I know!!! We'll probably only get through two movies.
I did reassure her and I had Diviya text the group.
Maybe we can watch moonrise while they watch 12 years if we get there early
Well maybe you can ditch and say you are busy. I bet it won't end before 1..
One time they said orientation from 9-12 and ended it at 9:15 lol. I walked in and they said I could go.
Lol wtf
I'll find a way to make it work haha. But I'm saying if it does end at 2, it wouldn't be a problem since they're still starting with 12 years.
And if it does end at 12, we can watch moonrise kingdom in the other room while they watch 12 years
Bc it's for extra credit
It works out for us either way
Alright, cool. I just don't want to start my social day at 2pm, but I understand
What do you mean? Why is that?
Now Nathaniel can't go
This is why arranging this is stressful
Well, it's just late in the day to start a movie thing ya know 
Why can't he go
We had planned it a week ago! But yeah I understand. Idk what I'll do if it doesn't end up happening.
Reyna probably won't go.
He doesn't have a ride.
Does he live on the east side
Yes he does
Then it's on everyone's way
Ok I let him know. How's Midnight Cowboy?
Nathaniel said he would be able to go around 2
How did you get all 12 wtf
Martha cancelled
:(
Midnight cowboy is fine but I'm not far in
So we're going to watch movies on our own and discuss them over a group chat lol
R u efucken kidden m
It sounded really great to watch moonrise at her house
Fuck
You beat me by one second!
Are you fucking kidding me
Omg ok so we might just turn it into a sleepover! Which is even better
Heck yes
I want that so much
It would be the best thing ever. I'll update you <3
Ok
Martha's concerns:
Ok obviously I won't bring anything if that is on the list
Of concerns
- not getting enough sleep
- sleeping in the living rooms (which I don't think any of us mind) because her grandparents are home
Lol it was on Madeleine's list
- legit concern
-don't care
Would you want to host a movie night?
I guess.... Not really 
Bc it's closer to z mansion for the girls and Nate
Oh
Mm I guess
I would prefer not, I don't have a large TV even
Plus I don't want to watch 12 years
Well the other movies on the list are The Color Purple and Schindler's List
Maybe this is dumb but what about going to her during the day and then sleeping at mine? Most of them live near me anyway so it's not extra gas
Fuck I've seen the latter too
And I never want to see it again
But it's ok I have my laptop
Martha's is just far for everyone especially Reyna
But that's alright, I think the plan is dying down.
The whole chalupa?
Well you were the last hope lol but don't worry
Because they need to be at Z mansion at 7
And they'd have to get up super early from Martha's 
*wake up from Martha's at 7
Oh ok
That's not even that early but ok
Lol now Martha says she doesn't even want a sleepover and likes her own bed.
Ok well it's all good.
Martha is all over the place
do you just not to host at your house ever again?
Maybe if there's a good reason, but not particularly
I would do a movie night
But not now
Not on such notice
What if it was just you me and Diviya
I would do it
Or if it was us and her and Nate
Or reyna
Lol wtf
I asked Diviya and she said "why don't you just do date night"
:(
Not that I don't want to do date night
But if we are at my house I prefer to have more than just us so:
1. Mom don't bother me bout it
2. We actually watch movies........
Diviya told me she'll come but she won't spend the night and I should
She said it's better like that
I actually want to watch movies too! I wasn't expecting to do anything if we went to Martha's or whatever
They want to know what time (her and Nate)
Wait he would come too?
That's gr8
Yes
N8
So do I say 5:30/6?
Well I suppose whenever you finish
I was thinking way earlier to
Or 4:30?
Yo
Because if they leave at like 10
We can do 2:30
Is that ok
Is 2:30 ok?
Yeah I'll be done with my meeting by then
Ok. Tell div I can pick her up?
Does Nate have a ride
I think Nate will but probably not Diviya 
Also hahahah that's N8.
Ok
Gr8
M8
Wasn't that hard
It was so hard wtf all the football
And that Tom Hanks movie and the dates that were too close to one another
Oh man
That was bad
I have learned that its always either Peyton Manning or Tom Brady if those are options
Exactly! And Lebron or Jordan for basketball. 
There was that one emmit question lol and I got it right.
I saw that one and I was dunno so I picked the whitest name
You went so fast
Did you not want to lose on time
Actually I thought that you answered it first
And that it went by turns
???
But it timed you on how long it takes to complete and how many you got right
Yep
Like I didn't know we could both do it at the same time
You going to sleep now?
M8
Yap
I am 1/2 through MC
And it is not very interesting!!
So I will sleep
Good nach
I'm reading Dorian Gray and he sounds so lovely
Good night habibi ❤️
Hasta mañana pasta
I love how Wilde makes each moment so vivid and clear. The imagery is superb.
Hi
Yep he is great like that
Especially flowers
Yes!!!! Flowers and Lord Henry and gestures and expressions
Lord Henry
Fuck, everything that man says
My mom asked if I'm dating anybody and I kept denying but now she knows
Is ridiculous
She's telling me you're going to dominate me and have sex with me
And you have a strong personality
I know haha he just goes on and on about everything
Upi6 is up!
That was awfully embarrassing. And alright I'll play soon!
Yeah.. Is everything ok? I don't care to know the details of the conversation
Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy is a lot like Reza
Yeah she just said I can't sleep over :( but she's ok with us being together
Haha so really annoying and vulgar?
Strange, but present, moral character
Are they actually Cowboys?
Well, no. As the guy frequently says, "Now, I ain't a real cowboy but I am a stud"
."
Do you know why that's the name of the movie? 
Midnight Cowboy is rated X, but I think now it would be PG-13, or a light R. It is strange
I was thinking it was a club he worked at or something and was a prostitute there
No
Maybes because he tries to use his cowboy shtick to get business, like at midnight? Not sure
Oh so is it gay prostitution?
What do they show that makes it X worthy? Do you see Dustin Hoffman with it all off?!!
No, mostly straight
And no. He is very sick. In fact it is implied he is a virgin
They said it was for drugs and nudity? They smoked a blunt, and there was only frontal nudity of a woman
Just boobs
What's up at meeting
Do we still have to watch 12 years, color purple and Schindler with them
Can we pick other movies
The meeting is awful and so boring
I'm just sitting here listening to presentations I've heard many times before or presentations I've given in the past
No! We can watch anything of historical significance 
He's sick???
I won flarp though
We can watch moonrise while they watch 12 years and then they can pick other historical movies
She also recommended PBS movies
Lol those aren't even movies
Isn't the extra credit capped at 1?
Like you won't get bonus for watching 15 historical movies
What is flare
Flarp
Nope! Capped at 4 movies I think, and 5 movies if you got a letter home
How many have you guys seen
We haven't seen any. We were planning on watching them all today haha
Shit
Ok let me choose them at least
I think Diviya's seen the Color Purple though?
Or have some inpt
Input
Ok
Yeah just choose some good historical movies
Well we want to watch shorter movies
Not feckin 3 hours
Looking at you, Schindler
Billings approved though
And 12 Years like damn
Of course
All the President's n
The Great dictator? (Hitler farse, somewhat historical)
I really want to watch birth of a nation and she would give you super bonus points but it is so long
It alone caused the resurgence of the KKK
Zero Dark 30? Argo?
Oh yes anything to do with civil rights or KKK or reconstruction or civil war she would love
But that is, again, over 3 hours and from 1915!
Well Zero Dark 30 is more recent
I think movies about things that happened in the 1700s-1900
Lol Selma
OMG THEY ARE REMAKING BENHUR
I am so excited
A mustard?
Amistad...
What is the strict guideline?
Ok now Martha says it's back on and we can come over.....
What
Wtf
Ok
I'm good w that
I can still pick up div
And Nate if he lives somewhat on the way
Tell them that?
Lol alright then. So confusing gosh
So idk if Nate is going or not
Ok
So Diviya said its ok if you pick her up around 2:30. Could you get me from grandpa's after?
And she also wants to know if you could take her home
Yep and yap
And Nathaniel wants a ride too lol
If he could be definitive that would be gr8
What is his address
Hey what about
Gone with the wind or Django
For us to watch
1815 south avenida planeta 
OMG!!! Gone with the wind holy shit
Django is too inappropriate
Also what time are you coming for all of us? I feel really bad that you have to do so much driving :(
I planned on picking you up at 230, Diviya 215
Nate whenever I get there
I'm wearing baby underwear 
???
I think you can get Nathaniel first and it would be fine
Didn't have clean underwear bc didn't pack
Ok
Haven't left div's yet...
How does baby underwear fit you
Is your brother just fat
Jk
lol is she taking too long
Yes but I was late too
I don't know! It was tight at first but it looks sooo good
Ok then you can get me before Nate
But if I was on time she would be 15 min late
Ok
Brother is so fat. I didn't think it would fit
My balls are being squeezed right now
Go commando
Good idea actually 
"Remember do not allow anyone to talk down on you with degrading words & foul language - YOU deserve better & most respect" 
-mom
:(
You're a dick
:)
Can't make your mom a liar eh
It's only bc she read our texts but I don't think she knows we joke around when we call each other bitch and stuff...
"GOD bless you"
Hi
Are you going to sleep soon
Possibly. How are you
I'm alright. It's really bad with my brothers though...
Anyway it doesn't matter
How are you feeling
Aimee ok I want to talk to you
As upset as I am with my mom all the time I don't know who I would have or what I would do without her
And it really frightens me
Because I only have my grandpa and he's not able to support me for much longer
I'm just really sad
I think you need to talk to her in the morning, and tell her that you need to know what's going on and then address these concerns. You deserve to know what's going on, and it's just going to drive you crazy not knowing
I'm really sorry :(
It's so fucking unreasonable for her not to tell me!!! I feel like I have such a huge responsibility because it's basically me taking care of her children while she pays the bills, dammit. 
It's fine, thank you
Like right now I'm putting my baby brother to sleep which I have done innumerable times this week
And if something's going to happen I need to know, you're right
Thank you so much for taking me to the hospital though. It didn't mean much to me until I was with her in the room.
I'm really glad she encouraged you to go see her
If only to drop things off
Well, having to take care of them is mostly because of break, no?
I mean not that much while there is school
Well it's mainly on weekends (Fri-Sun) and on days she works midnight shift for DEA. Not during the weekend as much but it's still stressful.
Because it's more than just putting him to sleep and cooking for him
I think you need to talk to her about that
And how it's unfair to you
And how you need that time for yourself, because you do. You have enough stress from school
Not now obviously
That's all true, and especially stressful during the upcoming months and with AP season. 
Anyway, thank you. I really appreciate all that you do for me.
You mean so much to me
Did you finish Westside Story
:) 
No I'm like 25 min left
What are you doing 
Trying to put the wild child to sleep. Richie came in here earlier for a charger and started kicking me, causing Alex to cry.
And I won a Trivia Crack round against Reyna! Took a day and a half haha
Wbu? Finishing the movie?
:(. Richie is a dick
How much did you win by
Yep
Oooooh good job winning that one
I used like 20 coins
6-4
You can use coins on challenges????
Curvy ballerina
Mmm
That is curvy
Not fat
Curvy
She has a really tight core and her thigh is all muscle
She's not fat...
Are you calling me out on my word choice
No 
It's just that
Many people say curvy to mean fat, and you demonstrated what curvy is perfectly
Oh yeah, that bothers me when people do that. Like Zoe....
She would say she wasn't fat but curvy
I think there is a distinct difference between the two 
African Americans tend to be curvy
But ok Zoe wasn't really fat tho
They do
Well I don't think she was the most fit either
Did you find her brother attractive or was it just me
He was hot
Sure but I think she was curvy? She had big hips and boobs and small waist
Yeah I guess I just forgot about her waist
Do you ever think about your previous relationships and does it ever sadden you
Mm
Not really. Friendships sure, relationships not really. I used to be embarrassed about some fuck ups but not now. You are?
Not in a long time. At first I used to think about it all the time and compare this to those ones, but it felt inappropriate and wrong. Occasionally when you bring up Shawn's name I think about other things, like sexual activities or how you liked him, but not our relationship. I also used to think about fuck ups.
I guess the only people I think about are Anna Maria and Audrey and Priscilla
Why Audrey?
Do you not want me to mention him
Look at this frozen solid frog! He froze while looking for a mate on a Norwegian lake.
Her whole family situation makes me feel awful... So I'm nice to her and talk to her.
And I think she's a nice person despite how ridiculous her stories were
I don't mind hahah, but it's funny to think about how different he is now.
What is wrong with her family
Poor frog
It would be scary if he is the same now as then, he was a dealer then, and is still emotional AF 
Very low-income and there were sure signs of abuse... Like she had lots of bruises, then she would tell us and one person would say it wasn't true and then she would burst out crying.
So you're saying he hasn't changed much or what? He seems worse now than before?
Why did she move?
I'm saying how do you know he has changed? He is so private, or rather changes his tune with his surroundings. It is hard to tell how he is.
She moved so that her dad could find a better job and apparently that was in Wisconsin. 
Well I guess I'm talking about the change from when we were together to after. After we broke up he wasn't on honor roll anymore and was a dealer. It's just interesting.
Oh. Well I'm going to sleep, hope all is well, good night!!
Goodnight love 💕
Yo
What up
I had such a weird dream about you. First we were watching movies and doing butt stuff
Then all of a sudden a group was at my grandpa's house playing evil apples in one room and trivia crack in another
And I almost killed you over it
But I just woke up
What's up with you
You would kill me over trivia crack?
Jk
Well, I NEED to work on paper but really don't want to
I think I should start at 10 or 1030 but might set it to 12
I really don't wanna do it
I had a dream that said I needed to get amazon prime
Also mr Mathews smoked me out
And I went camping w my dad
(Separate dreams)
I've been thinking so much about butt stuff since NYE it's ridiculous.
You should start it after you've eaten and everything, so 10:30-12 sounds fine. As long as you're productive.
Lol apparently Mathews actually does smoke pot, so that's funny
Why have you been thinking about butt stuff? Your butt? 
Yes I knew that lol
Well after we decided not to bc it would be in a car, but I really really do. Honestly I want to do it when we're both prepared and in a bed and relaxed. I just want to feel safe and secure, if you understand?
You think Mathews is gay/bi too?
I think so
Wait though whose but
Butt
No I don't think he is
How is everything with your mom? Have you talked to her 
Mine... But I want you to go slow and be careful and use lube. It's just really concerning for me.
Ok!
I have not talked to her. Grandpa tried calling but she didn't answer so she's probably asleep
No Aimee but I really do want to feel comfortable with this idk how to stress that enough
I understand that
Sometimes I feel like inviting you to grandpa's when mom isn't home bc of all the spare rooms he has but idk
Like he wouldn't check on me or anything but it's risky
If you say your name's Emmett it would be ok
I don't think that's a safe environment
I mean if that's the goal
Well then your house some time?
Or where
Yeah
I thought you were really paranoid about your mom
I mean I am
What does your dad think about all of this
Does he ever ask you about your relationships or anything
Was he more accepting than mom
He doesn't ask
What are you doing now
I guess that's good sometimes then
Reading Dorian Gray, except I need to eat!
Wbu? Writing?
Omg that challenge I'm such an idiot. I wasn't even thinking damn
I will start at 12
I ate a sandwich
Upi12 is up
Upi
What happened on upi 10
Well my grandpa was walking over to ask what I wanted for breakfast lol so I tried to hurry and I wasn't paying attention 
Nate and I had such a good game. We were up until 2 playing and it kept going back and forth with challenges
No mas vidas :(
I'm still in bed since I feel sick, so idk if I'm going to do homework because I might not go to school tomorrow
Upi sandwich. What kind of sandwich
Did you know that Walt Disney has never showed an animal being killed and never will show an animal being killed in any of his films because he accidentally killed an owl as a child
Bambi?
Only the shadow, but you never see the actual scene
Did you beat Nate
He only beat me bc he got that sports character. Damn straight boys.
Anyway, good luck on your paper! Hopefully you are productive.
Sorry I spaced. Thanks
Hi
I'm taking a break
Now I have 3.5 pages
But I don't know where to go from here
Oh well
Hi I'm watching The Phantom of the Opera, 2004 version
Despite the harsh reviews it received, I really like it...
That's really good. It takes me about an hour to do one page lol.
How many pages does it need to be?
It got good imdb eating
Well I already had almost 2 pages so it's not too fast
It needs to be 10
So a lot more
It also got nominated for some Oscars and won one I think
Ohhhh ok. Is the rough draft due soon?
The sets are really beautiful
No. The final is due tomorrow..
I have it on DVD but haven't yet watched it. Might be a good addition
I don't operate like Diviya and Martha at all. I guess it's not so obvious this year when I have so little work but I operate best when I'm under time pressure
In fact I really can't get anything done if its not due in the near future
If I had to watch 4 movies for APUSH I would pull an all nighter and start at 11PM
Oh shit! I had no idea bc I thought it was due at the end of the 2nd trimester.
So my mom is going to be in the hospital for a few more days... There's something wrong with her heart.
It is a good addition! You should watch it sometime.
Do they know what is wrong?
Yeah I also procrastinate really hard too. I wait until the day before to do almost everything.
And it's when I'm the most productive 
That sounds like relatively good news? Heart issues at such a young age are usually very treatable, I'm lead to believe
Well she might have to get heart stent surgery.
That's not risky though! :)
You don't know what the underlying condition is? 
Sorry I'm being invasive. Feel free to not answer
I don't mind if you're being invasive haha. Unfortunately though, I don't. She only tells my grandpa things and that was all he said.
Listen to old man willow? That's what the end of midnight cowboy is. It's all trippy, the feel of the song
Don't have to listen to all of it
Or any of it actually
But it's very long 
Oh, I was going to listen right now! My brothers are just freaking out because mom called.
Lol the band looks really hippyish 
I really like it
Do you ever hold your breath during movies when characters go underwater 
Mm I don't really do that?
What did she say
I used to do that as a child. Almost passed out during Nemo
Jk lol. But I really did do that
Was gonna say
You were dumb
She wanted to talk to my brothers and then told me to get along with them and cooperate
Hahahahah
5.5 pages. I'm really out of shit to say
Yep so that's a great way to get libertarians on the side of republicans /sarcasm
Ok but she's legitimately unintelligent
"I have never smoked
Pot before. Not all libertarians are stoners"
I've always just wanted to read one of her books to see what goes through her head. I saw her on The View talking about one of her books and racism and she is such an idiot oh my gosh.
I also don't like Michele Bachmann on media. She just avoids all the questions and tries to give a picture perfect idea about republicans and how democrats are wrong with no compromise.
I just thought that sentence was funny. But the girl in green echoed my belief
She's a really dumb shit Michelle bachman
I loved that comment about the hypothetical "if we didn't live in a socialist society" would it still matter? Yet she refused to answer 
The republicans will not capture the hearts of the young until they stop giving the time of day to unintelligent people
They're just really disjointed
Also, I watched a TED talk today about how 100 years ago the average IQ was 70 because people didn't have use for abstract and logical thinking and didn't teach it or emphasize it and I wonder how much that is still relevant to the older generations now that supports the Republican Party and seems anti-logic at times!
Ann coulter kinda looks like a drag queen
And she's 6 foot
And she's a total bitch
Would not be surprised if she was trolling us all and was a drag queen
Well obviously it's much more than just the anti-logic because of the households they were raised in, religion, etc. I just think that the GOP has some really good points and views on certain things but it's these dumb fucks who represent them with their über religious ideals attached to everything they believe that really repulsed people.
That's really interesting though, I never knew that. You should send link
Lol I wouldn't be surprised if Ann Coulter is trolling us about everything.
See, religion is changing. It is less popular now because people are not willing to accept a lack of logic. There is nothing logical to say god does not exist, but to say that the world is 6000 years old will not be accepted. Add that to the anti-progressive social values that religions seem keen to hold close to their core instead of focusing on belief. 
Well, Mitt Romney was not a dumb fuck. I think it's the liberal media also that promotes the image of a few dumb republicans, but for some reason Fox gives them airtime. Also Sarah Palin was an incredibly dumb choice.
I'll find the link
Or rather attitudes towards religion*
You can be religious and progressive but we make everything into a package deal now. Anti-war, pro-welfare, atheism and gay marriage don't need to go together
Yes, I agree. I thought that the allegations against Romney were absolute nonsense and had little to do with his views. Like what, he had a dog on the roof of his car or something during college? I don't really remember, but the party system is just polarizing us and media isn't helping. 
We actually talked about the package thing in APUSH once and all agreed how upset we were that there isn't one candidate to represent all of our views and there never will be.
And someone said we could abolish the party system and do a majority vote for every single matter lol.
Well
The fundamental issue
Is that the average American is a dipshit
And we can't change that :P
Majority vote, even if feasible, is dumb. Tyranny of the Majority. The Founding Fathers knew this- hence we have representatives. 
Basically, people are fucking stupid. But also they don't have time to care about all the issues and be well-informed. And even well-informed people make (what we would consider) dumb decisions
Humans are driven towards instant gratifications, not long term vision, which is necessary in politics
Okay yes sorry I fell asleep
:(
Yeah and it's funny to see how educated the people we criticize the most are. Like Ann Coulter went to Cornell and law school.
They're all pretty well-informed though.
😘😘😘
I watched this Michele Bachmann video on Israel earlier and of course she is pro-Israel, but what I found strange is how she said that she needed Judaism and that she is grateful for the existence of her religion because of Judaism and how she grew up loving Jews.
She even threw in a little Bible quote about Moses and the Sermon on the Mount
Or perhaps she just mentioned it
Lol I was just reading about Cornell. They wanted to curb grade inflation so they posted all the average grades of each course, but it made it way worse cos everyone took the classes with higher average grades
Bitch all bible quotes are big
Word of G-D!
Oh shit. There goes an acceptance letter for medical school to an undeserving kid with a 4.0 because he took all the easy classes whereas the 3.2 who specialized won't get in.
My dad made pasta and when he put it in the water bugs came out
Capital H-I-M
Hahah that's so gross. When I went on Boy Scout camp outs and bugs flew into the food that was cooking, the adults still made us eat it because it was "protein", as if it was even a sufficient amount of protein.
Well, I wrote this paper and as it turns out that's not really accurate. Princeton deflated their grades a lot (~50% A's to a max of 35%), and nothing bad happened to the students. At top institutions everyone does fine because of the name, and at less rigorous places if you try it's quite easy. So really it's not a big deal. Plus 80% of their students took advantage of it so its not exactly a cheating few... 
"Protein" more like "let me enforce my dumb standards of masculinity on you"
Does that sound like a
Tumblrina thing to say? I wonder if I sound like one now. At least I'm not as bad as div
Omg I was just about to say "Well, well Mr. Rajesh" hahah
But you beat me to it
Lol I like that final touch, that her man will adopt her name. So feminist
Amelia Earhart made her hub take her name and forced it to be an open marriage
She seemed upset that the extra credit was due next week instead of today. Seemed like a complete accident.
Ok idk if my text messages sent or not
They did but as the other number?
Found at a restroom at a large gas station/food place on the way
Why is pretty before woman? Must a woman be pretty? What about pretty boys hmm
Why must women even be called women? Why can't we all just be humans with boobs or human with dicks?
Why segregate the humans
That's cissexist bitch
Why can't we all just be humans
And just keep that to ourselves unless we have consensual sex which may or may not consist of genitals or physical contact
Didn't you hear? It consists of licking elbows and ears.
We have no right to violate anybody's body other than those three places.
Four
Unless you're missing an ear
Good call, that was almost ableist
But I have no elbows
My arms just jiggle ya know
Cos I have a few extra pounds here and there, like 400 of my closest buddies. 
#nofatshaming #bodypositive #health
There was some new form of sex with the brain but we need to keep in mind people with Down's syndrome or Alzheimer's 
I think the doc is not used to normal weight patients cos he commented that I was thin and thus an easy case like 5 times
How do you say normal weight without implying fat is not normal?
I am having sex with my brain right now
I think and then electrical signals penetrate my neurons
But it could be sex even if it didn't penetrate them
Or even if the electricity was on a Skype call
Or if it was another neuron! Same-cell marriage!
My drunken note from the Veris party when I went crazy: "Alcohol compainsiomfhip championship
We can type 10% well it's bam bans
 I love me I love her I love love low epic e 
Wowoowowowowo
I love the world"
That's great! Did he talk about scarring or the aesthetic of it?
Lol I was reading those as my grandpa was telling me that if my mom died my life would be different and I felt terrible for laughing
Maybe I too should keep a collection of drunken notes
I have drunken text messages if that counts
Oh goodness, that fucking poem
YOU told me to read it then. I was going to wait until midnight but you kept on insisting.
YOU insisted on reading it drunk
Lets not recap this event
Send the drunk texts?
Lol after I read it: "sooo..... Does this mean you're breaking up with me?"
Ok tbh that's what it sounded like but I was also high AFFFF
He said I have great pecs which will help him out, and make it look better. He said he believes it will be a really good result. 
Scarring is scarring though.
If I woke up at 604 instead of 603 my life would be different
I sent multiple I love you's to Zayna and Bella. I've texted Anthony that alcohol makes me want to pee.
And on New Year's Eve I told Anna Maria that I love her and that I miss talking to her and that I will never forget her
And that I'm a little drunk right now
Did Anthony answe you
Answer
Yeah he did
He told me to go pee lol
Lol
Did you
Did he ask if you had been exercising?
Nope
I don't even think I had to go pee... I'm not sure.
Oh and I send so many drunk snaps
Tess's
Yesss*
OMG never gonna let go of the bong pic you sent to... Was it Tess?
Drunk snaps are guiltless unless someone screenshots it
Then the bong pic is also guiltless because Tess just replied "ayyyy" or "niceeee" or something stupid
That was hilarious
Mmn 
It was kinda hilarious tho
Shannon sat with us during lunch today and she was telling us how her and Armando had sex at a park
Then a police officer shined his flashlight on the back window and started yelling at them to get out
So she was trying to put her clothes back on but he kept yelling and yelling 
That's horribly awkward
So she just went out topless and then he said "no!!! Get back in there and put clothes on"
Hahahahahja 
It was the funniest thing I started crying from laughing
I like the way Shannon tells stories
Basically a Diviya but with a Shannon twist
"With a Shannon twist"
And Shannon was naked
Shannon sounds like such a bitch name

So does this but flatter boobs
"Ezekiel or something"
Oh god
I was legit a bit hurt
But I think he was just really out 
That your mom would tell?
No
That he was like well even if you did want to go by it I wouldn't use
I just didn't think it was right for him to bring that up regardless
I agree
I remember saying "wowww that's so offensive"
I was out too
OMG and fucking jay
But he was a trainwreck
Did you blackout? How much did you even take I didn't see you take much at all
When have you seen his dick???
Sorry man
I did not blackout, never have. Although I remember taking many many shots on my own
I'm gonna pull a Shawn on this one
And Xóchitl started crying when I took one
Lol no that only counts when describing what it looks like
You don't remember humping the wall
Therefore you have to tell
In model in
UN he changed in a very conspicuous place
Like literally facing us all and didn't say anything
It's ok tho
You wanted to look though didn't you 
Don't even deny it
No
Stop
No I really didn't
I'm not just a dick monster or perv god
Perv, god
Not pervgod
I got the message without the comma but hey 
I can't help it
Literally I have my sex drive more under control than you by far
I don't know why I'm the whore here
You literally told me that you sat behind Jacob Gabbitas and he stood up and you were staring at his ass
This was like a month ago
That's different by a lot from looking at a guy's junk while he changed
Ass is public property
If I asked to have sex pretty much anywhere you would probably agree
I only saw Jay's because I didn't know if he was wearing underwear or not
Not true! Name 5 bizarre places and I'll give honest answers
Desert
Park at night in dark (not car)
A clean bathroom to a nice and large business
Graduation, like if we locked one of the changing rooms
In my car in a quiet part of the school parking lot at lunch (where no one walks by)
Those are so good!
Also did you know that James Boehm and Danielle Macias had sex on the school stairs
Shannon told me that today
Under what circumstances
Did they do that
Well because they were allowed to stay the night for the senior prank
Is that a yes to all 5
Lol nice
Nope!
Mmhm horn dog
My only objection is public bathrooms
But wow we need to do these
No see
I don't want to do these they were suggestions to show that you are a whore...
You wouldn't do any of them huh
Oh yeah knew it
Except desert. Desert would be fun
You're evil
:)
Graduation actually sounded fun
I think I would do that one too actually
That's a story ya know
Please tell
No I mean it would be a story
Ohhhhhh yeah it would be
For the grandkids
Well we should have done it last year ugh
Jk that was a bad time
Didn't you send me on a gum run?
I think so
Lol going out with a BABG
Bang..
No!!!
With a BABG sounds better
More intense
Lolllll
Ok b I need to go to sleep :/ good convo
I wish you the best of luck for tomorrow
Good night and probably by the next time we really speak I will be 5 lbs lighter
❤️❤️❤️
Hahahahah good night :)
How are you???
Ow
But ok
Though the apartment is very pretty
Minimalist and very French, great view great porch not that I can see from bed lol
Febrewery
:DD
How are you feeling though? Are you satisfied?
How did you feel after
What's the apartment called?
I cannot see it for 6 days it is all gauzed to hell. It is so gauzed that it looks like I have big boobs when I wear a shirt
I felt ok, just do not want to move
It's not like an apartment complex, it's just a duplex, attached to another one in a neighborhood of large houses. I think it was a house that was converted into two apartments to rent out
Lol if mom secretly got me a breast augmentation and knew I wouldn't read the paperwork
This painkiller is very effective I have no pain now, as long as I do not move
Sergio you are so supportive of me every day with everything that I do and I appreciate that so much. 
Hi! Sorry, just finished our global meeting. We watched this strange Guatemalan short film called The Garden of Steven about a missionary who eventually gives up the cause for alcohol. 
As I read the big boobs thing I was thinking about the augmentation hahah.
And then you said that so you basically read my mind.
:)
At least you'll get to watch a bunch of movies and be lazy all day. Lucky you.
My mom spoke to the surgeon and he seemed very satisfied with the result, so that's good. 
Lol if I get the attention span
Right now I'm in and out of sleep because I don't have energy
Not cos I'm actually sleepy
Do you recommend the short
Film
I was literally about to ask if you had been taking naps.
How long are you staying in that duplex?
No, there isn't really any cultural significance in the movie because the people act how you would expect any others to be if a missionary was trying to convert others.
It's just super strange
we will be here for a week!
Oh, how did you guys choose it 
Oh my goodness that sounds absolutely awful. A whole entire week in bed. Do you have physical therapy?
Lol well I chose it during APUSH this morning without reading the synopsis.
Well I can move around, I can walk even now as much as I want. We can even go out, I just don't want to. They said I could drive tomorrow..
Oh it's on Netflix?
Ew
Though I will not drive! It is crazy here plus we took my dad's car
Yeah, where would you even drive to? Maybe sightseeing haha. 
But that's wonderful! :) I'm really really glad that everything turned out fine
Super relieved
There's actually this website dedicated to short films that we always use. 
It has almost every country.
So no, it is not on Netflix.
Idk just to hang our, restaurants, shopping at uniqlo lol. Visit colleges, not that I can apply anymore
Rate your day on a fruit scale. From your least favorite fruit to your favorite fruit. For me, it would be from like orange or cranberry to persimmon
Making dinner :)
It looks picturesque
I am probably goings to sleep
Might wake up later will text
Oh I thought uniqlo was in Korea?
Japan, and it has a couple stores in the US, at least 2 (one in SF and NYC) but might have opened more in the last two years
My day went from a raisin to a pineapple and then to an orange
Do you like oranges and cranberries?
I hate eating oranges and cranberries but like products of them
Do you like those fruits
I hate oranges and raisins but love pineapple. Cranberries are so good though.
Anyway, go to sleep :)
This place is so rich that there is a mazerati, Ferrari, and tesla dealership that I saw
 
Ay
Is that your view from the apartment?! How scenic.
How was your hair?
Omg I meant how was your day. Words from the conversation accidentally made their way into that text lol.
Somebody said hair.
Yep that was the dawn view
So I couldn't really sleep last night, only like 30
Min at a time and then not able to go back, but too exhausted to watch a movie or something so I just lay there.
This morning I got some benadryl to control the itching and it made me so drowsy so I napped all day except to eat
Wbu?
I lose and regain my voice continually
Apparently related to the breathing tube I had while under? I didn't know I had a breathing tube
:( I'm sorry, that sounds awful. Do you think it's the painkillers?
Oh the Benadryl
I had a great day! Shannon has been eating lunch with us recently and today Erica and sienna joined us.
Had a debate in language about walden
Saw Mr. Ramirez and a bunch of graduates from years ago and last year
In seminar we played with this interactive timeline program called Gapminder, you should look it up.
Have you ever had laughing gas lol? I remember once I did and I got to choose the scent.
And Diviya got me Doritos I am forever grateful 
I have gap minder!! I found it on a school computer years ago and was enchanted
It is so cool
Never had laughing had
Gas
Lol for you air is practically laughing gas
How was the lunch conversation
It is the coolest thing I'm downloading it as soon as I can. Also we did wiki races which I feel like we should do sometime.
Lol I've laughed so much over the past week, I have many many stories to tell you
Any to share? I'm so bored
Shannon was teaching me some hebrew words she knew and I wrote some on her arm. We talked about a bunch of things idk
Ok so Bella, jay, and I were talking about how when you and Joseph and jay get together you're the worst and most condescending group ever
And how you guys argue over the dumbest shit
And Bella said that she had a recording of some drunken argument where you and jay were arguing over who was richer
Lol more like when we do that while drunk
Apparently the argument wasn't getting anywhere so you just stopped and said "naaah, nigga"
Normally it's Joseph and jay that argue dumb shit sober
It was hilarious 
Lol I totally said that
I lost my shit when I heard that
then in language we were talking about transcendentalism and how it makes us feel when we're in nature, and that abortion girl talia was like "as a photographer..."
Then Connolly cut her off and said only professionals said that
that was also really funny
Stories are no fun over text :(
Abortion girl talia what
I suppose 
But I insist on hearing the stories when I am back so you have to remember
I actually wrote them down
Also since everybody already knows thanks to Demi, leo and Zayna broke up
What happened
He was being super clingy and would constantly ask her why it was taking so long to reply (an hour)
How long have they been on the rocks? It seems that I stopped hearing sweet things about them fairly quickly
Well he's always been very clingy like refusing to let go of her hand and stuff
But during winter break she felt suffocated
He would text her nonstop while she was in DC
Oh, yes I understand 
It is difficult when people are out of town because there can quickly become nothing to talk about without shared stimulus 
We usually don't have that issue which is nice!
:)
Alex's face looks gross. I would not have expected that from some jumping castle accident lol. He looks like somebody beat him up.
What a lame story to tell
So unimpressive
Frankly, I find it so easy to talk to you
Really? I didn't see his face after lol.
Lol it's like how I have stitches from a water fun accident, but my baseball team said it was a sports accident to make it sound less lame
I have a cool basic game theory question for you
There are 3 guys in a three way duel. 
Mr black goes first, he has 33% accuracy.
Mr Grey goes second, he has 66% accuracy
Mr white goes third, he has 100% accuracy.
How should mr black shoot?
How is your mom
Haha a water fun accident? Please do tell
Gun*
Shoot himself
Or shoot three times
What's the answer?
She's fine! Will be out on Monday afternoon
God I should not be playing trivia crack I am so hopped up
OxyContin + Tylenol + benadryl + antibiotics (cephalexin)
The answer is he should shoot in the air, and then the next guy will try to shoot mr white
Basically buys him time 
That's great that she will be out soon
The water fun incident
A dumb kid in second grade put one of those foam covered water guns up to my chin and cocked it (like pull it back) and then pushed out and it ripped my chin skin a lot, but I didn't feel it much. Went in water, pool of blood, urgent care, ended up getting a good number of stitches. 
I deleted that app oh my goodness it was way too time consuming
Yeah I was thinking he could shoot away and that way it would show that he wasn't meaning any harm
Do you have much work this  weekend? 
I cannot believe it is already the weekend 
No, it's not that, they will try to shoot him anyway lol this is economics not psychology
But they will try to shoot those with more likelihood of killing them, AKA the other two people
So he doesn't want to kill one of the others because then the one left will only try to hit him
Oh my goodness. Speaking of pool stories, once when I was in 5th grade there was this girl named Brandie and we were playing footsies and kicking each other, and I accidentally got my big toe into her vagina
I have lots of work this weekend. Do you? Have you been emailing teachers?
No, I talked to them before I left. When I get back I will have to make up a bio quiz, work on history presentation, turn in an SRP syllabus, and start on a Spanish paper. Which sounds like a lot but all in all won't take more than an afternoon.
What do you have to do
Lol what did brandie (stripper name...) say?
Lol that would at least take me a whole day.
I have APUSH reading, bio problems, Chinese project, language reading, math set, seminar essay.
You know since I'm guaranteed an SRP with seminar, I want to go to the Middle East.
Like turkey or israel or Lebanon
I want to study something related to Islamophobia 
Or idk, it's just really interesting
I'm doing a project on Cholent 
And I'm making some!
Brandie swam away :( it was a sad moment
Islamophobia would be difficult to study in a Muslim country, more easy in Europe or Israel. Also, I would think it unsafe for you to go to an Islamic country... Unless you really really pounded out your feminine behavior, no offense at all, but I think you would be at risk. 
What cholent recipe are you using?
What do you mean guaranteed? How does that work with seminar?
Plus you would need to find a reputable advisor in the Middle East, plus parental and school agreement. Maybe Turkey, I suppose it's relatively stable, but less so with Recep Tayyip Erdogan
Maybe go there on your own after you graduate? The SRP requirements are so limiting, plus the school doesn't want liability, no one has ever went somewhere unstable like that
Then again Charlotte is kinda doing that maybe you could talk to her
It's kinda like how I wanted to do HIV for SRP. It's just very hard to get the right connections
When is all that work due
Yeah, my top choices were Israel and Turkey. Also that was one of my concerns, especially in Egypt, so that's why I would rather go to Israel. And for the seminar thing, we were told that next year our project counts for an SRP and that we would have access to international databases and resources so traveling is definitely an option. 
I'm using a vegetarian Cholent recipe because not everybody does meat
Emily went to Uganda...?
What's Charlotte doing? Also what do you mean an HIV thing? What would you do?
This is for next year and it's basically an entire year dedicated for the project we want to do.
Don Lemon is so cute, damn.
Didn't you fail a class at some point? Does it exempt you from that requirement? I mean I hope all that is true, but they upsold is the SRP as well, and it was underwhelming for everyone, what little support they gave us. Though I'm sure with your drive you could figure something out
Yes I forgot about Emily! You are right. 
Charlotte is doing a trip around Asia and then writing a paper about it, it's barely a thing. She just told them she is going on a trip whether they take it as an SRP or not, so they did
I wanted to get an internship with either an HIV organization or medical business in the field, but there are just very few positions if you are not 18 and do not have great prior networking
Yes but what is in the cholent? Wheat? Potatoes? What?
He is! I was reading the "about us" page on the surgeon's website, and my doctor is like 15 years older than I thought (like 45), and has been with his partner for like 20 years :) black people age so well
Upsold us*
Hi I'm sorry I've been with mommy
Her friend is so liberal and cultured. We've been talking about musicals and how Fox is so conservative and the Moors and about The Graduate.
We even talked about sexual harassment in the Air Force 
I've never failed a class, only a final.
Yeah my mom told me she would pay for me to go wherever I wanted. Also rosinbum has many historians as friends so there's that too.
What's the paper on?
I think it's going to be potatoes. The recipe is on my laptop, I'll let you know.
Lol I looked at his about us page too... 
Aww that's so cute. Probably met in med school lol.
Who is this friend? I'm glad you went to visit her :)
I look so scruffy and gross because I cannot raise my arms enough to shave, and my mom says appearances don't matter now and she's tired. 
 too! I've been here since 6 and it's been great. She's a coworker who also faced discrimination in the office so my mom was helping her out and they became good friends.
Did you want her to shave you?
Everything will be better soon hahah
Have you showered?
Aimee, I am relieved that everything worked out for you with this surgery and I am glad that you are doing fine. I really care about you and I think about how you are doing all the time.
What did she face?
See that sounds weird but otherwise I'll be all pube beardy by the time we get back, so yes.
Well I am not allowed to shower for 6 days.. The dressing cannot get at all wet. But my mom helped wash my hair and face today.
Thank you
Well since she's in her 50s they wanted some fresh blood so the people at the Legal Defenders were mean to her
Well since she's in her 50s they wanted some fresh blood so the people at the Legal Defenders were mean to her
It doesn't sound weird??? My mom had me wash her feet and legs with a washcloth and soap because she isn't allowed to take showers either.
I would understand if my mom also wanted me to shave her legs or something
I tweeze my underarms but lately I've been pulling the hair out by hand
That sounds incredibly painful, that's like tweeting pubes or worse
Nah it feels fine
Not tweeting, tweezing lol
Why did you do that
Instead of cheating or not doing it Li
Lol
Instead of cheating?
It evolved from boredom
Anyway good night!
I don't even know what that said I do not remember what it was supposed to mean
Eh that's alright.
I am mentally cloudy idk, I think it's all this medicine
Do you want to sleep?
I actually got a good night of sleep
I can leave you alone if you want
No I'm fine
I can leave you alone though
Haha no I just woke up again
Oh it is Saturday
I thought it was a weekday
I had this dream that everybody started to become obsessed with the Middle East like I was and then we just didn't talk anymore because you became this Middle Eastern prodigy
And then everybody wanted to be friend with a Jew so we didn't eat lunch anymore
Lol do you ever have dreams that we get closer and have great times?
Hahaha I do but I don't share them. Maybe I should, huh? In the dream we also watched Cabaret
In one of my grandpa's beds together 
It was really cute
I just feel like the abnormal stuff would interest you more so that's what I tell you
Omg! And in the dream I went to the doctor's office and they told me I was positive for HIV and then they also told me I was positive for drug use 
Lol I like hearing almost all dreams I find them interesting
Lol sorry, I inject you with dirty needle heroin while you sleep
why did I say lol twice? I do not know
Did I wake you up
You can sleep
For some reason I read the injection text in a Russian and Scottish accent
Did you finish cabaret
Like I subconsciously did it because I probably saw heroine out of my peripheral  
You did not wake me up. I actually fell asleep last night on the floor of the living room on top of an encyclopedia 
And then I woke up about 20 minutes later then moved to a bed
Then I woke up around 3 and went back to sleep
:( for some reason when I stream over cellular data it's so slow
Have you watched any movies?
Lol what were you reading that put you right to sleep in the encyclopedia. I remember I used to want an encyclopedia until I realized the convenience of Wikipedia. 
I am about to finish pretty woman and I watched encino man on Wednesday
Ok well I read about the Suez Canal, Israel, Israeli music, and Islamic law. I started falling asleep around Islam.
Lol cos I called you out on the suez 
My grandpa got the set of encyclopedias in exchange for a vacuum cleaner.
That is true! Thank you for doing so
Sounds like a fair deal. Encyclopedias used to be ducking expensive
They're from the 60's.
Verrryyyyy outdated
But interesting in perspective!
Comes from the times of Arab socialism which I was thought was an interesting concept
Encino Man oh my goodness. My alcoholic aunt recommended that almost every single day so I was very repulsed to see it
They still call Egypt the United Arab republic
It was only that for like very few years
It's actually pretty cool, did you read the wiki on it
United for a time with Syria
I have not read the wiki on it. All that I knew was that it was for a few years, but I shall do that.
Wiki is pretty much how I learned everything
It is really one of the greatest resources man has developed like ever
Tell me 5 wiki papes to peruse through 
*pages
Well I don't have any off the top of my head, but I'll send interesting ones your way
I used to spend hours starting at one page, reading it all, seeing what it linked to, reading some of those etc.
How about the 1953 Iranian coup d'état 
I wish I had time to do that..
Ok then you look up Warren Jeffs
I have before lol
Many times
You want me to again though?
Hahaha that's alright
I read a cool article about FLDS. I think it was maybe in Time? Idk. It had a lot of photos
Middle Eastern countries overthrowing democratically elected officials
Where have I seen that before
But
It was backed by CIA..
Ooooooh
It's very important background with Iran and explains a lot of their continuing resentment
I was wondering what FLDS was and then I said fundamentalist LDS and then looked it up and I was right
And it led to the 1979 revolution 
👏
You know those moments where you're content with your reasoning skills
yesss
Resentment towards US?
Yes, and the western world generally
Mostly US
Panteha's dad is really interesting to talk to about Iran, I regret not speaking to him more. He's very informed and a huge critic, probably mostly due to his atheism
Do you know what the reason is for the spread of FLDS into Mexico?
I think it is because for a time polygamy was legal or tolerated there
But I am not sure
My next thing is to tackle the history of Iran and Iraq.
I've been meaning to do that for quite some time.
Next week though, Sara invited me over for dinner so that I can experience 'Arab immersion'
Where is her family from again?
Tunisia and Palestine...
Tunisia sounds like an alright place
I think some grandparents lived in Palestine but then moved to Tunisia, so she considers herself part Palestinian 
I want to visit morocco
Do you know about Zoroastrianism?
Or Ba'hai
I also want to visit morocco. It just feels seems so disconnected from the rest of the Arab world because not much is going on.
I remember hearing the word in 7th and 8th grade history classes
*it seems
It is much more moderate it seems. And it has to be to maintain its tourism industry
Those are also possibly interesting wiki pages. 
I currently have open:
- 1953 Iranian coup d'état 
- Iranian Revolution
- FLDS
- Morocco
- Zoroastrianism
I'll tell you where I end up by the end of the day
Probably flannels
Lol ok
:)
How are you doing?
What's going on today
I am doing okay, it is just another day of laying in bed but maybe today I will be here enough to watch a movie or something. I've hair been sleeping pretty much all the time, and being women up for meals
It is enough mental exertion to try and figure out what drugs to take at what times
"being women up for meals" I assume you meant beating women up for meals? Just wait until Diviya hears about this. 
I just got off
Woken
Lol
Got off as in masturbate?
Being woken up for meals
Yes, that kind of got off. I've been doing it every night.
Also I thought of you! So yay
Lol yay
I think once I get home it won't be long until we can do it again
Or at least BJs, I'm not in bad condition
Omg
Every night?!? Unusual for you, no?
Basically the way it happens is that I keep promising myself I'm going to try things from the back and then I never do. I get too scared.
So I figure why not just do it since I'm already down there
:(
Also I'm exhausted by the end of the night and I tell myself it's a good stress reliever so I do it
You should, I don't want to be the first to do anything up there to you. I had sure done it to myself before I let you all up in there
Did you use soap or what
I think dry tbh
I forget
My fingers are not large
I cannot jerk off bc my arms are too painful, plus parents 24/7. I'm gonna be so horny when I get back..
Did you enjoy it though? How did it feel for you? I'm going to do it sometime this week, that's a promise. What happens though is that I lie down in the tub and start rubbing
Then it just feels so tight and I'm scared to go in
If you are scared it will clench and hurt
You have to be comfortable 
Eh I like dick in it a lot more, finger just kinda feels like shitting
What does the former feel like?
I am comfortable when I'm trying, maybe I'm just naturally tight.
I only get scared as I'm trying to get it in
And it's not doing anything 
If you don't have a lot of pain when you shit there is no reason it should be that tight when you try to go in if you are relaxed
Well, it depends on the angle, a lot. I couldn't really describe it though because we've only done it a few times and not recently 
Doesn't shitting feel peaceful though
Does it ever hurt??? 
I think it feels peaceful
Yes if it's TOO large, it has happened to me, a painful shit
Like really fat
Hahaha I'm laughing so hard I meant does anal ever hurt
Wait did you ever seen encino man
But yes :( those hurt too but sometimes they feel good after they come out
Fuck yes anal can hurt 
It can hurt like a motherfucker if you aren't wet or prepped
No, the movie looked bad...
It gets wet back there....?
Or someone has to do it
Well, either through lube, or for me the naturally occurring lube from the front can get back there and get my ass wet
it was a silly movie. I guess it wasn't good but it entertaining enough. You probably wouldn't like it
Ok I figure that's what it was or that you're sweaty lol.
Lol that would be grosser by a lot
Did you see the Rotten Tomatoes rating?!
No? I don't like RT. imdb all tha way
I guess so but I wouldn't know
Not that it did well on imdb
I just think some movies are so bad that they are great
Not encino man, but some movies
There is a guy in pretty woman that looks kinda like Martha's dad
Do you ever listen to music and lip sync like you're performing?
That's what I was just doing
Who's the actor?
This is such a bad pic of my mom but this is what she looks like
حبيبي احبك
I do that sometimes
His name is hector elizondo
She looks a lot like you in that pic
Habibi!
Oh wow he does look like Martha's dad in the movie. Not now though.
Really..? I think I look nothing like her.
Habibi❤️
Well mostly her skin tone and the dimples
And head shape
Who are the two women
God I finally shaved, finally. I pretty much have a full beard in a week minus the cheeks. If I let it grow for a month it would be a damn good beard
The lady on the left is a new face. Never seen her before. However the lady on the right is Isabel. She's so sweet. We went to her home for dinner one night.
You should have taken a picture! Damn it
Sergio that snap was such a good pic of you goddamn
You should do your hair like that! 
 
I really like these pictures lol they're going on Instagram 
I couldn't get good lighting :( I had like a scruffy mustache and stuff. But in general I look like a mess
Lol with the Arabic script???
Yeah I kept the arabic scripts it's really pretty
Hahaha I'm sure you didn't look too bad :)
Lol I hope you don't have church people on your insta
They gon call the FBI
Church people do follow me :( actually it's funny because as you sent that I was looking at one of their profiles
They never like my pics anymore after I posted the Little Prince picture
Which little prince pic?
Sorry I don't have Instagram so I would not know
Oh right, I thought you saw it when you were looking through my phone
Basically it was a picture of the book but the caption included "his book ❤️" or something like that 
And then people from school commented and it was just really dumb
What did they comment?
But the people from church don't like my pictures anymore. What if it was my grandpas book huhhhhh
"Aww"
"So cute"
Of course with a bunch of emojis
:))
Instagram is such a waste of time
It is
But so is like everything
I'll delete it but then download it again
I am watching this Swedish film
It's less a waste than evil apples
What is the film called?
We are the best!
Fuck! Evil apples oh my goodness glad that's over
Is that what it's called or are you just saying that hahah
That is the name of the film
But we are
:)
Is it one of those teen scene movies?
I didn't know you were into that kind of thing
Don't know yet, I'm not far into it, but I think it's a movie meant for adults, just kind of like insight into the cute and silly young mind. 
And their futile but silly pursuits 
There's this movie I want to see about a child who is unhappy with his life so he runs away into nature and ends up freezing to death. It's an interesting play on naïveté.
Question
Yeah?
Do you say futile like few-tile or like few-tuhl 
What is the movie called
I was hoping you would know
I use them interchangeably
Depends on the sentence
Usually it's kind of a blend of the two, not really either
Oh ok I like to say fewtile because it's how they say it in those sci fi movies haha
What movie should my mom and I watch today?
50/50
Jk jk
I don't know, what genre does she like
Basically everything but horror
Never seen 50/50!
Midnight in Paris?
I'm scared to open Zöe's snapchats now that she got a phone or something 
I don't want to talk to her again
Made it halfway through that movie in 9th grade
You probably missed most of the references to literature then though so it was less great
Mm get one of those apps
That lets you open it without it appearing to be opened
Like snapbox
So she won't know
I don't think you should talk to her, she is batshit, and once you get in you won't want to be a dick to her and tell her to fuck off
I remember getting bored very quickly
But I'll watch it again now that I am a more worldly person haha
I do not understand how it is so easy for some people to tell others to fuck off...
She is crazy but I felt like if I was her friend then I could discover the reason behind it
Well you were also crazy. 
See that is why you need not to get involved because you could not detach her from you
Okay but I wasn't crazy last year and she still was. I sat with her every morning... Once her and Tess got into this argument and that was bad.
Well I don't tell people explicitly ever to fuck off, I just taper off communication
But you weren't really a friend of hers as much last year
I had math with her. She sat right in front of me. One thing is that I understand her family situation but could not figure out why she had to be so rash and rude but then complained when people acted the same way towards her or others.
I try doing that but then I feel like an asshole
Well it's not really intentional, if I don't get along with someone we naturally won't have much to talk about so usually it just happens on it's own because neither of us gets much out of the conversation. But then there are people like Anna Marie, she is the only one that I think I will one day have to legitimately block
She probably didn't realize her hypocrisy 
My mom is already talking about her will because they're fearing she might go unconscious for a while 
Well Zoe used to do all the talking and I would nod my head
Why would she go unconscious? Are things looking bad right now??
She makes it sound like she's going to die this month or something
She's already telling me about how we're going to get monthly payments and I'm getting the car and all this stuff
Her blood pressure just suddenly dropped 
Does she look ok? What is going on? Are doctors surrounding her?
She is being irresponsible, freaking you out like that
And she's talking about who's going to claim me and put me under their social security benefits because I don't have a father
She looks fine...
Keizer's mom does my mom's cardiographs.
They rushed over when her blood pressure dropped
I think she is just having a realization of mortality and taking it out on you because she has no one else to rant to about it. It is difficult to realize that you are fallible
Is it back up now?
How do you feel about Keizer's mom being the person
Are you with your mom
What do you mean I'm fallible? It's not my responsibility to take any of these plans into action.  
No no
My grandpa is also here with us. It's mainly their conversation but they're asking me the occasional questions.
"You're going to live with grandpa and not with your friends, right?"
It's not back up yet but soon
I think it's strange... Especially since Keizer told her he has gay friends but I don't know if she knows it's me
When I said you I meant in reference to oneself. It is difficult for one to realize their own mortality. That is what I meant
Not that you are fallible, that she is fallible. That everyone is mortal. I am not phrasing things well, sorry
Is his mom homophobic
How do you know soon? What are they doing to help the blood pressure come up
Yeah I agree, I don't think now was the perfect time to discuss such matters. 
His mom is super homophobic. KZ's dad also said if he was gay he could cut of KZ's balls 
Do you think KZ is maybe actually gay but doesn't want it getting out for fear of his parents?
Or bi or just not 100% straight
Kinda like Anthony but to a greater degree
They took her off mess
Well basis provides an environment where someone should (at least for me?) feel comfortable coming out, so I think he would have already? Idk.
Perhaps bi.
Oh goodness Anthony.
I texted him this morning because I felt bad for not replying all week and he said:
"Hahahaha like a week later"
"Better late than never I guess"
Ok so you kinda do do what I do... In terms of not communicating with people
:(
Aww what's wrong
Haha yeah, but not with you.
I mean with certain people too I don't feel obligated to reply back within a reasonable time
Especially friends
What have you been doing?
It's just sad the whole situation with your mom and how she is handling it, she is doing things that really are stressful to other you know
I am watching we are the best still. It's hard for me to focus so it takes a long time
Oh btw I didn't mean mess, I meant meds. They lowered her dosage.
 I caught that
Yeah we just ate lunch together and during prayer I just started crying, I couldn't do it 
Is it good?
Yeah it's pretty funny and cute 
It's endearing
:(( 
Is she still gonna be released soon?
This is super TMI but I haven't shit in like 3-4 days bc of pain meds and I'm so bloated and gross. I took 2 laxatives a couple hours ago and still nothing. I am worried I will explode or something. I look so fat
That's so unhealthy!!!!! Have you been eating?? I've actually gone that long without pooping too because I was embarrassed for people to know I was going poop. I was a strange kid.
This was during a Boy Scout camp.
She'll be out on Tuesday if all goes well.
Have you tried using the bathroom?
Or do you just not feel the need to poop
Yes! I have been eating quite a lot. I don't know how my intestines are handling it.
That is strange...
Then what? She won't go straight back to work, right?
So I haven't really tried but I don't feel the urge at all, and it hurts to walk and exert myself so I would rather not cross the apartment in vain. It may have to happen though. 
I was just very embarrassed to have other people know that my body does the normal functions.
She won't.. I don't know what she's going to do.
Maybe you should try?
Actually no if it hurts then don't bother, but you can't keep holding it in even if you don't feel like you have to.
Ok after this movie finishes in 20 min I will go
To be fair many people are ashamed of masturbation and that's a normal function too, so I guess it's not that abnormal
Is it all ok with her job? Like she has sick time or whatever? They won't fire her right??
But I didn't do that until last year and when I would deny it people always said I was lying
Idk :( she's going to continue working at DEA hopefully
They know she's in the hospital 
We're watching this super dramatic lifetime movie about teen partying and it's giving my mom such a bad idea about what we do at parties
What is it called? What happens in the movie. Lol dramatic and lifetime movie together is 
redundant. 
Mm I think that's because you were so ridiculously sexual that it was hard to believe you weren't wanking it
It's called The Choking Game hahah. Some new trend to get high.
'Wanking it'
There is this movie on Lifetime called Whitney I want to see. Angela Bassett is in it!
I just saw the advertisement for that when I clicked the link
Who is Angela Bassett...
She was in Malcolm X, American Horror Story, and Boyz n the Hood
Is it true AHS is doing an OJ Simpson spinoff???
No, I thought it was just the OJ Simpson trial covered by Ryan Murphy?
Oh you are probably right. Caleb said that and I was like wtf
Does he watch AHS too?
Yeah. He is really boring. I think in a similar manner to Anthony
Lol Anthony is so quick to reply to me, like always within 5 minutes, but his responses are so mundane no matter what I tell him.
Same..
With Caleb
And all he does is watch tv
Did he make any friends
In college
When do you want to watch moonrise
Yeah he has a couple of friends but he says he doesn't really like any of them and he wishes he never went to Kenyon
Or rather when do you think you will have time
:( poor guy. Why doesn't he transfer to u of a and save $$$
I was trying to watch it in this hospital but they block EVERYTHING
We can do it tonight if you want? :)
Like all useful websites or all video?
Ok! If I'm awake lol
My dressing is so tight. I'm trying to remember what the doc said about messing with it if it hurt, but all I seem to remember is that he said they sewed on nipple pillows to my skin..
Surgery is weird
I have no idea! Maybe I'll ask him haha
I am afraid that my college experience will be like his. It sounds horrible
Yes, YouTube and Netflix and illegal movie streaming sites haha
Nipple pillows? How does that work? Do they ever come off?
My mom is going to apply for temporary disability
Her doctor told her to
Ok this is a stupid question but do you still have your nipples or did you get new ones?
Nope they are never coming off, I got new nipples tattooed on
Just kidding! I kept mine lol
They were reduced in size though, and moved to a more masculine position
It is just to protect the nipples because they got moved ya feel
How long is "temporary"?
Do you know when breast augmentation and reduction surgeries started happening in the US?
I just gave my mom a bath and cleaned her hair and body
Not sure, maybe a month or two?
Just until her doctor tells her she can work again.
Well, before I answer your q I must say this is not considered either of those, what I got is a lot more involved of a procedure. 
It appears breast augmentations began in the 50's mostly though. 
My mom washed my hair 5 min ago
Oh. Maybe it will be a welcome break for her
She doesn't have a nurse?
Oh ok, I'm sorry. I didn't know. 
Is it strange for your mom to wash your body? Like your back and legs? 
She does but the final orders come from the doctor.
She did not wash my body lol. I would be weirded out by that
It's fine haha no reason why you would know
No I mean she doesn't have a nurse to bathe her?? That's seems like something you wouldn't be expected to do
She's not supposed to bathe because she needs to stay hooked up to the machines... So I used a washcloth and some soap and washed her.
I would also be weirded out to have my mom wash me
The nurse did offer to change her clothes but I don't think my mom felt comfortable
So I had to do it instead
I don't mind though
How is she feeling? Has she said anything?
She is grateful that I helped her and feels clean. We're still watching shitty lifetime movies haha.
Speaking of shitty, did you use the restroom
Also did you finish your movie?
I have not, though I did try to go.
And yes it was ok not great. I then started Kramer vs Kramer. I'm 30
Min into it
I'm going on a drive now. First time leaving the apt for a couple days
That's great! Be safe :)
#seatbelt
So the house out apartment is in is worth $2.5M. Shit here is ridiculous. Though the view is amazing. I'll send the pics later
Our
I still have pictures of the view and I could imagine breathing in fresh air while looking out at the water. Also that is ridiculous, like more expensive than NYC
Well, it might be a decently sized house I'm not sure I haven't seen the other half but it looks a bit bigger
Anyway, what is up with your brothers
Oh oh oh
Omg I'm such an idiot
I thought it was just that apartment not the whole house
Oops
I haven't seen them in days but apparently they're supposed to come over tonight. 
You know what's weird? My brother's dad (who has a girlfriend and a new son) told my mom he still loves her and always has...
You're not going to formal, right?
When is it?
That is very awkward with brother's dad...
Also he is a shit head I hope she doesn't actually consider him an option
Ok I just looked it up- no I won't be in town, and even if I was there is no way I can do that a week from now :(
Well I might get there on the 17th during the day actually
Maybe I can come to the before events? Like the prep? 
I want to be a part of it but I definitely cannot dance or stand or anything for 4 hours
It's the 17th! I just bought my ticket today.
Oh yeah that would be fun. Or we could leave early maybe?
Maybe at 9 or 10?
She doesn't consider him in any way hahah don't worry
Well I won't have anything to do once we get there and I know you like dancing and stuff so you should go for the whole time, I'll just get dinner with you guys before if possible
I was just going to suggest that. We always go to ihop so that would be nice :)
That'll probably be 11:30 though so it might not be good for you
I meant before, like if we ate before?
After would not be good for me
Maybe we could get a light meal? Or just meet up at Madeleine's before to put on clothes/makeup/hang out 
Or Diviya's 
Being out late is not a good option for me.
Also don't count me in for driving because I cannot drive
Yeah well I know Madeleine and Diviya have to spend a long time at La Paloma to set up
So I think they're only doing dinner after :/
Well maybe I can hang out with you guys at la Paloma before?
Try to help out in small ways?
You're so cute
But you'll have to ask Amanda first hahah!
Fucking hate her 
So is that a no?
You don't have to strain yourself!
I can still see you that weekend if you want? It's a 3 day weekend.
Well I don't know I just want to do something related to the event if possible but if not, that's how it is
Also Diviya said they're not doing anything beforehand
Only setting up.
Ok then I guess we will just hang out sometime over the weekend
I hope you have a fun time :)
And don't let Zayna say I'm ditching you lol, I'll have you know that I would much prefer a dance to staying in bed but it is simply not an option
You know anybody could just walk into the hospital and go into any room, it's terrible.
Lol when I told her you might not go she rolled her eyes
But I might just go with Reyna or Martha 
Also I'm so excited to get a tie for the theme!!!!
:(
Did you explain why at least I'm not going to her?
Also moonrise tonight..?
What tie will you get
I just told her that you were in San Francisco and that you don't like to dance.
Well it depends which girl I go with because that determines the color of my tie
Mmmmm maybe :/ turns out my brothers are coming home with us so I'll have to put Alex to sleep, but I could ask Richie to do it for once
I'll say 9:30? If that's okay with you?
Actually good news (for you)
My brothers might not come lol
So maybe 8:30
Ok, if it's before 9 ok but if it's after that we'll just watch it another day. No pressure at all though
We can always watch it next week too?
Yeah that's fine
How was your time out?
Nice, but cut short by having to get back to take antibiotics. We saw the entrance to the San Quentin prison as well as the ferry to San Francisco proper. It is interesting that there is almost nothing directly on the bay. 
How was your day
That's nice! I've never heard of the San Quentin prison.
Tiring... I've been at hospital all day.
We have been watching those forensics shows.
Which forensics shows?
Yeah it's like death row for Cali, it's pretty isolated, many guard towers and gates and things. 
Forensics Files, it was scary :( also America's Most Wanted scared me throughout my whole childhood.
My grandpa got here and one of the first things he said was, "at church today there were xicans! Just like the old days"
Was he trying to say that in previous times there were more xicans at his church? Did he ever attend another denomination? Pretty sure the further you go back (in recent times) xicans were more uniformly catholic 
He grew up as a catholic but converted in early adulthood.
Our church has had some success in missionary work, especially in Africa and Europe.
I'm not sure what he meant. I know that there has been a low turnout in the church for years now.
What have you been doing?
Europe? Like what part of Europe? 
Well, I just finished Kramer vs. Kramer which was about a divorce and gender roles in the 70's. It won best picture, but it's hard to see why without the relevance of gender politics and divorce. 
Now I might watch another film. I am not sure. 
It has a bunch of popular radio stations from various countries
Mmmmm France for sure. Spain too, I think?
Yeah I read about Kramer vs. Kramer. I'm adding it to my list.
Well if you want to watch Moonrise Kingdom I will be home before 9...
Thank you! I will definitely check it out soon.
I don't think you would like it it's pretty uninteresting as a story, but if you want!
It's literally exactly what I meant when I said old movies tend to have less interesting plots, it's all nuanced I suppose but not if you know the nuances of the time. 
Not if you don't know*
Lets watch it another day
Alright
Did you decide on a movie to watch?
I'm watching Psycho
Sorry I spaced
I'm gonna watch the apartment. 
I thought you saw that film already
What order are you going in or how do you choose the movies
No, that was half of vertigo
Well, now I'm onto the 4th list, since I only had 4 left on the 3rd after pretty woman, so I just chose what looked alright. 
Why didn't you finish vertigo 
I don't understand why you choose some of the movies you do though, like encino man.
It was on a school night and I watched half then never finished
Couldn't say why, some of the premises just strike me, cos they are original I guess. Like encino man or minority report, I just wanted to know how they would turn out. 
Encino man in particular was referenced on reddit and linked in some clip and it was so ridiculous that I thought I had to see it, and I'm always looking for dumb films to intersperse, because I can't watch the godfather 5 times a week
How do you pick movies
Usually there are some movies on Netflix that I'll see that are also on my list, not in any particular order, so I'll just watch it. I don't go list by list, but rather one list collectively. 
Tonight it was between precious, psycho, and rain man.
Whatever I watch varies on my mood.
What mood inspired psycho?
Just kidding
Anyway I'm going to sleep
So good night!!
Oh alright
Goodnight 
I just fingered myself quite a few times and it was the most amazing thing ever I was so out of breath and it felt so different I love it
Wow!
Yup haha
I can't believe you never did that before
Anyway how is your today looking
I had very strange dreams- I was at a Harvard physics class at one, I don't really remember the others well but I know they were weird
I remember giving a dick massage
Wbu
We were on the same dodgeball team and you weren't very good, so the judge gave you a bunch of supplies and you only won because of them. I was really upset and didn't talk to you.
Lots of hw, wbu
That is strange, a lot of my dreams had that sort of theme, winning because of reasons like that.
Well I'm really tied up, Tina of homework in all my classes plus prior engagements of all kinds-- I'll be watching movies all day
That's so unfair. Maybe I'll get my wisdom teeth out next.
Doesn't today feel different 
It does to me
What does anything have to do with wisdom teeth?
Lol not particularly to me. That was yesterday that felt different
Well you're only able to watch movies with all that hw because you're not in town :( unless you're emailing stuff?
What happened yesterday?
Why do we pronounce 'one' the way we do
I don't actually have any homework, I was joking. Even if I was in town I wouldn't have homework haha.
Yesterday I stopped taking oxy and switched to Tylenol and it was a new age. Didn't realize how out of it I was til I was past it. The past two days were a complete blur. I don't get why people abuse it though there was no pleasant feeling or anything, just mental fog
Should I leave you to complete your work peacefully?
Let me just say I really want to have anal
I needed to get that out there
My mom is so ridiculous when it comes to addictions and methods of getting high. She makes it sound like she's the expert on all of it and thinks she knows not only why people start, but the feeling of it.
I don't start work until like 3 or 4 hahah.
This morning I've been lazy.
I think I'm a bottom
I got that impression.. What do you want to do about this?
Lol well I used a bunch of lube so we definitely need to be in a bed
Ok how do you feel about strap ons...
I love the way you phrased the text, like my newfound love for bottoming is so problematic.
I can still top though! If that's what you're worried about.
Actually I feel bad now you can just ignore it all
I don't know for what cause but I've been emotionally strange while pent up and gross here. I see myself in the mirror unshowered and with messed up hair in sweatpants, and bloated for (still) lack of ability to go to the bathroom (TMI sorry) and I wonder what you could see in me. I need to get back to the normal routine, haha. There is no reason your newfound love should harm out relationship and it is only my insecurity in thinking so. So in short, "lol I'm cool w strapons."
What! No! Why would you feel bad? 
I think regardless of the meds, those feelings are normal in a relationship because I always feel the same way. Also it's not TMI lol, my mom is in the hospital right now and I'm taking care of her too. It's sad because they didn't want her walking so she had to use a portable toilet seat right next to her bed.
Idk I thought that the strap on question had offended you
And I only want to do things that we're both comfortable with
Ok basically I thought that I made you think I was dissatisfied with you because you lacked what I need to fulfill my newfound love but that wasn't the case at all
No why would that offend me? I'm totally comfortable with that though I wonder how we would acquire such a thing. I can't ask an 18 year old senior to buy a strap on in the same way I could ask one to buy a bong
Yes that is what I felt momentarily but it wasn't your fault, and was easily resolved. I don't have any issue with strapons in principle or negative emotional assosiation I just hoped you were happy and satisfied with the options available
I think it's funny that this is a conversation about strap ons.
Maybe Anna Marie and you could tell her it's a gag gift.
But I completely understand what you're saying. 
I am satisfied :)
You're wonderful
Ok I'll research things
:)
90 hour phone call?
Where are you?
D pic..?
Yeah I was on the phone with my mom for 90 hours
It just felt like it
You want a d pic?
I'm at house
Yes!
Great
Ok also, you will at some point watch lost in translation, as I did. And I didn't really get what the big deal was but I just read this review and now I do. So after you watch it, be sure to read this. Put it in your notes or something: 
That was awesome 10/10
Very appreciated thank you
More or no?
Yes
The first one was so hot
: )
That was really hot for me too
Lol
God I think I had forgotten what it meant to be horny and have nothing to do about it. I am so horny I could cry
And each reminder is such a welcome tease that I couldn't look away if distracted by $1000 just offscreen (and I'm a jew so that's a big deal)
I'll watch the movie this week!
There are some hidden reminders of us having sex throughout my days  
?
Like taking out the garbage to the alley and then I'm like "oh, we had sex in this alley once"
Or I got a blowjob
Also the Jew thing was really funny when I read it earlier
You actually make me laugh sometimes
:P
When you send your treasure trail pics it's mesmerizing 
You are great
Haha walk into an alley, hmm I think I have a blowjob here once..
🌷💕☺️
Lol I feel like I can pretty much say that now.
Jk jk
It is so foggy here, it is like we are in a cloud. One could believe there is nothing around because you can't see more than a couple meters. 
Where are you now
I've been in fog before at a Boy Scout camp in San Diego! We slept in this huge outdoor ramada on a hill and then when we woke up we were above the fog and it was slowly creeping up towards us.
I was also in a cloud this summer on Mt. Lemmon
Grandpa's backyard watching Alex. He's out and about. 
Pics?
Well most of the fog is gone now, it was much worse earlier. But here is a comparison of now and yesterday when there was no fog: 
 
Though earlier I could not see past the tree, nor could I see the ground below it
When you are free again of responsibility promptly tell me
Those houses are pretty nice but not worth the millions
What floor are you on?
Haha why? Did you want another d session
Location location location!
I'm in the bottom floor? There are 2 floors and apartment takes up the bottom one. 
No......... ...yes
So then the owner lives on the top?
Lol are you serious
Well the owner's daughter I think. The owner and his wife live in France. 
I am free of responsibility
And am promptly telling you
Pants are a responsibility 
You should continue
Hahahahaha
1. That was so funny your fat face in background and d tip in foreground like a monster 
2. It is clear that someone has a newfound love for his rear
You're mean :(
What?
I meant fat face endearingly 
Yeah I'm sorry, I won't send that if you don't want me to
Lol why are you sorry
I have no issue! I just thought it was funny
No I meant if you don't want rear pics
I do, I do
You are hearing what you are afraid I will say rather than what I am saying
That's true to some extent
I just thought you only liked the dick
But I was so into it that I just sent the rear pics
And then when you said that idk
It is all great
How is everything there
Your mom and all that is she doing better
You see, I'm self conscious too
Everything is good. We're going home to vail now to feed animals and get clothes
She's fine and coming home mañana. 
What have you even done all day?
Who has fed them until now?
Lol no reason for you to be you are like sculpted. 
I have been trying to watch the apartment. I am most of the through now
She isn't supposed to walk and they want her to come home? 
Guess who has been feeding them!!! Nobody!!!!!!! It's sickening!!!! Nobody cares about them.
"Sculpted"
It's true have you seen your ass lately
It's like a perfect bubble butt
Do you not have neighbors what the fuck what if they died
Oh she wasn't supposed to walk from Sunday-Wednesday
I'm sorry your household does not deserve animals
You let them go, starve them...
We do but nobody coordinates anything with them
You is the wrong word.
"You guys@
"
It's my mom and my brother. I specifically chose not to own any animals because I knew with all my homework I would not be able to give it the attention it needs.
My ass actually has gotten bigger and my waist has gotten smaller.
You aren't blameless. You are 16 years old, you could figure something out. They are your responsibility as well even if you don't want them
Especially the poor turtles :(
But they are probably ok and hibernating and for that you are lucky
You measure your ass?
They are! But the sugar gliderss 
That's the problem
My mom doesn't trust any of the neighbors to come into our home... 
And friends are not willing to drive all the way out to feed our animals
Ok I don't exactly measure it with a tape measurer but I do it by appearance and with my hands
Gliderss
Do you keep around body pics of yours
Gliderss was a typo
Back when I posted them on tumblr yes, but not so much anymore. When I do though I delete them fairly soon.
I know it was just funny.
You posted shirtless etc. on tumblr??
I always fear I'm going to accidentally put a video/pic I'm sending you in my story
Yes... Didn't I tell you that? Gloria had started me on this website called daily booth and then I thought 'why not on tumblr?'
I think you mentioned it but I didn't remember
I am afraid of posting to story too 
What is daily booth?
Hahaha during class that day Nico raised his hand and said something like "oh I think Thoreau was trying to place monetary value on those animals" and Connolly 
told him he was close
Then immediately after kristie raised her hand and said "oh! Like money? I think he's trying to say something about--" then Connolly cut her off and said no
Sara and I burst out laughing because she literally said the same thing
And the way Connolly cut her off
Does your body feel any different? Did you actually feel lighter after surgery or was it just numb? could you tell something was missing?
Sorry my phone died
Love Connolly sometimes
It just feels like a lot of pressure? It's all wrapped up very tight so I don't know where skin stops and bandage begins at all. I have not a lot of sensation
How dare your phone die
Did you ever have her???
No I never did actually. Strange, as it seems everyone else has
Who is your favorite teacher this year, and which is your favorite class
My mom brought a stethoscope home and Alex was playing with it, then he put it to my mom's heart and said, "it says... I love you!" It was so cute.
What interactions have you had with her? Do you ever go in her room?
Favorite teacher would have to be Swindle and favorite class is a tie between physics and bio and Chinese.
Wbu?
That is really cute. Idk she always says hi to me and tries to talk to me but we haven't had a real serious conversation. I don't really go in her room. 
Eh, I think my classes are too not serious this year to make a distinction. But I really like Zeitler and Winkelman as teachers, and Biology is the best
Why swindle
I stand by my word when I say I dislike Connolly.
Swindle is lax but not completely immature. His lessons are short and concise, then we have homework time. 
Everyone who has Zeitler loves her but they say she gives too much work.
Mm everyone has very low standards after hubman. She doesn't give much work at all but she does have high expectations for writing and speaking and things. She moves through very quickly in class and it is stressful, I agree. 
What do you even do in her class
Was hubman that bad? Apparently Brody is really bad.
Lol we read texts and discuss them as a class or in groups. We also have the occasional essay.
Sometimes I let her read our texts and we discuss them
Jk that was dumb
Nah, she was fine but we didn't learn much. Nice person
Well at least in my grade Brody got fucked with literally all the students who don't care in my whole grade
Plus Haley
I think if she had a normal class she would be fine
Does she go on rants
About weird shit
Isn't Haley one of the girls who doesn't care though?
Not at all
Connolly goes on the most irrelevant and redundant rants known to man
She had almost a 4.0 for most of high school
They are such a waste of time and everybody gives zero fucks
I don't care about her husbands distaste for tapioca pudding 
Husband's
And she always makes stupid comments like "if the teachers here were paid by how intelligent they are, I would be really wealthy"
"My brain has more money out into it than all of you guys will have"
*put
Or like she answers her phone or texts during class and announces what the conversations were about
Also her tattoo is so unappealing 
She's annoying
She has a tattoo?
She does sound pretentious
A lot
She recently got a tattoo of her husband's name on her leg.
Story time
In 7th grade this boy named Marcos shaved his legs and the straight boys called him gay and a fag, of course jokingly. Anyway I started crying and I was like, "I try to live up to the meaning of born this way and Lady Gaga says 'no matter gay straight or bi'"
It was absolutely ridiculous
Like the boy just shaved his legs because they were too hairy
God
Your reaction to like everything
Was just to cry and say something overly emotional
You and Shawn too
That's a trashy tat IMO
Which straight boys??
Omg ok I was 12 years old and I had just come out.
You know what I did when I was 12 and had just came out?
Not that lol
The script is what makes it 10x more trashy 
like Elliot and that group.
Yeah okay thank you very much
Our situations are all different 
What script?
Mhm no excuse. Even my trainwreck of an awkward phase was 15x less bad than you :)
Her tattoo script
Okay. Well I'm not like that now so.
I know you hate when I talk about it, don't get so frustrated! I'm done though
No I know what does it look like is it cursive?
Yeah I know, I'm sorry.
It is cursive but the letters are crunched together
It looks like a square of one word
What have you even done all day
Hi I took a nap
Earlier I watched TV
Wbu
That's great! I was falling asleep on my way to the library which is where I am now.
All I have to do is apush, Chinese, and seminar.
I went on a walk with the dog and finished math. 
My mom has been overly sentimental all day.
Lol that sounds like almost the majority of your work
How has she been overly sentimental
I know :( but I'm confident that I'll get it done
Idk like she was crying at the dinner table and has been quiet all day
Lol you had all day and you start so late
Might as well take tomorrow off too. Ah well I do the same thing sometimes
What was she crying about
I have 950 words and I need approximately 1200. My mom had me watch my brother today and kept telling me to take a break from math... So that's why I'm starting so late. 
Because my brother and I fight all the time
I have 4 pages and I need around 5.5-6
Last night my mom gave me this Swarovski necklace but it's a women's necklace...
Pretty sure no guys wear necklaces anyway, except Jesus people and ghetto rats
Pic of necklace?
I'm not home! But later.
Lol it's basically a ring with a heart in the middle of it
And she was crying and said that it means I'll always be in her heart
Are you gonna wear it out
Ha ha ha ha ha
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA
I rarely even wear jewelry
Do you do scarves?
Oh honey. I am too gay to think it's cold enough in tucson to wear scarves, and not gay enough to do it anyway
We should get each other rings.
Lol jk
Fuck yeah I finished my paper with 1203 words!
Yes, we shall get each other ring pops and then suck each other off.
Oh shit nvm I have more to do with my essay nvm
What do you have to do
on the AP seminar website it says 2000 words but rainy and Martha said its actually 1200 I was so scared, so nvm
?? That is very confusing
What all do you need to submit for them to grade
Basically we submit a 1,200 word individual essay, then a 2,000 word group essay with a group reflection. Then in May we sit down and analyze an article and write about it.
I'm just so happy I finished and I'm proud of this essay
That's great!
Tbh sounds like a very light load for an AP, like you easily could not even  have a class if you were a decent writer
I was thinking and
Being gay oppresses women. That must be why I chose to be gay
It is a very light load because we basically do nothing in class and have very few assignments. On Monday we literally spent the hour doing wiki races, and I won two consecutive rounds haha.
No I mean not the class
Like the whole AP. it's just not a lot of knowledge 
How does being gay oppress women...
It's like AP lit but without hellish multiple choice
Because we tell them the truth about their horrid fashion choices?
It was something I saw on tumblr that was so ridiculous it came full circle. I think the idea was that gay guys aren't physically attracted to women and that is shallow so they are oppressing them
Pretty much and the short essay is much easier. The article is on the topic "genius" and we write like three paragraphs.
Lol what the fuck you could literally say the same about anybody, not just gays
I could say the same about straight boys
Was it for real?
But you can't oppress men, duh. 
I think it was, not sure.
I'm sorry it has to be this way but I am breaking up with you because you are in denial and you need to see the light and grow. I can't date people who claim to be cis, because they are so blind. Come back to me when you pronounce your new pronouns to the world (preferably nonbinary ones? :)) 
#cisfree2015
#nopenis
God the humor is just endless with tumblr
People like this make me wish the demise of humanity would come sooner
That is absolutely ridiculous. Cis free?!
Oh I'm so sorry that I feel comfortable with the body I have
What a crime
Equality my ass
Pic of your comfortable body?
You sly bastard
That was great
'Twas all a setup
You deserved it
:);):)
Why'd you screenshot the Quran lol
I didn't, my phone died in the middle of the snap so I guess it just said that? Idk
To use for defamation hmm
I'm in such a good mood!
Do you have any porn on demand?
Yes let me make some one sec
Lol is that a joke
I assume you mean find some
It was not gonna be a joke
But it can be
A joke
No no!!!
It shouldn't be
Oh I really miss that
God the slip was so hot I tried to screen shot but accidentally pressed screen and skipped :(( oh well
Vid?
I was already making a vid when you said that haha
Yours were sooo good
:)))
Yours too goddamn
Did you come?
Yap
So this is what we've come
*become
How many times have you came this week?
We've come to each other lol
Only once
This is the first time since leaving tucson, or at least since surgery, not sure
I can't wait until we actually come on each other
I really need you
That is so sad haha, was it worth the wait?
Mm around day 3 I would have said absolutely yes, now, idk. I would wait 3 days in the interest of better experience but not a week, it's too much. Still, gr8 orgasm. 
I need you too
What will we do when I'm back in town? Lets go on a real date
Where to
Too much in terms of the wait or the intensity?
:)
Yes! I'll pay this time. We can go sneak into Inherent Vice and go out to dinner and then just walk around in the park
Ooh there's Bison Witches, Casa Vicente, Govinda's, Rincon Market, Caruso's, Ali Baba
Or that one place we went with the rose water
Idk it was just so long that my body seemed to settle down for the long haul not expecting any attention so the drive peaked around 3 days and then crashed.
I'll pick up the movie tickets
And you the food, ok?
Govinda's sounds great
Oh no I have a fandango gift card lol so the movie and food would have been no problem
Govinda's is one of my favorite restaurants!
Also Govinda's is cheap
Oh ok that's great!
Maybe we could see imitation game instead? Inherent vice is really long to be doing things before and after
Plus imitation game is leaving theatres soon
Not that I don't want to see inherent vice at some other time soon, I do!
Ok I'm sorry I always ask but your birthday is the 20th?
Alright :) what day do you want to do it? Remember we have no school Monday.
So Sunday is an option
Hahaha it's the 29th. And yours is July 15th
What about doing it Monday
I totally forgot we had the day off
I just always depend on Facebook to tell me birthdays and it's so upsetting because your birthday isn't there
But I knew it was coming up
Perhaps! Scouts might be cancelled I'm crossing my fingers 
Oh right I forgot about scouts
Lol yes I did that cos I hate the notifications I get about random other people and the birthday shit blowing up my feed
So I don't post mine so I'm not a hypocrite
When is Martha's birthday
It's in September, I think 19th? 
Let me check and hopefully I'm right
Oops September 16
My phone does all FB notifications collectively so for birthday messages it will say "you have 30 notifications"
Or "25 likes"
I just get the one "it is [person I don't remember much]'s birthday!" Notification. But I figured out how to turn it off this week which is great
I am the kind of person that needs to take care of notifications so I don't have the app badge
So it is irritating
For some reason I got a notification when Ale posted a selfie?
What does badge app mean
Like the red number circle 
I sometimes get random notifications too
Omg we need to do another cooking day and make some hummus 
I didn't know you could get rid of that...
And a clean movie night until the movies end
Woww
We don't even really ever do things in movie theaters 
Unlike almost everyone we know
I meant at your house? Lol
Oh
Tranquilo
Ohh
When are we gonna do the thing with the clean movie night and the others
Tequila. No
We could do it Sunday?
Tequila is so good, that's how leo and I bonded
We were the only ones who could take multiple straight shots of it
And we thought it was delicious
It is in your genes
And your jeans
Lets do it next week? Don't want to over-do it this weekend with an event like that
Oh yeah this week is formal lol I totally forgot, shit
It can be out of my jeans ;)
Plus I am not in a condition to have the crazy and awesome sex that we should have if we have a bed and a night to ourselves
Yeah that too 
Lol you know if you asked me to restrict myself I could do it
It's not like I'm going to be using your chest to hold my body up as I'm going in
Or like going crazy with you
Like you said, hjs and making out. Keep it slow.
Lol in what context did I say that
Well also I think the rubbing of the bed against my chest as you bang me back and forth could be problematic
I asked when we would be able to have sex and then you said we could keep it slow and stick to hjs and making out
Lol we should have a night where
Oh yeah you're right
We spend a shit ton of time working up to it as if we were virgins like
A night where we just sit there crisscross applesauce and stare at each other.
Yep!
Or that too
I actually think that would be really fun
I think about that kind of thing sometimes
Cuddling and then making out and then light touching and then it would be like 2 hours before sweet release
Really? You think about it?
Like reenacting the first kiss and everything 
I do
Now you're making me feel weird
No no
I think it would be fun
As do I. Taking it slow just makes things more special.
Like that one amazing night
We didn't really take it slow then though
I mean kind of
Well I'm not saying taking everything slow because obviously we were in a car and we have curfews
But just taking the sex slow was still nice
Yes the sex itself was slow
It was nice
And perhaps if we take the entire process slow that would be very nice 
It was so nice
When I came that time it felt so different
I can remember what it feels like
And after was great too
Can you describe it?
I remember you didn't rub at all once you pulled out
I can't describe it without sounding cheesy hahah
It felt like some greater power was rising inside my body? My chest felt really powerful 
What do you mean rub?
Idk like I can recall the feeling of blue balls and certain orgasms
Like normally you pull out and then jerk yourself for a second. That time you just pulled out and put it on my thigh and came.
I don't know what happened that night but it was really special for me too. I cannot describe 
How many times have I honestly blue balled you? Not that many I believe lol
I was thinking about that line from Pulp Fiction about silence and then you said it and it was like my life was complete and I could die right then and there
Like I was literally thinking the same thing moments before you said it
I think once! Go you!
Kudos for Aimee
You are the best and I'll never get tired of telling you that because you deserve to hear it all the time.
:))
Yes that pulp fiction moment
I'll look back at my heyday and remember that night
Are you one hour behind?
Unless every night we have becomes like that! I wonder if there are couples like that. Maybe that's what great sex that people talk about is. Still I'll probably remember it as the first time we had that.
Yes, it's 859
Actually it turned 900 just before I sent
#nolies 
I strongly believe that was what passionate sex is. It was indescribable and beyond words.
Doing that every night would be terrible! You're not going to appreciate the rare occasions when it does happen.
Or
Wow so then you really do go to sleep early
It's just awesome and you don't get tired and you appreciate it every time because its awesome
If you're having sex 2-3 times a week and it feels like that each time it would be strange
It's so funny how we weren't expecting anything different that night
It just happened naturally
Right? It wasn't even in a nice place, it was normal alley car sex. I really wonder what caused it to be so different. It's not like we had a particularly nice evening before it that was so different from others
Lol I remember telling Bella I had the most passionate sex ever and then she asked where and I felt so ashamed 
She cannot even say anything lol. It would be different if it was Jen or something
Did she say she had had similar sex?
No, she said that their sex is usually rough 
He squeezes her boobs and chokes her
I just really can't imagine Bella having wild kinky sex
Also I don't understand how couples who have been together for years stay virgins for so long
Like Carly and Fox
Or Jen and Joseph earlier this year
(Late 2014)
Well, we have a lot more time together alone you know, like because I drive etc.
I think it changes the landscape
Lol our first time doing any of that stuff was on Bella's bed
I really don't get the whole thing about virginity for non religious people outside of the practicality of finding a time and a place
Thx for the reminder
Because everybody romanticizes the sacredness of virginity and giving it to "the one"
Like why wouldn't you just have sex? I guess you lose the exploration, but soon enough just normal pump and dump gets old and you explore again, so really you don't miss anything
We see that concept everywhere 
I guess that is true
Are you happy you lost it
To me
Do you wish you had lost it earlier or waited
I guess something that makes me sad is that I won't be the only one to have sex with and vice versa 
*with you
Why does that make you sad?
And that what we have now is just going to be another person - maybe for both of us - in just a few years 
Because I really like you
Just because things aren't permanent doesn't make them worthless
At all
I think it's great what we have
As do I, but I think of the nostalgia if I ever see you again
Idk it's stupid
Just enjoy it now :) it's no use to be sad now
I'm not sad! It's just so strange to me
Lol you want to hear something silly
No
Jk. Ok
Shawn was like "when I'm a senior I'm going to go to Japan for my SRP and I'm going to take you with me, I promise you that and I keep my promises."
Any other funny Shawn stories?
And he said I love you after like two weeks of just knowing him! He sent this super long text about how we would take a bullet for me haha
He also attached a picture he took of two flamingos making a heart at the San Diego zoo
*he would take 
For Christmas I had gotten him a candle and I remember I was at this winter break camp and he sent a picture of his feet coming out of bubbles from a bath with the lit candle on the side
And I remember I had this sleepover at his house and he was hard, then his mom knocked on the door it was so funny. He was wearing basketball shorts 
We both called Demi during that sleepover and left her a voicemail and then we started making out and you could hear slobbery kisses hahahaha
We stayed up until 4 am watching glee. I introduced it to him! Anyway I fell asleep on his bed during one episode and when I woke up he was in the bed with me
I remember I was wearing my Boy Scout pants that night but I forget what shirt I was wearing
That lady gaga poster in Connolly's room? He gave that to me for Christmas that same night
Ok I'm done, sorry
No go on if you have more
It's just really strange how I used to gush over him and now you're the only person I think about
Nah it's okay
Omg okay we used to talk about how we would adopt two children
One girl and one boy. The girl's name would be Aida Evelyn Nakajima-Jones
And the boy would be Charles
And that for our wedding we would rent out Times Square hahahahahaah
He told me if we got married our last name would be Nakajima-Jones and he would drop Granzier because he hates his dad
Okay now I'm completely done 
Hahaha rent out Times Square.
Charles would have such a strange mix of ethnicities for such a proper name. A Latino-Asian (1/4 white) boy named Charles
I like Aida tho
Isn't there an Aida at our school? Like in the grade below you
Oh actually
Just occurred to me that the kids would not be biological
I'm dumb
Yes Aida Flores
And yeah I was waiting for you to figure that out haha
Idk scientific advancement
I'll be able to give birth in about 26 years
Out your butt
It would be a big poop
Pretty sure it would entail test tube babies and a surrogate mother
I used to think women gave birth out of their belly buttons 
I also thought everyone was gay
Lol what
Explain the second statement
I was five and I liked boys so I thought every boy secretly likes boys just like I did
Also it would fill me with joy to think about only boys being together and all the girls were single
I was such a strange child
Once I called 911 and left the phone behind a shed lol
the phone was gone the next week!
I thought that
Sex was like awkward and embarrassing and no joy
And so a couple that wanted kids
Would do it like once
Locked in a bathroom with their eyes closed
Which to be fair is true for some redneck teen moms
Think about how awkward it would be to be a teacher and seeing your students under "People You May Know"
lol I was told from day one that sex was better than eating cookies
My brother's dad drew pictures for me on a Trader Joe's paper bag
We were sitting in the trunk when I got the talk
Lol I haven't messaged him in like over a month
"I talk to so many people"
I never got the talk
Not even a little bit of a talk
Well it's true he does
Not by the other person's volition
But still
I hated the talk. I was told, "there are going to be boys who will want to touch your butt" 
IF ONLY HE KNEW I WAS ONE OF THOSE BOYS HAHAHAH :)
I.... I think he knew
Do you want to touch my butt
No he honestly didn't know. I tried coming out to him in 9th and he accused me of lying 
I actually really want to touch your butt :(
Eww
That's what got me off during my shower lol
Oh I'll send butt pics next time then
Really! I'm gaping
Haha 
Aren't you going to sleep now 
Soon yeah
HAHhaha A+
Would you fuck a pie
Like just to see
How it felt
Ok I need to describe another tumblr thing to you
If you love fetus so much why don't you kiss this one!
Revolutionary.
That sounds slightly appealing... 
One thing I do want to try is that glazed donut.
There is this tumblr for homeless trans people to get couches, and some of them are so fucking useless and not contributions to society it is so pathetic. But that is besides the point. Each post talks about such dumb things, like whether it accommodates wheelchairs and whether people who are sex workers can be safe and work there. One post was a chick bitching about how she lives in Iowa because she had been to big cities and they would not accommodate her hearing disability adequately in the dicaid system. Literally leeching off of the government 150%
Lol you should just do it
And say how it is
But you CANNOT eat the donut after ok
Can you tell me the blog name? Also what does that have to do with the fact that it's a blog dedicated to getting homeless trans people couches? Seems irrelevant.
Maybe we can try that some night and you'll eat the donut 
Also that sounds like something I would do, eat the donut.
It is about couch surfing not literal couches? Like people offering temporary housing. I will find the link
I was thinking about it before you said that
And I would eat the don't
Donut
Tbh I put your dick in my mouth
And donut tastes better than dick and all it touched was dick so why not
Wow I feel stupid. That text makes much more sense now hahaha.
But not if you came on it cos it would be soggy
Sex workers wtf
I knew you would not get that I just sensed it
"Yeah, you can definitely run your cocaine deals here"
Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll accidentally bite my dick
Like when I'm touching you in afraid I'll make you laugh and then you'll bite it
*I'm afraid
Have I ever accidentally done that?
Not yet :)
Btw the balls feels amazing
That's one of my favorite things ever
What is the best thing I can do with them, I feel like I do not know what to do
Ok this is going to sound weird but like grasping one ball with your lips
And repeating with the other
It's more the have couch that are funny but also some others
Ok
I can do that!
Anything else?
I like what you do with the nipples lol
Necking also feels nice
זית
Olive?
!כן
Why olive?
It's just a cute word idk
Lol ok
Zayyit
What does it feel like when
Rotze is difficult for me to say
I take body shots off you
Hmm
Well do you mean how I feel sexually or physically or emotionally?
I meant physically, but all 3 are acceptable
And now desired
How desired?
I desire an explanation on all 3 fronts
Physically it feels like somebody is slightly tickling me haha
Sexually it feels like a lack thereof, even thought it's pretty much the point of body shots. 
Emotionally I feel like somebody is taking not even a shot's worth of alcohol off of my stomach and that I should not be condoning this wild behavior.
Jk about the last one. I don't feel anything.
I like taking them off of you rather than anybody else or having anybody take them off of me
That's more fun for me
You know the seniors were playing spin the bottle (I and few others stayed out) and I was thinking how weird it was and how we as a group would never do that
That game only works with strangers otherwise what's the point
See but it was just the seniors with no one else
Literally just people from my grade
They are so sexually frustrated lol
I think all of them just need to be laid more
Well didn't people go off for a threesome anyway
Did that end up happening
Lol that was a way different party
With a totally separate group of people
Mashehu
Remember in the room with reyna etc
What happened?
When we were talking in jest about having an orgy
I think it would be really funny if one of our smaller parties turned into a bisexual free for all
Like everyone is into everyone for one night likely due to drug consumption
That would be an interesting way for the night to unfold 
You're getting me excited
Lol?
Well because it sounds somewhat appealing
I suppose in the moment. I think it would be incredibly awkward in the morning
But we would be legends
I'll never forget Diviya and Bella making out
Haha I had forgotten about that
And then after they did that they made plans to go shopping together
Did they go?
Did Veris know?
I think so!
I don't think Veris would care
He didn't know haha
I think he would find it hot, secretly
Didn't he once say it was boner time or something?
Lol yes
He was so wasted
I don't find lesbians hot
I've tried watching lesbian porn and I just don't like it
 neither I think it is gross
Like a total turnoff
It doesn't seem like scissoring achieves much
clit is such a gross word.
What shall I call it instead
The knob
Piggle wiggler
Do you ever rub your knob against your pants?
Or your boxers?
Mm not really the anatomy does not work out
I was reading about people with vaginas who do
Apparently it's a thing
I read that too and I don't get how they do it
"People with vaginas"
I subconsciously did that and then I consciously noticed it and then left it
Lol but I thought yours was bigger than most
I remember you told me it would become like a little pinky and then you could use it for anal
I think I was unlucky in that respect. Actually I consider it lucky I don't want a gross elongated knob. I think in most it grows to be like 1-1.5 in
Wouldn't that hurt though
But mine is definitely not more than 1 cm
And it would hurt me for sure
Don't you ever just look at yourself down there
I do
Lol from time to time
That's how I figured out I still had stitches lol
How could you not look I mean damn
At first I thought you were saying that about yourself lol
But really I don't find my penis good-looking
In comparison to others it puts mine to shame and makes me feel ashamed 
Your penis is definitely far above average in looks
Especially the head
But also the shaft
I really like my butt this week
I've been obsessed with butts in general
Nice ones though, not cottage cheese.
You should study middle eastern butts
I'll do that this weekend ;)
Or maybe through some snapchats
I think mine is somewhat cottage cheese :((( I am going to work out sometime and get a nicer one
....
You have such a nice ass I really just like looking at it
This is embarrassing
But I'm getting hard now :(
Hahaha
It's really not difficult to turn guys on
And for that I am thankful
It's so cute
And also really flattering
When I go to touch and you are hard even before I have done much
And your dick is so thick it feels really nice in my hand
Or like when I'm wet before we've even started doing anything 
I really enjoy watching movies with our hands down each other's boxers
 too
But my mind is on you really and not so much the movie
At least we go back to the parts we missed like with Say Anything hahah
Goodness I really just want to be with you right now
When we have the movie night
Can you wear sweatpants
Or just wear them more in general lol when we go out
It is so hot
in public?!
And sure! I love sweatpants. Dick outlines in sweatpants look so good
I like when you wear tight boxers
Yeah in public! Well not to like a nice place but if we are just hanging why not? Lots of people wear sweatpants
What about briefs? What is idea lol
Ideal
I like it when you wear tight boxer briefs, but also boxers are cool too w dick slips
And how you can have a boner sticking a mile out in boxers 
When I wore baby underwear my butt looked so nice and my boner just flung right out
I'll wear sweatpants to the next event we have!
Boner flinging <3
"Dick slips" you know they're so annoying because when I use the urinal to go pee my dick can't even fit through them
I earlier meant what underwear do you like best on me
It's too big :(
:)
I have to move around just to get it through when I'm hard
Which is quite often
Oh! I'll send a pic
Lol I know, I hope it doesn't hurt when I'm trying to get them out of your jeans
Yesss
Lol nothing left to the imagination there
Jk. But I like those tight and short boxer briefs you wear
I love when you're just walking around in them it's such a turn on 
Like these minus the print:
Oh the pink ones?
Like the American eagle ones?
You have pink boxers?!
Yeah like hot pink
You must show me next time
I do not wear them very often because they are really nice so I don't want to wear them out
Haha ok
Lol oh yeah better not get any semen on them
So I guess never mind 
Hahaha
Ok I am going to sleep, but I hope you have a nice jerk off session if you so wish
You just want pictures don't you
And you should send a pic of the results if you do so
Read my mind bish
I CALLED IT
Good night habibi bibti bibi
Good night 
Bibi Netanyahu
 
Whoaa
fog this morning. We can't see anything!
I just think it's really pretty. I'm done though.
It is really pretty. You should snap some pics from the school if there is fog there
Also, you are totally gonna be late, no?
Yes! I'll do that
Lol yeah... But that's nothing new.
Billings has started saying "it's nice to have you in class today" because I rarely ever see her.
I just always miss first period.
Is it somewhat intentional
I mean really is not that difficult to leave a couple minutes earlier
Never got how people are late every damn day
Ok well this morning my grandpa got home late from taking Richie to school
It's only intentional sometimes
and I mean it's not like she's lecturing because we do independent study
With my mom back though I don't think I will be late 
Why are you driving with Jay?!?
Just to hang out bc we don't have much homework now that seminar is over
What's up
How was your day
My day was pretty alright! The bad news is that I have a whole lot of coverings still on my chest for at least 2 weeks so you can't see much and what you can is all bruised 
And I had corn ice cream
But
The sweater looks gr8
For some reason my phone is being weird?
It says you are texting me from your phone now instead of email address
Rent is great I will watch it again soon
To be fair he has a point
I could not stop if I wanted
Unless I was with a roommate 24/7 with no Internet connection
Is it ok now?
The last text where you said it should be from phone was from email and this one is from phone
Well he has a point but that's after long term use, no?
Can you tell me if it's working?
Is it from my number
Lol I could stop whenever I want.
It is from your nimber
I don't really watch it. I usually just look at the collection I have of you.
Mm idk I was hooked from the first time
Hahaha well that somewhat counts as porn too
Okay cool! I don't consider it porn since I get the same thing in person hahah.
Although I guess I do take time to admire
I feel like if I did that in person you would be weirded out, also I you're in somewhat of a hurry
That video got provocative pretty quickly lol
Are you working?
Hey
The pictures from the book are so beautiful and simple and minimalistic, I love it.
I've always found handkerchief culture fascinating
Also I think in this day and age there will never be an intellectual setting where people don't take offense to something 
How was your day
Wow!!
Congratulations!!
You know, that is a HUGE deal for colleges!!
And it probably means a free ride to U of A
I think it is so cool, those pics and descriptions
I find the 70's/80's gay culture fascinating 
I was reaaaaaally surprised to receive that email, but yeah, I think I'll apply.
Yes! The men were so attractive
Also the Lavender scare, that's interesting to me.
But you know when you write a paper about something and it exhausts your curiosity for the topic?
It's not even a hard application!
Just put in your future personal statement, and fill some forms. Easy peasy
Yeah... I have had that happen many times
Are you speaking from experience w the national merit applications? The email says reg deadline is July but the reg website says June... 
Aimee! Today Reyna and Diviya and I were talking about our lives and relationships, and I had mentioned that you weren't one to really express how you feel
And Reyna and Diviya were telling me all of these things that you told them about me lol
But they were very nice, caring comments 
Like what? I do not recall anything specific haha
Btw!
The amherst fly in form
Is so funny
It begins with an alcohol policy
The policy says that the college-sponsored parties may have alcohol but underage will not be allowed but that in non-college sponsored events it is not their problem
"We encourage you to seek non-alcoholic beverages, which shall be equally accessible if you do attend a party" 
Then they have the important phone numbers and signatures part. The whole form is alcohol and signatures
Hi sorry I just got home from a scout thing
Hahahahaha
I love how that is their biggest liability rather than something like abuse
"We encourage you to seek"
Ummmm
I want to watch "Her" again
It was so goddamn pretty 
Things like you think I'm attractive, you really like me, I make you laugh, you enjoy being around me, you don't know how to make me happy or express these feelings to me
And I mean while I already know these things (who doesn't think them about me?) it's nice to hear
Makes me feel happy
Really? Is it THAAAT pretty or is it just Joaquin Phoenix's eyes?
I had my mom let me leave early from scouts bc Boy Scout boy was there and I was overcome by this this state of depression for no reason and I was also tired
I really love the colors. But also his eyes. And Scarlett's voice, and how romantic it all is (even if in a creepy way)
:;
:(
What happened to him?
I've been watching house of cards at it is damn good
And*
Maybe I'll watch Her this week. Maybe I'll watch her this week... ;)
Everyone is watching that show too. It's probably time for me to get back into tv shows.
He isn't ASPL anymore and he can't go to an event without his parents lol.
Who is she?
Yes haha I know that website
I like movies more and I feel a bit guilty because I think TV is lesser but in terms of relevant and specific social commentary to today.. It's so good
Like not even the meetings?
Well, I like the website haha. I'm going to use it from now on. 
With tv shows I feel obligated to continue watching and then if I don't finish a season I feel like a failure. But yeah, I totally agree. Also after a few seasons the show usually gets sloppy and repetitive.
Can you believe glee is over!
No idea haha, I didn't ask about the technicalities 
Down Home Town - ELO
Poker - ELO
I feel that way about glee
I feel obligated to go back and finish it some day
Kind of like how you have to listen to the new lady gaga albums
There is this restaurant I want to go to called the parish
You like those two songs?
Maybe we should have a glee marathon day and spend all day with a bunch of snacks and shit
I left off in New York :(
Or we could start from season 1 lol
I looked at the parish menu and holy shit it looks so good
The big hippie burger and the fries
If I could eat shellfish I would enjoy it a lot more
Also live music every Friday!
It is soooooo long though! Literally we would need a full day per season, they are each like 16 hours
Yes I love those two songs. Actually, the whole Face the Music album is great. 'Waterfall'
I watched how to marry a millionaire, and I loved it
Who cares lol? Let's do it
We should go on a Friday!
I WANT TO SEE THAT
But not for the next two Fridays lol I have work
is Marilyn a good actress
Okay haha let me know when
And the Friday after that I am busy too with a show at school
Maybe lets not go on a Friday
It was my first Marilyn movie and I must say that
She didn't shine because she wasn't the lead
She was fine, nothing really special
Beautiful of course
But she was dominated by Lauren Bacall
Who was brilliant
I think it wasn't her acting but the character was weak
I just wanna try southern food
You know what, I'm going to watch it right now lol. I don't have much homework left to do.
Lauren Bacall was in Howl's Moving Castle!
She only died last year
I vaguely remember that she died and I had only vaguely heard of her
It was damn funny
And sooo stereotypy
My friend who lives in Austin tells me the Tex-x food from the street carts are to die for 
Did you ever see that SJW thing I sent last night
The black thing?
It was fucked up on all sides 
Mm I just wish I had the ability to eat out more and have more variety
I love trying new food
No no, not the black thing
I wish I had more money to try new food lol
We're going to Zemam's next, yeah?
Ohhhh yes
I did read those
Same
Yeah sure
The people can't speak Spanish one was the worst IMO
like, then white people can't even accommodate other, literally it would be oppressive if no white people spoke Spanish in this country
Sí señor?
¿?
I thought all of the comments were ignorant, but the one that stood out to me the most was the "straight and white" teeth.
Sí mijito
Ya se
I feel offended that people in other countries want to learn English...
It's rather nauseating
I think many of them are parodies
Or really smart people who use this to bring down the SJW cause intentionally
Or maybe people are just that ridiculous
Or maybe it's a small cadre of mentally ill bitches
Were you the one who told me about the person who said the police dispatcher should not use pronouns when addressing victims?
You'd be surprised how many rants these people post. They just don't get much attention but they are very persistent about it.
Anyway I'm going to assume it was you. So I told Annika about that and she was totally on the side of the person and said that we need to stop using pronouns altogether because it's segregation.
Yeah I think it was me
How is that segregation
You're explicitly categorizing people based on the one word and are thus associating them with whatever preset connotations come with the use of the pronoun
Just by using that one word over the phone
The mango carrot juice bar sounds awesome
Excuse me ma'am
Ma'am what is your emergency
Oh I thought she meant
At all, like in society 
No more pronouns period
She is also for that...
Both her and Aaron
Is aaron one of these types too?
Yeah I mean he's friends with Panteha
We don't get any work done in physics because we are always arguing about shit Annika says and I always look like some insensitive asshole
Nightrider - ELO
so thaaaaats what you're doing
Thank you
It's been forever
 One thing I do agree with
And this is not over the phone but in person 
If someone is pretty androgynous, and you are a cashier or something, don't make a decision either way and say sir or ma'am, and don't ask them their pronouns, just the subject altogether 
I'm glad you like ELO haha. I only really like Livin Thing and Mr Blue Sky. Why did you look into them
Just avoid the subject *
Of course one should never assume when it's not that obvious, but I think if somebody is overtly displaying a female/male exterior then it's not wrong of me to use the presumed pronoun, until I'm told otherwise.
Aaron gave me his Face The Music vinyl and I've been listening to ELO ever since
So basically a week lol
Do you have clothes on yet
No no no of course, I agree. Just like if someone is clearly female body but is obviously trying to look masculine don't "ma'am"
Or vice versa
:)
Maybe it's shower time for me
But I just...
I need help
I forgot how to take off my clothes
What comes off first?
Ask your mom :)
Great idea!
First the socks
Oh so just my socks
Okay
Then the hat
What if I'm wearing a headscarf? :(
Wouldn't be surprised
You know
Did I tell you about the time I was harassed by a drag queen in a burqa
Well when he harassed me he didn't have the burqa on but when I walked back he did
Next: eyebrows
Hot look
Turquoise 
Das offensive!
Lol so you technically can't say you were attacked by a drag queen in burqa
No :(
Next: eyebrows?
Take off my eyebrows
Idk you interpret
I challenge you
To PALM
and left collar bone
Damn look at that hairy arm
My arm is hair?
Your arm has hair
So when do I finish undressing hmmm
Next is 
Glasses
Ok I think next is pants
Hmm 
Zipper maybe
Oooh im in pajamas
I've got a bitten
Button
Shirt
That's more than a button! That's a penis!!!!
:O how dare you
It just popped out I'm sorry!
You got da bitch biceps 
Ok I'm done
What?
Jk lol.
Sorry for trying to be hot
I'm joking
Now where is the popper now 
#rockhardcock
You don't like ass pics, right
Do ones from side, ass n the rest
That was a crazy cumshot
That was loaaaads of fun
How do you feel
Pretty good but
I can't jerk off in bath so that was sad
Why not!!??
Not enough friction
Well bubby, at least you tried. That's all that matters.
So much for watching a movie tonight 
But we haven't had aimee Sergio sexy snap time in a while
Yes I was planned to watch all about eve but that didn't happen either
Are you going to sleep soon?
Yeh, now in fact
Good night
Alrighty then
Goodnight
We should go to the desert botanical garden in Phoenix
Do you want to go to the coffee house tonight
(Black crown)
We could play a board game and maybe watch a movie
Sure! I'm getting picked up early today. What time?
I also want to go to the botanical garden in Phoenix lol.
*in tucson 
Because I've never been
I should be home around 4:30
Ok. Maybe 6? It would be fun if Reyna came again! But it would be great alone too
Or maybe a board game with someone and a movie alone
Mmmm so you want me to invite someone else?
Well I was thinking maybe for a bit, and then later on it could be just us? I mean we would have better opportunities on a day that's not a school night. 
Up to you
Better opportunities to do what?
I don't know who would be able to go.
To have more time and have an actual date
But alright if that's so it will be just us!
?
Well I haven't asked anyone yet but if you want me to then I can
No, no I just anticipated some response
Sorry, I was downloading these new apps
I will tell you about them
There's this one called dictator and I'm going to start playing now
Lol I have played that
It sounded so fun but it wasn't
That was a waste of time
Right
Maybe if they had different countries with personalities and dynamics similar to the actual country
What the fuck
It's not fun. It's mindless and hard and wtf
So much potential 
I was overthrown because of insufficient funds and there was no revenue from the things I was building sooooo how was I able to earn money?
No idea
Also the scenarios are stupid
Especially the oligarchy ones
Do you know any fun games
Not really :(
Computer games...
Like civ 5 omf
#MacProbz
If I wanted to play games I would end up breaking my trackpad
All is available on there lol, I use a trackpad only
Except like First person shooters
I thought we were doing 6:30 anyway?
Oh, I thought 6. Ok
Sure, but the Mac trackpad is very fragile
I recently got mine fixed because it sunk in from clicking too hard
Oh, that's strange for such an expensive laptop goddamn
Macs are such a joke!
Does your laptop have a cd thing
You can tap it and it dents lol
The older models were much more sturdy
No 😭😭😭 it cost more money than the one with the CD player too!!!!!!!
Isn't that true for everything
All for fucking retina display
I would never buy a Mac if I wasn't Rick
Rich..
Like if I had the $ to keep a real computer at home I might buy one but otherwise
Well it wasn't even a financial burden for us, like we were perfectly capable of paying it off.
Honestly it was all for the brand name
Yeah but to me it is inferior
Like that's why we got it
I would need a better, real computer at home to have serious applications
Yeah, I think that's why all do
The people who use it for spotify, tumblr and Netflix have few problems
I think the desktop macs are pretty cool though and they come with pages and numbers and Keynote and iMovie and GarageBand. Mine only has the last two.
I downloaded league of legends once but it was too difficult to play with the trackpad
Yeah no those are functional 
My computer is only used for spotify and FB and Netflix and email
Still overpriced but at least not lacking in ability
One legit argument is that Mac is lighter and has better battery life
They are functional and sleek, I really like the desktop ones.
The battery is impressive
Compared to a lot of windows computers
I only thought the first one was interesting
Yeah I think it's difficult
I think it really depends on context which we aren't given enough of
And really the sex offenders list shouldn't be for things like this. It is a lifetime blacklist. The guy doesn't deserve it
Ok I will be down in 10...ish
Depends on traffic
bb i am hurr
🎈🐢
Good night Aimee, I had the best time!
Sweet dreams
Earthling - Jobrianth
"One never knows when the homosexual is about" I can't believe this was shown in schools. It's so dehumanizing. All I can say is that I'm glad this stigma is not as present anymore.
I'll watch the Vimeo one soon
There's an article to go with the vimeo if you want it
the video is about a gay gang called check it in DC
You should send it!
I thought you were just going to haha
Are you working tonight? Or did you work today?
Worked today. Will work tomorrow night but not tonight
Oh okay
Why?
Just wondering
Interesting specialization, the fashion industry! Like of all causes.
Or things to do in general
You know, the gays and all
What's up
Yes, the gays and all! When I was really into art and I was drawing all the time I wanted to be a fashion designer. I have these really shitty designs in my sketchbook. :(
I was going to suggest we go out again but I didn't want to be too annoying and pushy
I am finishing up dinner. And you? How was your day?
I still want to be a fashion designing Brock star gaga :P
Oh no, that would have been great, you should have
My day was fine, I got a lot done
I had 700 pages of cues to go through at the start of the day and now only 400 so I consider that progress
So then do you want to go out tonight?
It's too late now-- I need to book travel plans tonight to send to amherst, unfortunately, and that will take time 
:(
Ughhhhhhhhhh okay haha
That is a lot of cues, holy damn. Do you think you'll be ready by the time we see the show? :P
Did you know (probably not) that Nathaniel asked Diviya to prom today in front of the entire school over the speaker 
And then patty called her down and Diviya said yes
I realized this morning that I actually am only going on on Sunday. And anyway it only took 2 hours to do that, I will finish tomorrow before the evening. It's only 400 or so cues, many of the pages don't have any
So she's been in this prom mood ever since
Yes she texted me lol
God that is something amanda would allow only if Diviya was involved haha
What do the travel plans consist of? Is it basically your itinerary or is it like tax stuff?
Well I am going Sunday's
*sunday!
I think Nathaniel had this master plan the whole time and that's why he joined prom committee hahaha.
Amanda probably didn't know 
they need a confirmation that I have a hotel, train etc. 
Awwww fuck
Then don't try to go out with me afterwards because I will be all torn up
Hahaha
Omg I didn't get any of these messages until now
I didn't get that Jew dinner one either
Train!! Is this going to be your first time on a train?
Hahaha actually it's jen's birthday night so we are having a sleepover 
But I'll make sure to see you before we leave
I'm watching this startling documentary about 9/11 that is very physics based
Do you ever worry about college ruining you?
Haha no I have traveled in a train quite a bit over my life- most recently from LA to tucson
What is it called?
No not really. College ruining me? I don't understand
It is called 911: In Plane Site. Zayna suggested it to me and I was expecting something about racism and Islam but nooo. It's pretty much government secrets and conspiracy theories and "the truth"; maybe the government is behind it? Not very compelling evidence but it's interesting. 
Yes, like turn you into a pretentious asshole.
Or that you will succumb to hard liquor and drugs
Or you'll drop out
I try to avoid those conspiracy type things, it's all nonsense.
Not surprised Zayna should enjoy it
No I am not worried of that lol
I am worried my grades won't be high enough
It's neither truth nor good fiction so I don't waste my time with it. 
But if you like it in the same way I like honey boo boo that's alright 
Just don't get it into your head
It was SUCH a waste of time. The man basically said that it was a plot by the U.S. to start the war on terror and get money. 
Not high enough to get into med school?
Whaat I didnt know you knew honey boo boo
I thought you weren't into the reality tv show stuff
Well yes, for med school. But the implicit fear is that I won't be a strong student there- below average. I don't know that I could stomach it. 
Not anymore really but from time to time
The first all nighter I ever pulled I watched toddlers in tiaras all night
Given, I was like 12 or 14
13
I am watching fight club and it isn't what I expected
I really think basis places this false mentality into our heads that we are better than everyone else and that we are more intelligent than everyone else.
That's a legitimate concern for you to not feel like you will stand out
Well, when I get into the same school Larissa does...
That's more respectable than me pulling all nighters to watch Keeping up w Kardashians last year... Literally did no hw at all
I would come home, watch the show, sleep, wake up, repeat.
I'm watching Gentlemen Prefer Blondes :)
All about eve turned out to be gripping
But kinda long
Tell me how that is
I wonder where Madeline Ness is going... She is the biggest cheater I know.
I'll watch that next!
Even though I have made many commitments to watch other movies hahah
Why isn't fight club what you expected?
It's about a guy who goes to support groups so far...
Eh it doesn't have to be at the top of your list, just somewhere
It is like showgirls if showgirls was good, PG, and took place in 1950 in NYC
Ah, starting out with a character flaw. I always imagined it was about some club seeping with testosterone where strong men fight or something. 
Is like water for chocolate on your list
Right that is what I thought. He goes to support groups for things he doesn't have because he has insomnia and it helps him to open up
I'll add 
Are you coming to the school at all this week?
How far in are you? You know, I think Monroe's voice is annoying lol.
Also she calls her fiancé daddy and it gets irritating really fast  
Apparently it was a Broadway musical before the movie
I am reading some critical analysis of all about eve and they say it is a bit ridiculous
Yes I'll be in on Friday
I am like 30 min into fight club
Her voice is sooo annoying she is like the prototypical dumb blonde
Question: why do you think we enjoy watching movies from the 1900s? What do you think it means psychologically
I've been thinking about this for a while 
?
Like I don't like a lot of the perceptions and ignorance of the time but I wish I lived then
You know?
I think the older movies are closer to our reality, they don't rely on things so out there like most of the movies these days
Life seemed very simple
Sure but it is interesting anthropologically to be able to step into that time in a completely authentic way 
And I don't think we judge them that way- that they are ignorant or whatever. It isn't even like theatre, that someone is making a choice to retain the ignorance written in another time. 
I find myself talking differently after watching these films
And it is funny to hear the high society american accent that is dead today
Fuck, I want to take a film culture and evolution of film class sooooo bad. That's going to be a lot of fun. 
I find myself talking and acting differently after certain films too. Another thing, I love hearing references to gender dynamics in older films hahah. Very strong in Rear Window. 
I feel like their speech is really proper and it's how I aspire to be
Lol I was reading the analysis of all about Eve as I said, and despite nothing to actually suggest it, they all assume Eve is a lesbian because she uses guys and is ambitious
It's funny
There are a bunch of articles about frozen and how it's all about a pro-lesbian agenda since there is no Prince, and she is fiercely independent.
Do you know any old gay movies
You are so cute!
Do you know when obesity started to become a big problem
The boys in the band!
In fact though
There is a great and famous book called the celluloid closet, by Vito Russo
And it is about gay representation in film, it is from the 80's so yeah
Yes I have seen those dumb things about frozen
Obesity has always been a "big" problem. (Pun)
I would say 1980 though, idk
I think it was around then
Good night
Oh yeah, you showed me Boys in the band last night. I'll add that one to my list too. 
:(
Okay well, goodnight.
If I could take a class in gay history I would do it
You'll probably have the opportunity to attend some gay history seminar or lecture
The common waxbill
Have a good day, hamudi 😘😘😘
Where is that bird from
Today I went to utterback middle achool 
School
The bird is native to sub-saharan Africa
Why'd you go there??
ATC did a teaching follow up there today
It was a bit scary
The school cop literally said "it's been a good day, haven't had any arrests yet"
I ended up not having work tonight so what's up w you
I was going to ask you the same! We can do something if you want but I want to do a bit of hw
OK. How long would that take
Well I meant like while we were out but I can work before then?
I'll let you know if that's not a viable option though
No that's fine 
What's the plan
You mean what are we doing or what time?
Both
I want you to make the plan tonight
Can we egg the school?
Totes
Hey when you have the opportunity 
If you could go through your watch list and count how many have a female protagonist, doesn't have to be now, or soon, that would be cool
Okay well when you pick me up I'll give you the address to where we are going
I'll say 7:30
Of course! May I ask why? Haha
Idk, I realized that it is a huge underrepresentation (22.6% of movies I watched have female leads). I was curious if that degree of skew was a result of my movie choice or the industry in general 
K!
Oh yeah that really bothered me, especially around the whole family. My favorite scene was when the mom got on the cousins' ass though.
Hey
As a traffic study lol. What is the concluded political incentive behind the closing? Overall it just seems like a huge inconvenience even if you want to use it as a political advantage
Did Shirley MacLaine even write risqué novels
What were some criticisms of your presentation
I heard Bryce's was great
I think the point was to piss the mayor off because he did something to upset mr. Christie? Yeah it's pretty weak, idk. 
But the fact that there are emails supporting this is the clincher 
No idea. there was a reference to it in world goes round too.
Why do you ask?
Well basically that it was lacking in direction (true)
Hey sorry b
It was kinda strange bc when you came up Nathaniel and I just came back from talking about how Diviya broke up w him and he almost cried
Yeah the article didn't provide much context and it kept wavering between a traffic experiment and then not a traffic experiment and it was hard to follow
But then yes, the emails
Because each time I listen to Arthur in Afternoon and I don't get the reference because I don't think it's what she's widely known for
What is your conclusion for your SRP?
You look so happy
Oh shit really
That was unexpected
God that was an unlucky moment to walk in
No, no. They said it was a traffic experiment as cover
That was a lie
Eh there isn't really a conclusion. Shit's fucked
Diviya and Nate were both going to go to Oregon and when Nate was asking for a letter of rec Mathews asked if they were together. So nate said yes and then Mathews told him that he had to notify the camp about this.
Diviya got upset and now refuses to go
She also broke up with him and said she would continue things in the summer
Her rationale is that the label creates complications
But nate doesn't understand this and thinks it's very irrational and he was super pissed off, which I understand
I've started watching heartbeats and its terribly tedious
That's such a Diviya thing to do :(, it is irrational. I hope he can weather this, and they end up back together in the summer. Cos this was a real fuck up on her part.
I keep remembering that I'm doing the end of year project. It seems unreal to be going back to school for a whole week at this point. I feel like I graduated long ago 
What don't you like about it
He refused to just be friends with her because it's either all or nothing. She said she's willing to start things back up in June, even though she is leaving for two months.
Hahah you know that you don't have to show up for projects if you don't want to
On my last day of APs we should celebrate
And go eat somewhere cool
And maybe do a movie sleepover
Well like a lot of the scenes that are supposed to be "artistic" are too abundant that it just annoys me
I'm still going to finish it
When you come back to the school for meetings and stuff do you feel like a graduate?
Would it be just us then? Or us and Diviya and Reyna or something if not Nate for a movie
Not even a graduate, just detached
Lol I'm gonna do it, not like I have ANYTHING better to do... Like really.
We can do one with just us or we can invite Reyna and James. Hopefully Diviya and nate work things out. They were both texting me their problems :/ these situations frustrate me and I don't think it's my place
Ummmm.....
rcedes: can we do something a little more... Black?
Kurt: I agree, we do an awful lot of show tunes 
Rachel: it's Glee club, not crunk club
Canada needs some Ontario enhancement 
Omg james lol
That would be hilarious
Season 1 is so much wittier and better in terms of character development
Realistic that teens are bitches. Unrealistic that schuester is so fucking immature. 
Still, Blaine prevails. 
Anyway good night and good luck as studying continues
OKAY AIMEE
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!!! ❤️💕😘😊🌝🌙🌺💞💗
Eres great lol
A FUCKING MOUSE JUST RAN PAST ME AND BRUSHED MY FOOT IM GOING TO DIE IVE BEEN INFECTED OH WOE IS ME
Hahahah omg not even 
I ate this off brand otter pop and it tasted like garlic and then the second one tasted like medicine and then I realized the knives I had used to cut them open weren't clean... I'm so dumb, it took like 5 minutes for that to occur to me.
Hahah what is most surprising is that it made the entire otter pop taste like whatever you used the knife to cut earlier. Anyway, I need to die in quarantine because I'm going to die from that fucking rat ohhhhhh. 
What are you up to today? Have you thought about how you want to decorate your cap?
Guess Diviya and Nate are back together lol
Oh no, I gave up after a couple licks and threw two of them out
Also heartbeats was literally the way you explained it. There were some pretty scenes with cool lighting and the music and acting were cool but overall, the story was shit
Like the party the Greek god threw
Do you like Amy Winehouse?
Why the rat fear??
Really don't get it
Yeah, I'm doing that from 1-4. Haven't thought about it yet...
How predictable. Hopefully it won't be like V, where she did this and so they proceeded to really break up due to trust issues soon after
Greek god party?
Yes I love her. Do you? I remember where I was when I heard she died.
They're so vile and repulsive ugh. They have always freaked me out as a child.
Maybe put some Ivy leaves on it, since that would be most appropriate ;)
Ok but I doubt V really even liked her. I don't remember why they broke up exactly but her relationship w Nate is actually going places.
Yes, the main dude reminds me of a Greek god, especially after they had all of those flashes of the statues and stuff
I doubt she liked him
I think he liked her
That scene where he throws a party and they're all dancing. I thought that was beautiful
Yessss I love her too. I've been listening to her all of yesterday and today. Santana's version of Valerie is better tho
You should listen to Sleepless Night by Yoko Ono
Also Let  Count the Ways by her too
Hi
Sorry I was at the senior thing, just got back
Santana really did kill that song
I will check out the yoko
And that rat is terrifying
Hey, how'd it go? What did you do with your cap?
That's not our rat hahah. Just the image that I associate with rodents in general.
I just saw American Sniper
That was such a disgrace
I just put some brown paper on top
Lol
And some brown ribbon on the sides
Most put wildcats related stuff
Why didn't you like it
Where are you now? Nice photo
Well it is symbolic of something so I can't say you aren't creative lol
Yeah there were a bunch of caps and shirtless people on snapchat stories
Eric is going to UPenn #ivybuds
I just went for a run and then I sat on some bleachers for half an hour
So that will make for a total of 4 Ivy people
I had the entire middle school field to myself
I didn't like the way Iraqi life was portrayed and how they all had affiliations with terrorism.
And I think it was overall a disturbing movie
lol yes. The senior boys have no modesty. I saw so much unnecessary dick outline. They just kept pulling their pants up to extremes
And I hated his motive for joining the war. I think it is a pathetic excuse for an "American hero"
Which middle school
Sure but that is the point
It's a harsh criticism
And it portrays the war zones realistically. It isn't meant to be a portrait of the country as a whole
These areas are abandoned except for terrorists
Anyone who wants to keep their life and isn't affiliated with terror usually moves away
But yeah the guy is supposed to be seen as an average guy driven to be a psycho due to war
Average military guy
Because that is what the average military guy motive is. He ISNT a hero and that is the point
Who are the other 3 Ivy people and what schools?
True, but there was still that scene where a child is contemplating whether or no he should pick up the weapon and Kyle also contemplates killing him. Well from what I know about Clint Eastwood (in other war related films and conservative) and based on the ending of American Sniper I assumed that it wasn't a criticism, but that it was lauding Kyle for turning his life around and being a hero, which I found disgusting.
The school across the street. It was relaxing to listen to music and watch the sun set haha.
I don't get what is objectionable in that scene? He doesn't want to kill the kid at all, but once the kid is about to kill his teammates Kyle has to pull the trigger and is scarred by that.
Holly- Cornell
Parthib- Yale
Eric- UPenn 
Oh, what are you listening to
In glee when they actually perform valerie it is ruined because they make it a dance showcase- detracting from vocals. Wtf. It's at sectionals 
No, I'm saying that's how the Iraqis are portrayed. All of them - including the children - are terrorists to some extent. 
Weren't you upset or something because everyone was surprised you were going to an Ivy League? Like everyone didn't think you were that smart?
I listened to Amy Winehouse, some show tunes, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono
Also Lily Allen
Because that's the zone they are in..
Innocent people don't stay in war zones
I'm on episode 8 I think! But I did a lot of reading today. I started The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut and some book about a Latina girl in high school
Well yes, I understand now
I think if you are looking for objectionable things you will find them in all media. But I think you missed the mark on the message here
No one was surprised really... Only surprised that someone is going out of state after hearing u of a and asu all day
Which of the books did you prefer lol
Well I also got the general message but I was using that specific instance as an example
Is that literally where almost everyone is going? It's so fucked up because I remember years ago your grade wanted to get out and they all had their top colleges. 
I have to sign up for the ACT right now ughhhhhh
And then I have to take SAT subject tests but it keeps telling me there are no available dates??
There are some in June though. Idk what the problem is
I actually love Vonnegut. This Latina book is in diary format. The annoying kind though
Lol
Idk if you heard about that kid other students were paying to take their SAT a few years ago 
Last year I used to torture myself with YouTube videos parents made for their Harvard bound child
Fuck this line though: Scores didn't match up with GPAs 
Out of state: 
Sienna
Helena
Eric
Holly
Dominique
Elizabeth
Sarah
Hannah
Xochi
Larissa
Erica
Parthib
Steven
Jacob G.
Cerelia
Alex 
Robert
Charlotte
Miles
So over 1/3 going out of state, and I might have missed a few people. Not too shabby I think
How did you possibly assemble this list lol
I actually want to know
Please tell me the school doesn't post who is going where :(
Most off the top of my head and then I looked in yearbook. I just talked with a lot of people and they mentioned a lot of other people. 
they do at graduation 
The guy the friends are after in Heartbeats looks like the male version of lords 
*lorde
But some I am not sure about so it could be a few more
Why do you love Vonnegut
I like him too
Sign up for it in the fall if you can't June
Eh it happens all the time, SAT cheating 
Yeah fuck that. Plenty of great GPA shit scores (Helena) and bad GPA great scores (Alex)
The black haired one?
He is sooooo cute
His futurist perspectives on the individual and the human condition and society in general are particularly interesting. 
lol Martha told me she went back and changed answers for her SAT
Aint that some crazy shit
Why do you like Vonnegut
What have you read?
It's just really sad that kids were willing to pay thousands of dollars for an SAT score.
I think dystopias are fun. I read only the short story Harrison Bergeron. 
Wow we should tell on her.
Why is that sad? 
Ah yes! Harrison Bergeron is some good shit
Lol then we'd also have to tell on a lot more students
Well that these tests mean so much to us and to colleges when they measure nothing
It's sad how dependent we are on them
Also I think that their score should just be their score and that they should make the best out of whatever college they get into 
"Ah yes, Harrison Bergeron is some good shit."
Quoth Herr Sergio
Mm I don't think they measure nothing. like at all. 
I think they measure some kind of ability. Almost never are we surprised at someone's scores. 
It is an equalizer. If you go to a shit school and get a good GPA despite not knowing anything, SAT exposes that. If you go to basis and have a crappy GPA but are actually pretty smart, it's just hard at basis, sat exposes that too.
Sure that's what they should do, but they want the prestige of a famous school to carry them to the business job they would have been qualified for anyway because they have connections, but needed the degree (that they cheated for) to be hired for. 
They are doing it because they know they aren't smart but they need the name brand for the career they have planned
That's what happens when careers that don't require superior knowledge require superior degrees 
I think about the SAT in the opposite way because ultimately it comes down to knowing your algebra 2 and some vocabulary words. I don't necessarily think it has much to do with intelligence or how smart you are except for the math portion of the test. It all depends on exposure, where the basis kids might do better because of the math and language arts emphasis. I say that because many basis kids just don't even study for it and do fine compared to the many tucson high kids I've met. 
Okay but where does one draw the line then? If we have all these constructs that affect college acceptance (grades, standardized testing, etc.) and people are cheating on everything then who is to say they will effective in their desired field? I just don't support it 
And I don't think you should try to rationalize that behavior
I think in theory it doesn't come down to ability (not saying intelligence. Ability is more knowledge-based). But in practice, when most people don't study, it does. 
It's not a large percentage that do this
I just don't get the SAT/ACT hate. I think they are VERY representative of what is trying to be measured -- college preparedness. 
People aren't cheating on everything. I am rationalizing the ideology of the group that cheats on SAT.
Or the most valid ideology of the group.
The SAT only directly measures those things you listed but
Really it's a matter of memory recall, critical thinking, and reading and writing ability and practice. Which is all very important for college. So in theory someone who really doesn't know shit could learn the specific required skills. But if you don't know shit you probably won't care to practice. For the vast majority of test takers it exposes the pre-existing knowledge and skills because they don't study (or don't study effectively).
I think it is popular to criticize the test but it usually just confirms what everyone who really knows the test-taker already knows about their ability. 
I mean yes in theory the test has major issues but in practice it really doesn't
Is that why you believe that SAT prep and retaking it won't significantly improve scores? You're right though. My only problem is about the people who just haven't been exposed to much and get low scores. It's a bit unfair that a shitty upbringing and education never gives them the opportunity to get accepted to a good college where they can develop those skills. 
Connolly gave this inspiring speech on Thursday about happiness. Basically from day one it was implied she would be a sociologist. Got good grades, got into a good college, got started on a very elite doctorate program.
If they have such shitty upbringing it would do them no good to go to a competitive college. They would be better off at a state school where they have a better chance at success. If you get a low SAT score for whatever reason, that is outside of the range for a college, you probably will not fit there academically. 
If we got rid of them and 3.8 students from sunnyside went to USC just like 3.8 students at basis do, they would just flunk out because it is way too high a jump 
Her boyfriend who came from a less affluent household told her she looked absolutely miserable. He suggested she reevaluate her decisions and think about what makes her happy. Connolly had two more years of her program paid for but she thought about it and then sent an email saying she wouldn't be returning
From there, her and the boyfriend went on a huge road trip and ended up buying a home with missing roof pieces in Kentucky.
They lived in one room with a roof and with a mini refrigerator. Boyfriend got a brain tumor and she had to come back to tucson.
Idk basically I thought it was just amazing how she decided what she really wanted. She was fine with her parents disappointment because it didn't matter
I've been wanting to share that because I found it really insightful 
And like I kept asking her questions about her happiness and how she developed this mindset.
It probably sounds so cliché and movie-like
I think basis needs to get it out of its head that u of a and Pcc aren't good schools for some people. It is the right fit for upward mobility for some people. If you come from a shitty background and want to succeed you need to take incremental steps. It's bad for basis kids but perfectly fine and great for others. So we need to not make a value judgment and feel sorry for them for going there, because that is what will give them the right push. It is just unfortunate that they come from lesser educational backgrounds.
That is a really great story. 
And it does sound cliché lol
I think basis needs to get any associations with failure in general out of its head. I hate how vocational schooling and specialization is viewed at the school.  
Well it's because it's not our track. Pretty sure many plumbers aren't in love with the Ivy League either. 
And like how Kristie said "now that I go to basis I just don't know how to talk to people from public schools"
Well I'm not in love with the Ivy League either
Ok sure but that's not the point...
And plenty of people you would expect to go to one have criticisms of them
I'm just saying that there is animosity between the groups. We look down on each other
Ok this really isn't about the ivies
Seminar kids literally spent a week tearing apart the Ivy League education. We even had Kordik come in and we talked to some of his Harvard friends
Well tell me the main points and I'll take them down lol
I'm saying we dislike vocational because that's what we aren't and we think we are superior but they probably feel the same way about their practical skills. 
Lol that's what jay said after he said discrimination doesn't really exist
Tell me the main points and I'll take them down
Actually I think we had the conversation the week I read the article
Jay and I are a lot alike in debate except that I stay inside the box and he throws away the box. 
Like you and I had the Ivy League discussion
I'll give you the article though
It's very short
Idek if you remember but it was basically that Ivy League schools train students for their professions where there are no rules and no deadlines
Ok that's not even true lol
That's more a criticism of the ivory tower
Of academia
And you said something about the guy being biased and jaded
Not of the Ivy League 
Also the Ivy League colleges foster this false sense of self-worth and smugness
Ivy League gets a lot of future businessmen, doctors, lawyers, politicians. tons of rules, tons of deadlines. Sure there are some sociologists, but those are not at all limited to ivies
Well it was that the Ivy League trains people for the upper class lifestyle
True for most/all universities I would say. But yes maybe a bit more for the ivies. But not only the ivies at all. UChicago, Stanford. Any good school really. If this is a criticism of highly ranked schools it should say that instead of ivies
"Professors at top research institutions are valued exclusively for the quality of their scholarly work; time spent on teaching is time lost. If students want a conversion experience, they're better off at a liberal arts college"
Less so about the upper class as years go on. True in the past, but today the low income enrollment is up and up. But really what does that mean? Training for upper class life. What does it involve? How do the Ivy students get specific training in this that other students don't? 
OK I HAVE A GOOD ANSWer to that one
The criticism was that those schools only teach analytical and rhetorical skills while liberal arts schools allow independent development 
That is factual at many schools. But you can't generalize ivies. Brown and Dartmouth in particular have undergraduate focus, and that is why I picked them. I think also Princeton. Not at all limited to ivies. State schools are soooo guilty of fucking over undergrads. U of A especially
Again, generalizing ivies. Dartmouth and Brown ARE liberal arts schools 
The article defines the Ivy League bestowed upper class lifestyle as rich and not really enjoying your job but enjoying the paycheck 
If this wants to be a criticism of Harvard and Yale it can be that but I don't know why it doesn't come out and say it.
It basically is a Harvard Yale criticism
Also Columbia
See brown again (I am most familiar with them but may be true for others). Brown is all about finding what you are into through open curriculum and pass/fail. Other than the economics department I would say Dartmouth is too. 
That is where the author has taught in the past
Yes Columbia, I forgot them.
But even harvard I really disagree with some points
Do you think the students at brown experience the inflated ego or have self-worth issues? I mean since basis kinda has that problem you might be oblivious to it
Because these schools are the leaders in most fields, they really allow you to explore whatever you want, because you are told you can succeed in whatever because you are the best. And so I don't think it's about the paycheck. 
Okay but the students who graduate from those schools are expected to get out more money than they put into it
When you are actually at the school, with all the other smart as fuck people you can't revel in your self worth because you are in competition with equals. But say after graduating or when off-campus, probably. But I think it's true at every step. Harvard thinks it is superior to brown, brown thinks that about USC, USC thinks that about u of a, u of a about Pcc, and Pcc about those without college. 
I think everyone on the educational ladder has inflated ego with regards to their "inferiors"
So I feel like exploring may be encouraged, but lucrative jobs are implicitly encouraged even more
There's always pressure
No... you miss my point 
The point is that you can succeed in anything, so pick what you love.
And those who pay a lot have a lot, and those that don't don't pay a lot
Well with how practical all the intellectuals are these days I'm sure they realize just how successful one can be as an artist
That is total bullshit
?
What is total bullshit
Success is always defined as income these days
If you are coming from that ideology I can see how you would misunderstand  my words.
It's evident even at a school like basis where we are encouraged to be successful wherever we go
Basis is a far step below a top college. Not comparable. What basis defines as successful and what a college defines as successful are so different
Maybe it's because I haven't attended any of those elite college presentations or even visited the school itself
So I just don't know how this works
Visiting the school is far more important
I don't know how I could have made an informed decision without visiting 
The information a website or presenter can give you is so inadequate. 
I'm so curious about the Ivy League and elite school dynamic 
Maybe I'll just visit to visit sometime next year
It's the people. A feel. A look. The connections. All the schools I looked at are great and an alright academic fit for me.
You should apply for those minority fly-ins
Seriously, just visiting a college on a tour or something is like 1/8 of it.
Still better than just a presentation 
But also don't go visit somewhere you really have no chance of getting in. It will just make you sad 
Unless it is for curiosity
I would be crushed if I had visited dartmouth earlier and not gotten in.
Actually I take that back. You probably would find it more interesting than emotional.
Lol I already know the type of school I can get into and where I'm likely to go
It would simply be an observation for me
Also, please please really think about whether you can handle a large school (12K+). It's like a city. 
Although I fucking wish I had done better in school earlier because I know I had so much potential
Fuck fuck fuck
That is my biggest regret
Transfers bitch
Seriously a ton of people like you do it 
Why wouldn't I be able to handle a large school? I kinda like the rural school community feel but then also the opportunities that come with a large school
Go to wherever. Do great. 
Ya that's probably what I'm gonna do 
*ipportunities w city
How does money work with transfers?
Well like its so anonymous. It's like a city. I think we take for granted the advantages of the small school. 
I'm not saying rural
I'm saying the 40K student school in NYC Versus 6K in LA. 
You need to apply again for fin. Aid
But you need to apply every year for it anyway so it's no different
But maybe it's time for a change. I often think about how nice it would be to see a different face every day.
Sure but 6000 is a new face a day
What is your preferable class size?
Probably 3K
Well here is some back story
I mean per class...
Oh ok nvm
Mmm 10-15
But I also want to know about the 3k
God, also, one thing I fucking hate is when parents try to rationalize their children's shitty behavior 
I have been thinking a lot about what it is we talk about. Why is it way harder to strike up an engaging and long and genuine conversation with a stranger than a basis student I've never really talked to. Shared experience. Knowing the same people, the same teachers, the same stories. If I was at a college that big they might as well all be strangers. My class would have nothing uniting it. No funny stories we all know, or horror stories we all know, or people we all know of. And if I personally know 300 faces I am way more likely to run into someone I know around campus at a smaller school. I would feel that I am among strangers rather than my peers, I think. 
Lol example?
A college that big = 40K = u of a
At 3K I think there is enough to keep it diverse and fresh without it becoming just a community of students. 
But I think brown and dartmouth are also decent sized (6K and 4K undergrads respectively)
Not very far on this yet, but good so far. It won a lot of awards 
Most downloaded episode of this american life ever
I think when I think so much about how conversation works it stifles my ability to converse lol
I think that's what I value so much about small classes and clubs. School population really doesn't matter to me all that much. When there is a small class then we are bound to get close and expand our friendships through others while sharing similar experiences. 
Example: every mother with a baby/toddler. Idk I've noticed this recently in a lot of mothers. My mom, the mom from this movie The Babadook
I'll listen to it tonight!
Lol same here. When I think about conversations in general and what to say next it exhausts me
When it gets to that point then I'm not interested anymore
What is so worthy of acclaim in this podcast?
that true. I think the part I left out is that most of the time big schools have big classes you know? And big clubs too. 
But you're right
Like how do they rationalize it
Well the premise of it is that
They spent 5 months in this high school where 29 current and recent student had been shot. 
And they reported their observations. And it's way different than what your vision would be of a school where that happens 
Yeah. I've never actually seen one of those huge lecture halls like in the movies but they sound dreadful hahah
I have. It's very real
And true for the very first introductory classes at great schools, and nearly all classes at others
Well they blame it on their age even though correcting the behavior is effective. My brother has been screaming at the neighbor's dogs and he complained to my grandpa. My mom got upset and said he has a right to scream because he is a child
That sounds great, I'll listen to it for sure
I think of the huge lecture halls as only useful for philosophy classes, not anything substantial 
29 students in one years. With a school of only 500. It's insane. Do it for sure
Lolzz
I mean maybe it's only useful for that. One thing I should add is that most have a big lecture and then smaller labs or discussion periods with TAs with under 30 people. 
It's used for everything. Astronomy, sociology, biology, economics, business. Maybe not english quite as much
That's really fucking awful. If something like that happened at BASIS there would be a deeper sense of fear, pain, and pretty much everything
actually I'm lying
I have in fact been in a lecture hall but it was probably 150-200 students and we were watching a film
So it wasn't too intimidating haha
Also nsfw with snaps
Bc ur the bae ❤️
Was this lecture hall, hmm, a movie theatre???
Jk
Thx bb
I mean I can send more
Hahahah no
Dooooo eet
You can continue if you desire but I finished, so I will be saving the art for tomorrow's viewing pleasure 
Finished prematurely I might add :(
Never as satisfying when that happens
NO!
The newest three are the best
I'll send more I promise
Also wow lol didn't help me out
Maybe you can send apathy nudes
I decided to move to a bed
Oh sorry I was almost asleep wasn't thinking
I will do so
Actually save them
But send some lol
I'm sorry!
Nice floral in the back
You should send a video
Like just to try it
Your thighs look so nice
Your abdomen looked very nice today
For some reason I felt really turned on by you
But like this not bc of the pictures
Lol I was gonna say "God forbid"
When we fuck is a lot of it cerebral for you? Like thinking in loops. Wondering if I'm alone like 
Lol*
That was beautiful
Yeah, but I'm thinking about how you're feeling
And I try to focus on how I feel
"He's loving my pulsing manmeat inside him"
Hahahahahahah
"It's nature's primal urge. I am man."
I really want to fuck you
Like right now
I really just want to grab you 
By the way
Like cup my hand under you
I decided that until I realize this is a dangerous idea I'm going to say yes to any request you have regarding sex
But also I'm gonna keep a lot more condoms on hand for round 2 lol.
;)
I'm so happy aimee 
Idk but I care about you so much
And like this might be the wrong time
And you might not care hahah
I'm really happy too
But I want you to know
And I do care
And I've had a really great conversation with you tonight
You are really becoming more interesting by the day. 
Hahah I swear I'll bring that article for you :)
I've also had a great conversation with you
Still you are a bit easily influenced in terms of your opinions on things, but it's nice to have someone open on the other hand. 
And like I think about you all the time
Wait which article
The article 'disadvantages of an elite education'
I just want you to read it
Oh right. Could you just send me the link lol? It's 2015 bruh
Lol somehow i knew you would say that
I was wondering if you would ask for a link
It's on JSTOR
But you've got $$$
 That's cool I have JSTOR
No way
Can I use your account sometime
Holy shit
Well, the whole senior class mooches off of holly
That would have been so helpful
And it expires in 6 days...
For my papers this year
Holy shit
And I don't actually have the password. It's just in my laptop already :(
But next year I'll give you my brown JSTOR info
Lol that's what my grade did with Trenton's APUSH quizlet sets
Wickedddddd
I'll send the link soon then
Also if anyone gets a U of A ID from summer work they probably have JSTOR
Not sure if Diviya got one last year but if she did that would have access
I would have died without JSTOR this year
How can you do a research paper on something obscure without it? So much wasted time.
I think Scottsdale has JSTOR for students :(
But anyway I am super tired so
I am gonna crash
So good night
Connolly let us use her account in 9th but nobody appreciates it back then hahah.
Alright!
Good night
<3
And I pity you for having to journey through the darkness that is research without JSTOR
We had EBSCO which is kinda tantamount 
Lots of cool middle eastern stuff for me. I spent hours on it
Next time we have sex I want a big giant slushie all over me. Slushie me. Let it seep through the threads of my boxer briefs. Then, I want you to take off my boxer briefs and wring them out over your mouth as you pant for slushie drops.
As long as you:
1. But slushie
2. Clean car
3. Bring a poncho
4. Put freshly laundered boxers on moments before this occurrence
Way to take all the fun out of it :(
After all this glee slushie business I think it would be fun to try it once
What Jay texted me at 1 am: "Oh my God I just walked in on my parents fucking. As if I didn't have enough reasons to joke about suicide."
Ok! I'll throw a slushie at you? Just keep your phone in your backpack when you are around me for the near future lol
Poor guy
What's crackalackin
What I got in the mail earlier this year
It's a sign.
You know they never sent me shit
Seriously, can you really do that though???
It was so sad. I was blowing my nose and I look over at this book shelf in the living room
I never got an email, or mail, or even when they sent the final acceptance packet it was like 2 pages.
Then I see this thing sticking out and I wondered if my mom hid it because it looked all fancy
And then I went over and saw it. It was my dream school last year and before you even told me about it and I hid it there in August maybe?
It was really depressing to see
Also wanted to go to Harvey Mudd
I'm going to do some calc and physics review today. Making a breakfast smoothie first haha. Then I'll work out later. Wbu?
**hid it in October. I remember getting it around PSAT time
Are you going to be a national Hispanic scholar
I'm watching glee lol
Half way through season 2 now
Hopefully I can finish season 3 by next weekend
Will you judge me if I'm drinking pulverized kale
Yes.
Hopefully! I have to turn in my application still but it's easy
:)
And due in June
What was your score?
And percentile
Lol that is insane. I am on episode 10 "Ballad". I was up until 2 last night watching glee
Ummm let me check
Pulverize- smash by beating
I tend to believe you used a blender. 
It would be damn hard to pulverize kale. 
Pulverize and blend have the same end result (a reduction to fine particles) but by different means. 
#sorryimbeinganivybitch
#sweeney
I got 93rd when I should have gotten 90th
Ahhhh thank you mister for your technical interpretations
What about liquified
I suppose. That sounds icky tho.
But that's ok bc liquid kale is icky imo
See ok that's a big plus
For your app
Plus the upward grade curve
If you match that with an sat of 2000 or act of 30
You could probably have a shot at Harvey mudd. That is, with a fantastic essay. 
I think Fulford undersold you 
That would be a far reach probably. But still a lot of good schools are a possibility. Like USC or something
UCLA, tufts, Berkeley, vassar, Wesleyan. All options, I would say.
Don't get down on yourself!
I'm taking both my SAT and ACT in June so I can dedicate time for those tests rather than having to do that on top of schoolwork 
Did you always have Ivy League ambition? And did you ever have another profession in mind besides doctor?
Hahaha thank you aimee
I'll look into those schools and probably add them to that list you saw on my desk hahah
Nope I hated the idea and didn't want to go Ivy ever. I wanted williams and amherst. But then $$$ happened and so yeah
But then I realized no normal people have heard of those schools and I wanted to be cool so I decided to apply to ivies. Jk
Hahah what changed? Why did you hate the idea?
And yes I wanted to do economics for a very long time
And then I wanted to be a researcher
Did you explain the change in interests to the colleges or did you make it sound like medicine was always your passion?
Neither
They didn't ask
I mean maybe like one did but it was a super short essay
What you want to study isn't very important for applications lol
So I just said I wanted to do that and the merits of it. Didn't imply one way or the other if it was a new or old passion
I hated the idea idk why. I had an image of them, basically what the article you read described. And I didn't want that.
But also small school size and rural areas were things I liked about williams and amherst.
And the close relationship with profs
Lack of greek life
And sports (was wrong about sports, it's so big at amherst)
Wtf is this video
I'm trying to expose my brother to culture and I'm having him do fun play dough experiments
We're listening to Simon and Garfunkel
And he sings with me
Lol I so apologize for my snap response 
Lol he is super overweight. My mom got him a bike today because he doesn't exercise
That guy is so irritating.
Also what if people just look up nigger to find out what it means
Like that doesn't necessarily determine racism
Oh nvm he's about to address that
Lol "Joann likes to search for nazi silverware"
Their attitudes are the funniest thing ever omg
"What else do you do in the mountains? You listen to rap"
But at least she is the most sensible bitch. Where did you find that?
This is super flawed. What a waste of money, producing this show.
Legit basis propaganda 
Omg the other math teacher looks just like swindle
Same outfit, facial and head hair
Wow
Fuck that video
WE LOVE OUR ADMINISTRATORS, THEY CARE
LOL
Eh it's not a waste of $ because I assure the show generates a ton of $
Childhood obesity is like the devil. Get on dat :(
The cherry picked statistics gotta love em
Like we get $150k in aid cos we apply to a fuckton of lesser schools. How much merit aid is eventually used... Probably just the $15K for the state schools.
the way they idealize the basis experience with their dramatic ass music and cinematography and the violins they throw around everywhere is unsettling. Also they really idealize the Ivy League life in this video. It's like they've totally neglected that "we want you guys to have sports and drama and extracurriculars" mantra to sell the AP oriented school experience. At least that's not a lie.
Lol idk who would waste their time with that stupidity
What were some tv shows you watched as a child?
Why is coastal life desirable
Yes I got the Ivy League thing too. But they didn't even have any students accepted to real ivies. 
Did you catch the kid with the perfect calculus score lol
I dunno. Personally, I like sizable living spaces, low cost, nature, and a lack of rich douchebags. Fuck me right?
Not a fan of the coasts
I watched kids next door
And really just everything on nick disney and Cartoon Network pre-2008
Drake and Josh
Icarly
Suite life
Wbu
Not a fan of courage the cowardly dog or Ed Edd n eddy
"Sometimes I think I should settle for Columbia or Dartmouth or some other college I know I could never be content with" what a bitch
You know, if I've learned anything, it's that the whole "you need to be perfect, and have a ton of community service and start a non-profit to get into an Ivy" is SUCH a lie
"Have fun in Providence! Maybe you can get your hair dreadlocked while you're there" I'm going to tell you that before you leave haha and after I take your Before picture. Each time you visit I'll take a picture of you to observe your transition into a drum circle semiotics major.
Yes lol that was so stupid. They chose kids with such random credentials, like the West Virginia girl too. 
I don't think she's saying that she's not content with the schools themselves. Rather, she has this deep desire to go to Harvard and she can't settle for any other great schools. She wants the "best".
Ivy or bust is so fucking pathetic. That is very unhealthy. Maybe you should write a blog to alleviate some tensions haha.
Where do you see yourself residing?
Those two Cartoon Network shows were stupid lol. Also courage freaked me out all the time. I watched the same shows but also Hannah Montana, Phil of the future, Lizzie McGuire
It's kinda strange because Zayna didn't grow up with any of that
THE PROUD FAMILY
Ed Edd N Eddy is how I envision frat boys and state university straight boys
It was UVA not West Virginia... One of the top 5 public universities....
I dunno... Maybe Washington or Oregon. 
Which is coastal I suppose :/ but has less of the symptoms
Courage made me so scared
I also watched the three disney shows you listed. In fact I have Phil's autograph somewhere
fuck I hated the proud family lol. I watched an episode a bit back and it is sooo stereotype. It is like enforcing that on children 
Still pretty funny
I think you would fare pretty well watching horror movies after seeing how you were during It Follows. Ever since that movie I have applied your attitude of horror movies to others and I don't find them scary anymore. Only the few jump scares.
I think the coastal situation you described earlier is more of a New England big city coastal problem.
How did you get his autograph?!!! Lol yes! There are so many attempts at not being racist by creating black protagonists but they only reinforce stereotypes and undermine the intent by perpetuating them. Raven didn't do it as much though. A very basic nuclear black family with realistic problems and not a lot of emphasis on their race and the accent. 
But like Suga Mama? Really...??
And the hairstyles oh god
Also a California problem
He was at a JCC event years ago for israeli Independence Day
I loved raven
That show was ridiculous tho
Eh his hair is what 2004 was, Ya know
What is my horror flick attitude?
I was actually thinking about it and I really liked that movie
Maybe not the zombie horror movies or horror actions movies but I could go for that type of shit
We have a Raven dvd and a lot of things were ridiculous but had great underlying messages. 
Like where you're able to deconstruct a lot of scenes and understand what the director is trying to do, and then you don't get scared like I do. That's what I did with The Babadook. But what do you mean by that type of movie? What did you find enjoyable about it?
I have jerked off every day since we last had sex
Ok you have to watch the trailer for this movie tangerine. I just saw it on the imdb front page cos it looked trashy and it was more than I could have expected!
Oh, yes, I do that. I mean the indie horror flicks, idk I liked it in a spring breakers kind of way. Can't describe
I have too! 
But that is not so unusual for me
The movie was shot on the iPhone 5s...
Lol the prostitution scene omg. It is trashy though but kinda enticing, you know? That was more reminiscent of indie action drama Spring Breakers than It Follows. We should see that together!
I've been thinking about the time we were outside and I got the blowjob and I had you against the car and I went in from the back 
Are you going to see the avengers?
Awww there's a Little Prince movie coming out with James Franco
Would it be uncomfortable for you to send a picture of full frontal
"I got the blowjob" you got the blowjob?? Wow, congratulations!!!
I can't imagine how a movie could sum up that book
I suppose I will see the movie... Why?
Wow you shaved everything
Not shaved just clipped
It will grow back soon lol. 
Lol idk if you've seen No Strings Attached but after they have sex Ashton Kutcher brings flowers to Portman's work and a balloon that says thanks for the sex
Well I feel socially obliged to see the movie so maybe we can go see it
Since the loft isn't having many good movies this month 
I feel the same way about avengers
Did you finish?
You left me hanging
I feel that way about all of these mainstream blockbuster films. I find obscure film showings much more exciting. It's kinda ridiculous how people get over those blockbuster films. Camping out and stuff lol.
Oh I didn't know you were doing it!
Sergio to the rescue
Where do you position yourself when you're in the bathroom
Btw I did finish hahah
Oh ok then I'll find other material. Thanks!
I'm sorry :(
No no it's fine
I finished. It was grand
I don't get the superhero obsession
All the superhero movies suck IMO
Seriously so boring
Are you studying tonight
My finish was grand as well. I was basically doing yoga in the bathroom, bending over as I finished. It was very nice. You never answered where you do it in the bathroom haha. Do you stand up?
Okay I was going to suggest we go out tonight
You're going to teach me all about the civil war hmmmm
I don't do it in the bathroom
Unlike lil Wayne
Maybe volume of a solid revolution too
Hahahah and unlike me too
I can't do it standing up though. Only lying down. And usually only with underwear on. I need to learn to diversify.... Or buy a pair of assless underwear
Like a jock strap
I want to get ice cream too. Ya?
At first I read that as headgear because I was only half looking hahah
I can teach you APUSH 
Like legit tho lol
Yeah sure we can get ice cream
You read what as headgear
lol I don't understand how people have trouble with history. If you actually study then it's not a problem. That's how it works for me.
Sometimes I get annoyed because people ask the most self evident questions 
I just listen to it like a story and so I never studied
Whenever I ask questions it's to evoke discussion and it's usually only between me and billings
Underwear as headgear
That was me last year. But they were just questions.
Questions for her that is
What do they ask
Ok like in the beginning of the year billings showed us a picture of an enslaved family. Then someone raised their hand and asked how the slaves had money to pay for the portrait. 
?????!!!!!!!!?!!?!
Or like 90% of Claire's questions
Wait that's a fine question.... I mean it exposes the purpose of the photography. Is it their own? Or for a journalist? Or what. 
At least it could be a good question with the correct intentions
My grade isn't full of superstars like yours was haha. Nobody expects them to jump through those logical hoops.
Your grade acts dumb
But I don't think they are actually dumb
The person was literally asking how the slaves paid for the portrait and billings gave this huge sigh and ignored the question.
I must say that with very few exceptions I think everyone in my grade is very intelligent and capable
How often do you soap your naval?
I disagree. I think people in my grade aren't really smart but they just study a lot
Navel*
I said my grade 
Not yours
Read my lips
Lol you said my grade acts dumb and they actually aren't, but I think they are and they just study
Oh
Ya I forgot I said that sorry
Opposite of my grade, really
Ummmmm not often. Usually just around it. I don't soap my navel but I use a cotton swab. Wbu? Should I???
Idk I did today because I always just soap around it and so I smelled it because they say each one has unique bacterial flora. And it smelled interesting so I cleaned it
And I took up flossing this week. I like it
What's da plan
How do you find out the smell? Did you just use your finger? I'll try that.
What a strange tradition and specific lifestyle. I wonder what that girl must be thinking, brought up like that. 
Mmmmm well Richie just got back and he's being a bit rebellious 
So maybe 7:30
Isn't flossing addictive!
Ok update me if earlier will work
Yes, lol Hallie selassi (spelling?) I know it bish!
Yes I used my finger
There's an autobiography about a former Kumasi
Kumari
I used my finger and it doesn't smell like anything? Then again, smells don't bother me and I tend to not notice them.
Title??
earlier might work
Ummm more police trouble
So idk...
Again?!?
Again?!?!?!?
Why this time???
:(
Is your mom just calling the police for no good reason 
What did he do
Do you anticipate we will get to go out at all tonight or should I just go get  ice cream for myself lol
We can go
Ill talk in a bit
What time do you need to be home tonight
Doesn't matter 
Ok cool whenever you want to go
Ok I am leaving the house now then
Alright!
I'm all up in here.
Lol kk
Sorry bb
Are you mad
Jacob Gabbitas got his mission call to Bolivia!
Wow
That's actually pretty cool
I KNOW!!!! Makes me kinda wish I was Mormon.
But that's like the worst of the Latin American countries. So poor. 
Interesting I suppose
Also Honduras and Guatemala are not so nice. 
Yes, except.
I would want to explore the world Ya know
Not be bound to that calling and have to keep it all in that context. To go on a mission affords no freedom
Maybe he can pull a Garden of Steven and have a secular awakening and then fuck the mission and spend the rest of his life among the villagers 
That's the premise of this film I saw
A what?
Oh
It's actually really cute. If you have free time there's this award winning short films website 
I'll send the link
I mean that's the israeli section but there's a Guatemalan one and that's where garden of Steven is
Thanks
Arianne got married
And ya no problem
To whom
Seriously though you need to check out that website. There's also this film called La Cruz you should watch. It's on YouTube though.
It smells very nice outside.
Some military guy
Can you find my celebrity doppelgänger 
Yes but it is not the normal rain smell
Are you not going to skool 2day
Benjamin Bratt maybe
Hey
I went to school late today but it was such a waste of time
Literally sat around and did some math problems all day
What'd you do today?
Also lol I don't think he looks like me at all. I feel like you chose some random xican Jagath
*hahah
Not Jagath
Where do you usually shop for shoes
You and him have similar features
Today I watched glee.
And got a haircut
I don't shop for shoes 
I have specific shoes in mind that have the same price everywhere so it doesn't matter
For dress shoes I happened to buy mine at h&m because I was there buying a tie. But that was coincidental 
Hey bae
Is your haircut anything different
I hate talking about these tests but they're so fucking stupid oh my god
I've been doing math prep all afternoon
And I also went shoe shopping
My mom didn't know that visiting colleges is a thing so she wants me to go to the northeast this summer
Like for the last week of July
No it's a lot shorter but it will return in a few short weeks
I tried to follow the solution for a BC FRQ and it was a challenge. I feel bad.
One of the brown kids posted it
LOL. 
Tbh it's probably not a good use of your time or money at this point... Much better to have a clearer idea of which schools plus have students there plus be on a program
If I were you I would look into the fly-in applications ASAP
Many are due during the summer
I hate those haircuts! On myself. I feel like they're just a waste of money. I'm seriously considering shaving the sides like you suggested.
Lol I can probably solve it hahhhh
Basically I'm going to use it as an excuse to travel by myself hahah
I might sneak into some classes
Pretend I'm a student
Befriend some students and get into the parties
But they don't have classes in July
Or parties
Or anything
Except at Dartmouth because they are weird
But literally nothing goes on
THAT IS LITERALLY THE POLSTRA SELFIE HOLY SHIT
You forgot the shirtless part (;
Idk why lissa and Martha are visiting Massachusetts then lol I guess they won't be doing anything 
They can do tours I suppose.
I really think it is a waste to go all the way out there during the summer to do that. If it were closer, sure. Need to go during the school year. That is the beauty of the basis senior year. You have so much time to do that kind of thing
But also, people don't tend to be so friendly to people just touring and not affiliated with an event, from my experience. It's really too bad. Maybe it's different at schools where people have more time to frolic about. 
Never drink tea after eating mustard...
So you suggest the fly in and staying overnight in the dorms then rather than touring?
Do you get a tour with the fly in?
Mm sometimes? The tour is really really inconsequential
Like you just walk around and say what the buildings are and they say a bit of history. The walking around you would get anyway and the history maybe not but its really never a lot. But on most fly-ins you would have an option to take a tour
Well yes I recommend that but it is not an option for a whole lot of schools before applying. 
I would say go to as many of those for schools you are at all considering
But the schools with less money aren't going to do them as much
Ok and also I don't know if I said this earlier but
Has your mom said anything regarding financial aid?
What are her plans?
Assuming she gets better in the near future and goes back to work, you are going to be pretty fucked
I've walked in on some UA tours and it was the most boring and unimpressive thing I had ever walked into. But I've heard that just visiting kinda boosts your chance for acceptance.
Lol Pima fly in
Well she just had surgery and she's going into physical therapy this month
So this year for income is going to be pretty dry
She hasn't worked since Jan 3rd I think? And she won't be going to for a while. 
When do you start financial aid stuff?
It's actually just gauging interest. That can be done many ways. eting with the rep at the school visit. Just going to the school visit. Signing up when they hand out the lists at the visits. 
going to visit the college will not make a large impact and probably no impact given you meet them at school. Also it is very few schools that gauges the visits, I believe. 
Ok so you will probably get a nice package for your first year of college at least. 
Also let me just say, everyone more or less gets into the schools they ought to get into. There aren't surprises for the most part, other than the schools with such low rates that it's a crapshoot for all. Visiting or not visiting is a part of a broader mythology of minor things one should do to get ahead. I think all of it is BS. Either you have what they are looking for in the meat of your application (GPA, scores, essay, recommendations, course load) , or not. 
Hey sorry b I need to finish studying and then go to bed really soon. It's not like I have tests tomorrow LOL.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Goodnight!
Alright good luck on math!!!!
In ex machine he cut himself to prove to himself he was human
Machina
Hey
How was your day today?
Why did you originally think he cut himself
I had no idea at all
It was ok. I really didn't do anything. I am so glad you guys are out soon because I am beginning to be so bored
Wbu
How was it
It was soooo fucking stupid. Today the college board sent representatives to basis to watch our AP ceremony. the school went all out and got post AP pizza, a balloon entrance arch, and the tunnel went throughout the entire school so 5th graders were also part of it
Hahahahahahahs LOL
LOLOLOLOLOL
I kinda knew that was the reason. I just thought he was so caught up in this machine world that he wanted to make sure he was still human
So I guess I'm right :)
Math was pretty okay. The only difficult part was the last 2 FRQs no calculator.
And then I was supposed to take seminar today but they ordered me the late test and my chinese cancellation fucked everything up. 
Zayna and jen and I left early and we went to Zayna's to watch pulp fiction
but let me tell you something
Zayna was like, "yeah you can come but my dad kinda doesn't like you right now." I had never had an extended conversation with her dad and I didn't know why feelings like this would come about, right?
She said it was because I'm with you. I started crying and I got super upset and I told her that is really unfair and rude.
And I told her I'm just not going to go back on Friday
Ok but this isn't leaving us
AHDOFPEOETJRNFNXOODWK FJEOWKSOCRLEB :(
That's great! Here's hoping for that 5.
So when are you taking seminar?
:(. I'm sure he would feel a bit differently if Zayna didn't embellish the story. 
Why the capitals?
Are you and her ok still after that?
I'm pretty confident! For sure a 4 or 5.
Seminar is happening during the late testing session, which happens in two weeks. That might not seem like a big deal but I was kinda worried about taking it today. I need to review the rubrics over that time and do some practice essays with Rosinbum.
Her default story is always the "I love Palestinians" one. And capitals because I am fucking pissed off! I told her that who I am with should be none of his business and that I didn't feel comfortable being there since he feels that way.
She actually felt bad about the whole thing and told me to just stay but neglected the other stuff
Idk. I need to talk to her when I'm calm.
Lol imagine if we met again in 20 years and I'm some manager at the college board 
Brian Simpson puts African on all the standardized test forms and as his race since he was born in South Africa, even though he is super white.
I really like it when you send me articles and videos throughout the day haha, it's so sweet.
Sorry b I'm in my bass lesson. Will respond after
I figured haha don't worry
Tbh it'll just help him get into the U of a instead of being stuck at pima so I don't judge that hard. Sarah Wooders is another story
Pacific Islander my ass, that bitch is asian
Did you see this college board guy
What's up
Are you studying
What is tomorrow
Yeah, I saw the guy but he just looked like a young pretentious rich white guy with gay subtleties.
What is Sarah? I thought she was Vietnamese.
Tomorrow is the chinese final. Thursday is physics. Friday APUSH. I'm just reviewing my chinese stuff
I don't get how Reza failed because she literally told us what is on the final
I've also been checking my eBay watch list. Sperrys and oxfords end in a day!
Lol
Look up this movie Maggie. It's a zombie film with Abigail Breslin and Arnold Schwarzenegger and it actually looks intriguing.
Omg we can be that gay couple that matches
She is Japanese
Alright I'll look it up
Maybe she does that now because he failed lol
Well tbh he just doesn't know chinese so even if he knew what was on it it doesn't matter
Wow bitch we somewhat match occasionally. Probably will more often w my new Aimee inspired clothing purchases. 
Mmm I don't think so. She's always very generous
Ok idk if you'll like the movie though because it's one of those emotional horror films
Yeah probably not, I really don't like Arnold
Any other exciting movies coming out?
I love going to see movies with you
It's like the highlight of my week
1906 painting by ottoman artist Osman Bey. I really love it
And here's a shitty photo of the cardinal that was in my yard today.
Islamic art and architecture is my favorite! There is this illustrated epic, Hamzanama, with over 1,400 detailed illustrations. It is so beautiful, you HAVE to look it up. It's the ancient Persian equivalent of the Illiad and the Odyssey according to the NYTimes lol. But like I used to go to the art section of bookstores and always look at pictures of Islamic art.
I love seeing movies with you too! It's such a nice tradition <3
Sometimes I look at my watch list and count how many movies we have seen together and I count how many movies I've seen between moves we have seen together
I saw this very beautiful red chested bird a few days ago but it was too fast and flew away :(
I'm seeing Roar tomorrow haha I'll tell you how it is
This week there's Clouds of Sils Maria and Lady from Shanghai
Both films I want to see
Lol why roar? It looked SOOO bad? Is that why you are seeing it lol
Are we going to be able to hang out this weekend
I'll check the Muslim Iliad out 
Birds are so fickle
Hahah roar because I was asked to see it. Maybe it will be a good movie to laugh at
Yes we can, on Saturday? I kinda need to because I have to buy a Mother's Day gift
So are energetic dogs, damn it!
I notice how you are using passive verbs to avoid saying who you are going with bitch
Can't fool me
#ivy
Hahaha I'm going with Bella
Ya huh
Alright. Saturday
I subconsciously use passive when I don't want to draw attention to those details, it's not intentional though lol
Maggie @ 9:30 PM screen 2 so we can get the couch
You don't have to see it only because I want to! I want us both to enjoy the movie and I know you don't do zombies.
There's a new song with Britney and Iggy lol. Pretty Girls.
Ooh!
Ok well if any other movies come to mind. I think I can handle Maggie
Alright cool. Goodnight :)
Goodnight
No thx brown bear
Isn't that so cute!!!
How was your day?
What is it?
The snap?
My day is alright. I'm gonna go volunteer with Reza at saaf later
No, the bear is cute
What do you do there? Like what does volunteering consist of
Eh it depends. It could be just about anything
Did you know the brown bear is the brown mascot? Was that intentional
How was your day
Oh ok
Yeah! It was intentional actually 🐻
Jk no it wasn't
Roar was such a bad movie. It seems like it should have been a mistake and I'm so surprised that it wasn't.
Both the acting and story were super shitty and we laughed during the entire movie
Chinese final went well. and omg APUSH review was the most helpful thing ever
Now I've just gotta do a bunch of physics tonight
How is/was volunteering
What was the story?
That's fantastic? When is your last exam again?
It was fine
There were two socially awkward asian guys
And a gay ass heroin addict
They were from cat foot, the Asians
Well there's a family and the mom and dad got into some argument, so the dad flies to Africa to do some research and studies the animals. I guess the family decides to come visit him and he's out an about so the family settles into his house. Basically the entire movie is about how the family is unaccustomed to the animals and freaks out, until the dad gets there and he says they're not really harmful, just playful
But the mom bitch does a lot of screaming and there's a lot of falling into the water
Yes! Very fantastic. Last exam is seminar during projects lol.
Maybe I'll volunteer at this place sometime lol
My mom and I just got into this argument because she wants me to babysit on Saturday while her and Richie go out
And I told her that's such a waste of time because he hates us and that I don't like him. then she was like "brothers are brothers" and I totally disagreed and said its just a label
What's up sugar bun
That's like saying "children shouldn't be stopped"
That's so dumb
I just got home
So I am laying in the dark
That's a boring plot
Ok when's the last non-seminar so
AP
Are you gonna babysit, then?
It's so fucking stupid. I told her forgiveness only works in the real world once the person is not currently doing whatever it is that bothers you.
It was boring but it was entertaining
Also weird knowing that so many people were injured and they required stitches and plastic surgery
5/13/15 language, why'd
*why?
Party day hahaha?
I'm not sure :(
People were injured on the set???
Oh I just figured we could go out to celebrate
Ok just let me know if/when you have free time over the weekend
Lol. Shit's intense.
Yeah we should totally go see a groovy movie and eat somewhere nice
You know I haven't had hot wings in years! And I think we should try some
1977????
Sure. I hear Rocco's is good
For wings
OH FUCK
I HAVE A GREAT IDEA
"The production filming schedule for this movie was originally project estimated to require six months. In total, it took seven years to film the movie, four of these were spent completing the principle photography. Shooting was delayed at various times for varying reasons such, the flooding of the ranch being the main one. The on-set disasters literally added years to the shooting schedule."
9PM screening room animal house Sunday 
It was released in 1981
OHHHH
I thought it was new
That pizza place? Oh ok, we can also do Buffalo Wild Wings sometime.
Mmmmmmm that's Mother's Day and western moms take that shit seriously
I'll see tho and get back to you
I might have to go to some dinner 
10pm Saturday 
Is also a show time
Have you seen that movie before?
Yes
Alright well anyway I'm going to sleep. So hope it goes ok with your family for the remainder of the evening. Goodnight!
goodnight💝💝💝
Hi! How are you? How was your day today?
That article isn't up anymore but I saw it this morning before I went to school lol. It was like, "According to Reuters, Franco still enjoys McDonalds" hahah. Also, I'm halfway through the latest This American Life
I just took my physics exam, and by just took I mean literally. We started late around 1:30 because AP Spanish ended late. Then kids were like, "oh on the exam book cover it says  we can refuse to take the test if it's administered at some time other than 12-1pm" and so the proctor had to call the office and it was this huge deal
But the exam went pretty well. MC was difficult but it was good.
Thank you for your AP prep books haha :)
This last one had some shining moments
The Korean story was great
My day was ok. Fine except meeting with ATC was unproductive
What ended up happening
The physics curve is nice so hopefully it's ok
As I said I skipped 2-3 FRQs and got a 5
Yeah the Korean story was my favorite. The stalking one was just plain bizarre, like I couldn't even relate and I thought she took it too far.
Well we had to take the AP haha. Ate too much pizza afterward :( 
This is a different test though. They changed it this year
We only had 4 FRQs!
It was really sad because Demi didn't even sign up for the AP but had to take it
And she didn't even study or anything
I know I thought it was such a waste of money, and so strange
Is pizza standard this year?
Why did she have to take it
Has she still not passed one?
I was surprised I hadn't heard the Korean story, because it involves a top celebrity of theirs
Hey so APUSH ends around noon tomorrow. Maybe do something after or later?
Yeah and like she flew out to different places and dedicated precious time to pointless endeavors
To be fair we waste a ton of time on dumb shit perpetually
She is entitled to that
Maybe haha. But I got all the teachers nice Lindt's chocolates to make it up to them and it's just what I do
Sorry my phone almost died, just got home to charge
Yeah let's hang
What do you want to do
Idk why she had to take it but that's not any of my concerns right now. Right now what I'm worried about is this exam haha. I've got to cover 1850-present in 3.5-4 hours
Or... Go to sleep :)
Jk
We can see a movie and get chicken wings or go somewhere nice since I'll basically be done with APs
Lol there's a difference between our dumb shit and dedicating money and weekends to stalking your father and photographing him 
We could see get hard
Eh hate we lets talk tomorrow
I'll come by at like 1:00
Study well!
Okay, thanks :) goodnight!
There's this post AP lunch thing I got invited to
Is that okay? Or do you want to come?
Or maybe we can do something after that
Which is the best thing to do
I'm like already here doing an SRP thing, when does the lunch go until
Ok just come with us
Are you leaving now?
I'm still in SRP
Mmm we're leaving for BJs around 12:45/1 I'll let you know
Ok I'll be done
By then
Ok cool
What sperry shoe size R u again
9. I have a pair of 8.5 that is a bit small and a 9.5 that is large
So the 9 is what I tried on today
?
No
That was 9.5
Ok thanks bb
Had fun w you tonight
Goodnight!
Goodnight!
I find action movies so hard to follow and I am really lost with Drive. Like the blood and gore is actually pretty awesome but mobster movies with covert operations and plans are confusing.
Also I had this weird dream that I texted you about some party I was throwing. So like for the party I had to go to party city but I got trapped in there with some xicans and kim and Kanye and they decided to do an impromptu photo shoot with party city supplies. Then I had to drive to phoenix for some interview and I ended up renting a penthouse hotel for the day (even though I was staying for like 2 hours) and I sent you all these really pretty sunset pics and selfies lol. After that I drove back to tucson and had to babysit this prodigy ninja baby girl who could do a 1 foot jump over the monkey bars. And like the baby's dad just threw her on the floor and let her crawl and catch herself. Anyway, once I finally made it to the party you couldn't go :(
There's this film I really want to see. I heard an interview with Carey Mulligan on NPR and it's about this girl in Victorian England who attracts three different suitors but it's so gorgeous and looks good. It's called Far From the Madding Crowd
What are you doing today?
Imagine masturbation pre-Internet
I feel the same way usually but drive was great for me
That's such a crazy dream
When is it coming out?
Today I am at the family friend's for a bit and then I'm free wbu
#playboydreams
I mean I like drive too but the plot is hard for me to follow. I also never understood the Ryan Gosling craze until now hahah
It was such a cool dream though because I felt like a cowboy.
The Graduate is playing at the fox theatre on May 14
Fuck! It's only at Harkins
Today I'm going to church and then babysitting from 6-8 and then not doing anything.
Do you actually think Get Hard looks good?
He is so cool in drive. I felt the same way
Wait which is at harkins
Lol but that's 8PM
No not really, but given how much everything else sucks
Oh ya u might want to delete Instagram
I already did 
I love that bad boy driver look and he pulls It off really well. Last year I used to wear baggy jeans and a long sleeve denim shirt and timbs because I thought I looked like kanye and like a badass but then Priscilla made me realize how bad it was 
Far from the madding crowd at harking
What do you mean at 8PM
I love the Korean gangster look though, where they think OBEY and Nike are cool
Lol you should dress up like that and send a selfie
I don't like asian gangster lol
I like Chris though
Babysitting until 8 prevent any later things
Hahaha
How often do you shave the full beard
I shaved today
Yeah I like Chris too. Like if I had loads of money I would dress like him
What does she mean
I don't think it prevents later things lol
I have come home at 12:30 on school nights
I'm starting to shave the full beard each time I shave so this marks the second time. I'm going to do it every Saturday. 
Wbu?
Oh she says because she's never seen me shave before lol
That's the black kid
Also on the top next to Emma
Oh he doesn't look white
I mean black
And he looks 12
I shave like every 2-3 days, sometime I skip the mustache
Ok what would you want to do
What does he look like?
Hey hey hey
I'm sending you this sentence I made up so I can remember some things to tell you: I had a dream we were on a road trip to a church to stab it
I remember reading diary of a wimpy kid and Greg was going into middle school and he was like "there are always gorillas in 8th grade who shave 3 times a day"
but like our school only had the Soras
Maybe we can do coffee with Reyna?
He looks half-Hispanic 
Lol our gorillas don't shave
Yeah that sounds awesome
Lol alright so here's the plan
8:30 we're doing a triple date thing downtown
Nate called
So we might do food for ascension or tea and then walk around
Reyna and James are coming too
Aight
Is that ok with your
Religion
Yes
Should I pick you up
I meant is it ok with u to do that but I autocorrected to your and I rolled with it
Mmm I can get a ride if you can't take me
Yep I gotcha
From your house?
I don't want you to waste a bunch of gas though
But yes my house
Eh I do that anyway
Ok so
Should I come at like 810 to be sure your mom is home?
Lol I could also let you know if she's home
Well yeah but it takes me 15 min to get there
She's at golf n stuff right now
:(
?
I am confused 
Well idk when she's coming home I can ask
Like she was only supposed to go out for dinner
But my brother is a manipulative little fuck
Fuck him for having fun on his birthday at your minor expense
Jk I get it
??? It's not his birthday lol
His birthday is in November
Or is it? Dun dun sun
Dun
Ok I have 2 stories to tell you in the car, remind me and I will remind you of the ones you earlier mentioned
Maybe we can go at 9
1. Reza's birthday
2. Santana
I'm expecting to be out pretty late tonight
Where is GPA?
GPA getting high
On jesus?
Cuz you know, I'm pretty sure my AP scores will be good
Grandpa
Lol jk
He's at the store but I promised to babysit
When is Reza's birthday?
That's the question. 
Oh it's the same week as yours actually
So around the end of Jan
My mom thinks she will be home in two hours :(
What the fuck
What the fuck
Like last week he was flipping her off and ran away
Apparently that means nothing to her
That's like too late. That would mean dinner at 945-10
He's literally just using her
Ok he's a kid
I was the same way
You need to cut him some slack, kids use their parents continually. That's like the point of childhood
You can't apply our interpretations and morals like that
I was a shit as a kid constantly and if my parents punished me all the time I would have just hated them more and had no chance of a relationship ever. Your mom is being reasonable
She is trying to mend things and give him good memories with her in hopes of a long term success
When I was a child I constantly saw through the material things my parents would buy me to make up for whatever, and I would call them out on it and would refuse to accept it. And when I was in the wrong I would sit by myself until I was ready to ask for forgiveness, rather than pretend it never happened and accept gifts. 
It just doesn't make sense to me
Well then you should know that most or many kids are not nearly as emotionally mature as you were
And your mom's behavior in this case is normal. And I'm not saying that she's always right with respect to him, and of course not that he's always right
I was just a really quiet kid at home and tried to never get in trouble and then when I went to school I released all of my repressed shitty behavior lol
So I guess that's where I was in the wrong
Lol I was so the opposite
Perfect at school, massive raging asshole at home
Anyway
Is she really gonna come that late?
It might be ok for us but not the other 4....
Yayyyyy
Lol that was the obvious solution all along
Well it's okay for Reyna and I texted Nate/Diviya about it, so I can actually leave early (~9:15) since it "starts" at 10 and downtown is far
She just hates leaving Alex w gpa because he gets upset sometimes
Look at what my mom sent me a few weeks ago;
hott 😻
You look like middle school nightmares
Ok
I'll come around then
You can actually come around 9
Ok
Here
Ok cool like 50 seconds
Hey, how was volunteering? How are you feeling?
It was really fun!
I feel so exhausted though. I took a nap and it made me feel worse. Wbu?
Hey
Sorry b
That's cool. Was the aftermath of the match really sticky and sexy
I just woke up
I had this dream that you and I were older and comparing out AI abilities (because in the future each person gets AI assistance as they age)
Lol no, the jello was fun to touch though
I most just cleaned buckets and tarps and picked up trash
What was our AI like?
What did you do today
Today, Aimee darling, all I could do was think about how beautiful and intimate last night was
Jk lol. I did that and other things.
Once I got home I put my gifts on the table and then my mom started crying and thaaaat whole thing happened
I set up mouse traps haha
We went to the mall and saw the Avengers which was terrible. I couldn't even add it to my watch list.
Then we went out to dinner and I fell asleep and now I'm here. Kinda having trouble staying awake. It was one of thoooose naps
What else did you do today?
Idk basically we had memory assistance and the ability to watch movies in our minds and it was this robot implanted in us that remembered everything we saw 
I only had that dream because the avengers was all about AI
Some action films with very meticulous villains scare me because I think that anybody could watch the movie and be inspired by whatever this villain did and already have the logistics to execute the crime 
Which are always so massive with many casualties in the film
I never really think of superhero villains as criminals
What all did you get your mom again
I had trouble staying awake too. So exhausted still
Was it worse than the first avengers
I watched some glee
Literally all I did. Oh I got burritos after volunteering with Reza because I didn't have breakfast 
I'm not necessarily talking superhero villains but like antagonists in realistic movies. 
I literally just got her flowers, a UA cup, nail polish, chocolate, and lip balm. She says the card was the most beautiful thing though.
It was waaaaay worse
And it completely dragged on
Lol that sounds like a day
Right now we (Madeleine and Diviya) are trying to work out how this hotel business is going down
Also I'm so excited because I only have to go to school on Wednesday this week
A loft membership for a year is $50 
Oh, yes I thought about Nightcrawler a lot
And how we get media, like TMZ, and the ethics of it
I, on the other hand, need to go like every day for a couple minutes to meet w Mr J
Oh that's pretty good
Is your mom proud of her alma mater
Yeah that's probably what made nightcrawler 10x more disturbing for me. Clearly a very extreme case of that, but it made me wonder about news footage in a new way. I don't think they're allowed to show graphic images like that on TV though. 
Even now that school is almost over?
She is, which I don't understand. I don't think it's made her any more intelligent.
Where did your parents graduate from
Well goodnight my love <3 
For SRP, so yes.
Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University for college and grad school. Then Claremont McKenna my mom started PhD, and finished at the U of A, which is actually the number one public school and number three school overall in her field of study
Sorry I was shower
But anyway goodnight!
sometimes it's weird saying goodnight when I think you're asleep and then you're not, so I just don't reply because then I think you're actually going to sleep hahaha
Yes sometimes
You say goodnight and even if I am not asleep I don't respond as to not make it awkward
Well last week the only reason I sent goodnight first was because I had to study haha
Not because I was actually going to sleep 
I was up until 1 am last night because I watched this gay movie, Weekend, and I listened to 15 minutes of the latest this american life
Which had such a lame intro
Study for language?
Was it a good movie
Haven't started this week's podcast yet
I was curious, so I looked into it, and there is an asian hj massage place next to BJ's
No last week to study for apush
Lol it's one of those indie romantic movies. No interesting developments
Are you coming to the school today?
You should take me somewhere because I'm bored out of my fucking mind
I wasn't going to but ok I guess I can
An Asian hj place?! I watched this show where an uncle took his nephew to one so the nephew could tell his friends he got a hj
Like a 6tj grader
Oh well you don't have to if you don't want to
 Nah I probably should see mr. J, I'm just being lazy. 
Actually
He's probably busy by the time I would get there. I'll just come by and we can hike
I think Demi could work at one
Ok cool what time?
Lol so could you
1:15
I'm not asian though
1:20
Kkkkk
Here
Ay
Hey bae I just woke up
Damn, I'm so exhausted
Idk what it is
How are you feeling?
Y tu mama tambien tomorrow?
Jennifer sent me this picture. This is her coworker who she thinks is exactly like me and looks similar to me and is also gay, and she literally always tells us that we are basically like each other 
He is like if you and Anthony and a person with ridiculous cheek bones mixed
He is so strange looking!
So about the movie, I have a bass lesson until 630 so consider that and traffic and picking you up and the fact that it is free.... So I think it could only work if you got there on your own. Is that possible
I figured you were sleeping
How long did you nap for
I think he looks half black and half xican. Also, I think he resembles Zayn Malik. The guy in the picture is too beautiful to be true. I would be too intimidated to even look at him.
That is possible. I can get a ride but I don't think I can do much afterwards, considering how awful I feel when I don't get a lot of sleep. So I think I should get home at a reasonable time so I can sleep at a reasonable hour, I'm sorry!
See I so disagree
I slept from 6-8:40ish
Hahahah.
He is like when someone is so distinctive it is either God level hot or super not and I feel he is the latter
No that's fine. So no movie?
I'm fine with just the movie
Oh yeah. That's how I feel about Gil and Elliot. 
I have a real question for you please don't judge me
But I think I'm going to ask you my life questions because you make me feel comfortable about my intelligence insecurities 
When do you use whom?
What do you mean life questions and what do you mean use?
Yes to movie but I can't do something after.
Like I mean questions that arise throughout my day about word usage and concepts of things that people should know
OMG OK
I thought this was like philosophical
Like when I consider it OK to use people
I thought it was a moral challenge within you
I've decided that while I can kinda blame my mom for a lot of this, I want someone to teach me the right way and call me out
Hahahahahahah
Well you're not dating Jay
:P
Tbh I never really notice who vs whom and I don't think others do either. 
I always thought it was that if it was as a direct object it is whom, but I never really thought that through and now it is very confusing
And so I looked it up and it is like mental gymnastics
So I would say if someone calls you out or judges you, they are a dick. Pretty sure Joseph is the only one who like actually knows the rule. I just usually know which one sounds right in a sentences 
Sorry b
I would die if I was dating jay because he never will discuss things practically. It always boils down to his weird philosophies which are all he is willing to speak about
If I were*
Yeah because I think you've used whom before? and I think it's more convenient to just say who. I used to know the rule in 9th grade but when I don't use it for many years then it's unimportant. But yeah, I'd rather ask you some of these things because they are things I have looked up and been totally perplexed.
Lol YESSSSSSS. Sometimes I just don't talk to him because a lot of his arguments are circular and he changes his opinion at least once during the argument.
Idk he told me that he acts this way because in India he always questioned society and the government, and he found it fun to do so, so he does that here too
Knowing these bullshit philosophies though don't do much for his arguments
And half the time nobody knows what he's saying unless they've taken a class
Which frustrates me
Because then it makes me feel kinda stupid for not knowing this concept, until I realize nobody else knows too haha except him
I often wonder how certain people, like Jay, talk with their partners
I cannot imagine how him and Elizabeth work out
Also this website, with very funny ads haha
Neither can I lol. But I've never talked to Elizabeth extensively so idk if she's kinda the same way.
I thought 25 Jordan rd. was something about shoes on the first read. It's weird when addresses have such low numbers 
Did you know our address system is based on distance from Stone and Congress? Like 1000 W. ans 1 Mile west of stone
I suppose she took 2 years of critical theory 
: mom, why are you only eating bread and butter for dinner?
Mom: it's organic.
You know she bought me kombucha because it is healthy, and after reading the wiki page and stuff, there have been more reported deaths and illnesses than "health benefits"
*"healthy"
That is actually such an interesting fact! How did you know that or how did you find out?
Have you tried it with your address
Like how would it work with my address
So in theory my house is 3.565 miles east of that intersection
Omfg
I learned just now that sahaurita is West of here!! I thought it was south, nearly green valley
Ah Nope, the map was just turned sideways
Ok so I did a not very accurate approximation on maps and got 3.3 miles. So factor how rough an approximation and I think it could be correct
Lol
And besides the lack of health, kombucha is like raspberry vinegar it is so nasty tasting
What is wrong with it in terms of health though?
Logan Graybill explained it to me in freshman year
I think his dad is a city planner or knows one
Lol that is probably the least nutritious meal ever
So then mine is 8.262 miles east. That is such a life hack wow. Like I could just hear an address and basically get a general idea of where it's located.
Oh yeah hahah. I used to live 30 min east from there in Vail. It's like southwest.
Well there is no evidence for any health benefits, that's the thing. There are only cases of CNS impairment and liver toxicity.
And it's like $4 a bottle
I thought that was quote worthy lol when she said that earlier I knew I had to tell you
How would you differentiate between right and left quadrants though, using that system?
Like when does north turn into east, etc?
Ok so the East-West running streets are lettered either east or west, and the same for north-south running roads
And the east-west are usually called street, and the north-south are avenue
500 N. 1st Ave vs 3872 E. 6th St
So like if you heard 3000 E. 6th St. You would theoretically know that it is on 6th street (which could be anywhere north/south) but surely 3 mi east of the intersection. It could be 3000 E. 6th and be 10 miles or 3.001 miles from the actual intersection. 
It's weird to me that I have lived in tucson and never known that, and that I couldn't figure out the avenue/street thing or any of this on my own.
Oh ok so there is no way to tell northeast or southeast from the system
Are a lot of other cities like that?
I think most newer cities are like this. Older ones have small numbers. 
That are just like counting how many residences on each street. So if you built one inbetween it could be 61 1/2z 
.
This really depresses me. Idk I feel like if I had a chronic illness I wouldn't post things like that.
Also did you watch the graduation video finally
Whenever I receive snaps from you it feels like such a gift and I have to wait until the right time to open it
Yes lol I did
Lol it is the kind of gift where it could be like a pair of socks or a new laptop.
You just don't know until you open it
I can't believe we had sex
In an open place today
In broad daylight
I feel sorry for her but her public pity party makes me feel lesser. It's so sad
Lol no, it's a kind of ephemeral cerebral gift. Like mind candy.
I don't know what it will be and the only hint I have is the red or purple box 
Lol all I meant is that it could be awesome or like whatever
Honestly the setting made it very enjoyable for me. I don't get paranoid in public places like that, it's nice. A place that would be kinda thrilling to have sex would be downtown
Or in a library or in a church
Like the Bookman's bathroom
Yeah that would be cool
Is it rude to come for some SRPs and then leave during the break
Also are you required to stay
I do not know the answer to either
I don't even know what time it is at
Lol you're going from 8:30-8:55
I remember when these had just started and I looked at Isamu's Jewish identity thing and i don't think he did a good job of synthesizing the info he got from the interviews
Like he wrote the things he heard but never explained it and idk. It just seemed really inconsistent and it frustrated me
And like basically it's just a bunch of pictures of things he saw while visiting different cities with the occasional mention of an interview where someone talks about what kind of Jew they are
Something I would love to do my SRP on would be extremism in Turkey or Israel or the role of women/muslims/jews/etc. In society but it seems too charged
So Sonoran Science Academy offers Turkish and has a big Turkish population, including faculty and students, and I remember Richie's dad would always condemn them and say awful things about why we have to learn Turkish and why an American can't run the school
So in 6th grade when I went there a lot of students shared this anti-Turkish sentiment, which now is absolutely deplorable
At least for me
Well from what I heard there was a bit of Turkish superiority going on by the Turks there?
Which led to resentment, I heard.
When did you go see his SRP?
Yeah there is. Like there were some exchange students from turkey and they were revered by all the staff, no matter what they did. 
Also it was strange to take Turkish of all languages
I wish I had paid more attention in the class though
I didn't go see his SRP, it's on the same day as yours lol.
But I've been following his blog and it pisses me off.
Veris, Diego, and Chaiyo took their APs high.
All of the APs? 
Well high is their resting state by now..
Oh speaking of which
Also I have been on 🌿for the last 2 hours
But it has been mild. Idk why
"This group of students scored roughly 3% lower on school exams taken at age 16" it's funny how relevant that was lol
And sure maybe it doesn't affect IQ
But during the test you're not able to think clearly and focus
No sure it was just related because
It was on my mind
I worry a lot about it causing iq loss
Really? Hahah
So before hitting it today I looked it up and found that article as the second result
Do you think it influences some conversation topics
Or like things that you say
Because when you're high I can't even tell
You talk about the same things in the same way
Whereas with me I talk about weird things I usually don't
That congratulatory email you received from V's mom made me really sad
Sometimes yes, today, not really
I overthink things and write them over and over to get them right now
Yes :(
How do you think your mood changes? Are you more sensitive (like how you were on Saturday when I touched you) or contemplative? And what do you think about
What are you thinking about right now
Haha I remember my first really good high and it took me minutes to write a coherent text
A lot of these SRPs are so fucking technical, damn
I don't think about much, at least not tonight
But yes I am sensitive to touch
Pretty horny
Things seem a bit unreal
Enjoy enjoying food
Not so good at watching movies
Easily entertained 
Any specific SRP in mind?
I know you didn't experience the hallucinations and stuff like that but I fear if I try it then the extreme anxiety and depression will overcome me
And that I'll have a bad trip
Sometimes you should just set your phone aside and think in bed
It's a really good exercise
Yes like Shawn and Steven. Also all of those medical SRPs
Why don't you ever get any female condoms from SAAF
I wonder how often safe sex advocates actually have sex 
Like Hannah and Xóchitl and Sarah
Or like people who work at planned parenthood
For the two besides Hannah, apparently more than the average basis girl by far
I only went there once lol, I'll do it suppose. Didn't know you were so motivated 
If that's your mindset you probably should never do it because a mindset like that forecasts disaster
LOL Emily Davis put "currently salvating" instead of salivating with a snap of In-n-out. She ain't jesus
The average basis girl lol. It seems like a very small percentage for the girls in my grade. Your grade has all the horny people.
Yes! after reading Hannah's SRP blog I think you should totally take advantage of your resources
Well I think when I'm actually confronted with the shrooms itself then I won't be like that
Lol using the thousand island dressing to heal some wounds
Maybe she's salving her soul with delicious burgers 
Does not compute. I have been looking for a video of a black person with an asian accent and I finally found it
What percent of your grade has lost it? Do you know?
I may go to sleep any moment now
Preemptive goodnight
Wowww. "She doesn't even look Japanese"
That's really cool though. You always think of interesting things to search hahahaha.
Approximately 22%
a lot of people in my grade have had sex with each other
What if you include the "almost sex" bj people
I would imagine nearly 50%, no??
Almost sex only includes three more :/
So that's 25%
Maybe 30
With your grade I could count at least 24
Anyway goodnight b
🐝🐝🐝
Buzz buzz
AP Lit?
That was damn good
Well made
Would have been better if I knew the plot of Macbeth
I was so proud of that film lol. We had the best and funniest in the class. Shawn and I did all of the filming on my iPad.
Yeah AP lit.
Tbh I don't even know the plot of Macbeth
Why did I ever think that hair was okay
It made me look like a chipmunk 
Yes it looks sooooo bad
Lol for Shawn it wasn't fiction, it was a reenactment 
God, I had the worst breakfast ever
So I had one of those evol egg white with kale, roasted tomato, and goat cheese breakfast sandwiches but the bread got all soggy and it kept dripping everywhere 
Soggy bread = the worst
And then I'm drinking this smoothie that's basically 90% kale and then 10% cherries and blueberries and stuff, but the kale tastes awful. Especially with soy milk.
I want to barf
Lol I thought that too when I was watching it today
Do you keep up with business/economics news?
Look up this restaurant Wilko
We should go there for brunch
"Pulverized Kale"
You said it would be good tasting lol
Was it like frozen and you heated it?
I sometimes follow that news
I know Wilko lol
Isn't it HELLA $$$ tho?
Lol well all my smoothies had a bit of kale. Never as much as I put in today.
Yes it was but that's what the instructions said
Actually you're right. Also there's a lot of bacon and sausage.
Where were you thinking of going?
Well I was thinking about one of the breakfast chains but blue willow could also be cool
He looks so Russian
 I never trusted those certifications, like organic, so I never choose them over the normal option
Blue Willow sounds awesome.
Idk if you also thought this, but I thought the host of This American Life was gay
But then yesterday when billings was talking about him she said he wasn't
My mom refuses to buy any coffee or tea without a Fair Trade label
And she also boycotts Starbucks
I need your help with making a film
It's due the 15th
He isn't... He sounds gay though
Yeah he's married to a woman
Basically I'm going to film a bunch of trophies and AP prep books and my schedule and stuff. Then I realize I'm not happy with that life and I decide to go outside and do some yoga and go running. Then I'm going to post a video of walking down the Grand Canyon. In the background I'm going to to have some yoga music and I'm going to have a voiceover about how sometimes we need to get out and stop worrying about expectations and live for ourselves 
They are the straight couple that kinda look like lesbians though
This was the assignment: "We want you to tell your Grand Canyon story in a creative format such as a video, photo collage, poem, story, interpretive dance, sketch or any other method that you choose"
And if I win I get $100
So I was watching my Macmeth video today for inspiration
Lol
Hahahah ok! I would love to
That sounds fun as hell
Oh you're right. They do look like a lesbian couple hahaha. His voice makes him sound sooo gay. He's really cute.
What is your problem with NPR?
I remember you said you didn't like it
Okay cool. If you want to come over later that'd be great
I'll give you some of the prize money for helping. Or maybe we can go somewhere cool.
That's a very flattering and old photo of him. Here is a better one
Actually I take that back
Total silver fox
Here's an old photo of him: 
I don't like the tilt of their political shows
Eh I don't care for the $
Well I have a bass lesson at 6
So
I mean like I could to yours
He looks so much better now than he did then lol.
Because they're liberal??
I think that NPR does a great job of giving people opportunities to share their opinions and stories
Yeah I meant to my house
Just the political shows not the others
But like we would go to a park or something
I don't think it's even the liberal slant. More that they make it a goal to feed liberal guilt in anyway possible
Make every situation into a cause celebré
Well you could say the same about This American Life too, with the exploitation and conditions segments... I think it's necessary when trying to get people informed about life outside of their little bubble.
No, not if it is a public entity. That is unacceptable
To me
You need to objective and as factually accurate as possible if you are operating publically
You know
At UHS they take their APs at Santa Rita??
Well it's almost impossible to remain objective if they're going to give people the airtime to talk about things, even if there are opposing views.
Lol this year we had a few students taking their APs at basis
Probably homeschooled though
I'm so grateful that get to take our APs for free
*we get
But there aren't opposing views for the most part, and if there are, one is almost always presented in a negative light and receivers far less airtime
Can you see this: 👩‍❤️💋‍👩💏🙏🏾☝🏽👌🏽💪🏽👐🏿👐🏾👊🏾👂👂🏽🙌🏻👸🏾
What does it mean
What do you see
👩‍❤️💋‍👩💏🙏🏾☝🏽👌🏽💪🏽👐🏿👐🏾👊🏾👂👂🏽🙌🏻👸🏾
Should I come over around 3 or so
But don't you think that for the most part the view that gets the most airtime and is portrayed in a positive light is generally morally and socially acceptable, for a good reason?
Well do you see different colored emojis
But they are making that decision for you. This is a repetition more or less of yesterday's discussion but you switched sides?
Different colored?
I got the update
Oh no they all look white to me
Well I'm not saying we should be subjective but I can understand why NPR does what it does
Why Diviya was confused 
Apple is so stupid. Why make an update when only the updated devices can see it.
3 sounds good
Can you see the Israeli flag: 🇮🇱
No
It appears like this
Lol what is this? I just watched it right now
Lol so it is just a guy who is so black that you can't see the features of his face in that lighting
I think he is Ethiopian-Israeli
Hey when is this video due
Today is just not convenient for me :/, would be a lot better to just meet you at the movie after bass
Holy fuck, just read about this cystic fibrosis drug that costs $300K/year
Do you remember what Diviya said about the Unidas girl that died of cancer?
Lol yes I gathered that much from watching it but I thought there was some significance or he was some famous person.
That's okay. The video is due the 15th. I'm planning on filming a bit in Phoenix.
:( that's terrible. Link?
Kinda, why?
Wasn't her name Kelsey? And I think Diviya said she was kinda bitchy
Omg you need to listen to the last segment of the latest This American Life, even though it was pretty bad.
The attitude is just ridiculous
Yeah that's what I thought she said. Just wanted to make sure
Oh shit that is so soon
Eh the article wasn't about that, it just mentioned the price. 
Yeah I'll chug through it today
I started it and don't like it so far
I just don't like superheroes 
I know... I'm going to have to plan out exactly what I need if I want to get it done and edited in time. Also I have to write the voiceover script today.
I came to that conclusion too after finishing it. Then when it go to the comic book part I was bored out of my mind and now I'm listening to stuff you missed in history class.
Lol wow
How I feel about most things
This show was ahead of its time
Lol "powerpuff girls predicted tumblr"
Fuckin toews
That's kind of gay for a douchey frat boy
 
Alex sent this with the caption: I am the face of failure
That is my 10th grade math class
Actually no maybe it wasn't
Poor journalism AZ daily star
I am ok with rats
Omg I found 6 roaches in my bathroom last night but I couldn't call my dad to help kill because it smelled of 🌿so I cried internally
Why is that poor journalism haha? The article was informative and precise. They even addressed how Basis officials were determined to find discrepancies in the data lol.
Hahah you're okay with rats but not roaches
Oh I just saw the tweet
Why didn't you take care of the roaches, hmmmm
🌿 is so beautiful. Like instead of using the word we send a very aesthetically pleasing emoji.
So what is the final plan tonight
Reyna is picking me up at 6
So basically nobody is here lol.
I am here
Where u at
Inside
You need to open the snap
Seriousl 
Seriously
Ok
Sorry my phone was dead
You look abuses
Abused
Did you know I save our movie tickets
I think the loft tickets are so cute
Quite literally. I've never had bruises from sex that hurt until now.
It burns to the touch
There is something I have thought about for the longest time and it might be a bit weird. Like all the time I feel comfortable and inseparable and connected and I want to tell you I love you because I feel like it's right, but it is unnerving. 
1) I would not want you to think I am only saying it to say it, then you think I am not serious, because I would be. 
2) It seems preferable to say it and hear it back, but I feel incapable of acquiring your love. Also, you are weird about public declarations and discussing feelings. 
3) I am not really sure what constitutes love and it could feel different for both of us, but I know how I feel for you. 
Anyway idk, goodnight
Sorry I spaced out
That is really cute
The tickets
And I'm sorry it burns
That's how I feel, that I'm not sure what constitutes love. Sorry I left you hanging at the most inopportune moment
But I do feel very connected to you
And I don't know what I would do without you
Goodnight
It's so stupid because I'm crying and I don't know why
Like I just can't even explain anything
And this isn't a self pity thing but idk
It's so inopportune because I should be asleep lol
Anyway I'm sorry and goodnight.
Oh my god today was like a movie
Last night I was up until 1 am and I couldn't fall asleep and I felt shitty. My body was aching everywhere
Then I had this dream I was late for my language AP
AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED
I was actually late for the exam
What happened?!?
And Wohlford and Toews and Amanda were all at the entrance telling me to run inside and Wohlford and I had to run and she was like "you were supposed to be here at 7:30 I'm so upset with you, stop laughing this isn't funny"
And she was like "The exam already started you are holding up the entire room!!!"
And when I got in the test literally hadn't even started
I never understand running short distances. It saved like maybe one minute. Pretty pointless
Why did you laugh tho
You nervously laugh hardcore, b
I am at skool
So am I and I'm done w APs sooo 
Literally I missed a few bubbles on the answer sheet and they hadn't started yet
I really think it was the nervous laugh and I thought she was half joking
Congrats! No more
Hello
what score do you predict for Lang
Well I actually still have to take seminar :/
Probably a 4 actually. The essays were great because I am the best at them, but I couldn't finish the multiple choice!!!!
Also it took me so long to read the passages
What have you gotten on past APs?
I always forget seminar
Lol I don't think my previous AP scores foreshadow the scores this year
So I'm going to avoid answering that question hahah
It was just an unrelated question
But ok
How was your day today
What do you think about the NSA listening in on personal calls
Also after doing some research I'm more for independent Bernie Sanders
Connolly and I drew this together 
 
Isn't it so psychedelic 
That is super awesome looking. The middle one's feathers look like fingers
Not a fan of NSA doing anything
Why him?
Hey
Idk I like his progressive and social measures even if I don't agree w gun control and immigration stances completely
What's up
Hi sorry
My phone was dead
Oh actually jk lol you just texted me a couple minutes ago
I  am glee-ing as always wbu
My youngest cousin says happy birthday to my dad
My phone also just died rn but I was asleep. I had a dream your grade was doing a senior prank and you didn't want to do it, but the school siphoned gas from your car so you could t leave and you were super pissed. 
What time are you coming tomorrow?
CPS is coming in the morning...
Bc my mom is so inconsiderate and decided to have them come when I literally told her I couldn't
Also that is super cute! I love that age but without the mess and crying lol
Omg Rebecca posted this picture that said "14 APs done, never again" and I was like, holy shit, 14 APs in junior year!!!
Then I realized she meant cumulative lol
Did your family do something today for your dad's birthday?
I think I'll come around 9?
930 maybe
Why did she call them this time
we made him breakfast in bed
Am I rich yet?
Fuck that's when the lady is coming... Can we make it 10:30?
As long as we leave for Phoenix before noon I think
Or around noon
I don't know why she calls them if not to start problems
That's really cute!
I mean yeah but if you think about it I need to pick up you and Nate and Diviya and go to the other side of town, eat at a sit down restaurant and drive back across town... We could do it but it would be rushed. Why do you need to be at home? 
Bitch you were rich the entire time
I already told my mom I couldn't meet with the lady and she was like "eh, your friends can wait"
"This is important"
I think the sperry look w rolled up pant legs is sexy
Super sexy
You know, CPS is often not on time, too...
Well either way I'm heading to that side to pick up nate so I'll come by around 10:30 and if you are done, great, and if not... Idk. 
Okay Madeleine said we can leave for Phoenix around 1
Ok
If not I'll leave anyway, lol
I mean still though what if COS is late
Oh ok
So I'll come by when I come by and you'll just come
Ok but if your mom says no I'm sure you won't argue
Mmm okay so here is my plan. If the meeting isn't over by 10:30 then I just won't go to brunch or I'll meet you guys there or wherever you are going afterwards. I will let you know before you get Nate.
Literally a CPS meeting is the most inconvenient thing
You know they came to the school last year and pulled me out of euro
That's probably why I got a 3, hmph 
Ok, I would love for you to come to the brunch and I hope you do 
^there's 1/4 of an answer to your ap question haha
What are CPS meetings like
Lol I was just thinking that
I really want to go because we have been talking about going there for the longest time, damn it. I mean even if I come late I can get yogurt and granola or something light since I might eat before.
Well their main focus is abuse and abuse-oriented discussion. They ask about methods of punishment I have had throughout my life and about a lot of safety stuff. Then they ask questions about my social life. And then, the weird thing is that I never hear from them again.
Did you parents ever spank you or like what did they do?
I remember bleeding from my lip because I got slapped in the face :(
do you think that experience stuff like that as a child impacts me later in life?
Like I mean sure there's the memory but what do you think
I think it makes me more sensitive to seeing other children and it makes me repulsed to the idea of parenthood because I wouldn't want a child experiencing the same thing 
Also I think it makes me more caring for Alex
Interesting really, but I didn't pay attention in euro class all year. By the time my academic change kicked in I only had about a week to study and essays are always my strongest, so I think that's what saved me because I didn't know a lot of specifics and could bs the essays but not MC.
They spanked me and then they regretted it because I spanked them back
So after like age 4 they didn't spank
And no not really as long as it isn't extreme
Honestly I don't think there is anything wrong with spanking as long as it is accompanied with strong parenting otherwise
Bleeding from your lip is a whole other level
I am drinking a dos Equis and I am happy
This beer actually tastes very decent and I can't taste the alcohol
I am becoming a college kid... fuck
You spanked them back...? Hahaha what?! You have to explain. My spankings were with a belt, multiple times at once. I'm not against spanking but I am against excess.
Lol I also enjoy dos equis and I am not a college kid
Drinking beer makes me feel patriotic and relevant
It's just really smooth and I love the hips beers with subtle flavors like citrus
The best drinks are drinks when you can't even taste the alcohol. I miss V's summer bartending skills.
How did your parents agree to let you drink one
I mean they would hit me and I would say f that and hit them back (lightly) when they irritated me 
Yeah no not with a belt!!! Just a hand. It wasn't even with much force
God yes
Like the Grapefruit drinks
I was just like hey do you want to split a beer mom
And she was like ok
And so she got a bit and I got most of it
You got drunk with your mom, bish
You know I didn't think colleges I visited were that liberal and Diviya said I was delusional and then I remembered that at every club you start by saying your name and your pronouns...
It's like an actual thing
I had a chick from India trying to explain it to me while I internally laughed
There is this tumblr dedicated to the experiences of FTM guys on grindr and they are such stuck up assholes. Whenever people ask them questions they get so offended, like shit, fuck you for complimenting on a hookup app or wanting a few specifics before banging someone. Like they won't even answer what surgery they have
Alright well goodnight
Hi sorry I'm not asleep
My grandpa was talking to me
lol yeah I don't know how you didn't know about how liberal colleges are. All of the college students I follow on tumblr are always complaining about representation and always posting about the most SJW events known to man.
Even at ASU there's that community.
Oh can you send the link!
What I don't get are the obvious pronouns 
Like he's gay and his name is Zach, why does he need to put he/his
A washed and blow dried cow
Alright well you are probably asleep haha so goodnight! See you tomorrow 💕
This looks like yours 
The first couple are pretty legitimately ridiculous but after that they are bitches
Have seen dat cow but love it
Zach is probably ftm if he lists pronouns
Bradford also lists pronouns lol
That warms my heart 💗 it's such a beautiful one too.
"We're here, we're queer, and we're on grindr" and it's literally titled Trans n on Grindr
You don't think some of that is offensive?
Some, yes. Others, no
Lol probably at his sister's behest but point taken
I think the way some people phrase their questions is not all that appropriate
Also CPS isn't here yet...
Last night all I did was hang clothes and listen to Adam Lambert and Lana
I might meet you guys there or see you after
Ok, I'll still text when I'm in the area to make sure
Ohhhh wait
I'm an hour ahead
I love lambert's look but hate his music lol
I was wondering why she wasn't here yet
Yes it is 9:23
Yeah...
Lol ok nvm then
I just woke up so early and I didn't sleep and my schedule is so fucked
CPS cancelled
HAHAHAHAHA 
Ok I'll pick you up then
After Nate though please
My mom got super pissed at me and we got into this huge argument
Ok why is she angry tho
I'll explain later
Come out bish
Park in front
Hi
What are you guys talking about???
Cute
We stopped talking three min ago because Diviya wanted to finish her thing and Madeleine is asleep
It's 11 now alarm went off
Ya I know
Checkout is 12
I'm getting out now 
Punud
Gratuitouspublicnudity
Herhunter
Johnlovesbeinglocked
Keroiam
1) I've been passed out all evening but good luck on your SRP tomorrow 😘
2) is Wednesday an okay day for you to pick me up after school? Or if I'm not at school then to pick me up from home
Wednesday I can but I am busy at 6 unless you want to come volunteer 
Watch this before your presentation and feel good: 
Where are you volunteering?
  
Also look at this movie night I got invited to, lol
What does Viagra do for females
That's depressing as fuck
SAAG
SAAF
Whoops it's already over. Will check the video out when I get home
Mm I think it is just a vasodilator for females
Good for heart
It's hosted by a cemetery lol...
I know
How did it go? And how were the others?
I had two dreams about you 
1) We met like 20 years later at some airport and we were both with our significant others. Through lunch we realized how bad the relationships were and we left to go fuck in a bathroom while the others did the same
2) you came to the school because you wanted to go out to lunch with me and pick me up, but you hadn't told me yet. I was talking to Jennifer when you came so you talked to Martha right next to me. I hadn't seen you yet but when I walked over to the Zayna group you decided to not even bother. Then you found some other random gay and went with him.
Also in my dreams there were weird interludes. I went to some spooky birthday party and there were brains in some box. And then another one was that I turned the oven on and accidentally left a bunch of things inside, so I had to go inside and clean it while it was still hot.
It went well and the others were super cool
Why the beyonce
Your two dreams sound like opposites
Maybe this explains why Madeleine, white but yet still marginalized, is sassy. I actually don't really buy this article. I think they're forcing relations to race and oppression to explain something almost universal to all people.
And how would one explain sass in someone who is growing up now and doesn't have to overcome social adversity?
That's great!!!
What are you doing today?
Also are you going to the loft tomorrow
Beyoncé to share the fine details of the dress.
And the body lol
I really think shade is about rivalry with people of a similar status
"(A Google search for the words "Cookie", "Empire", and "shade" results in almost half a million hits.)"
Those last three lines are super passive aggressive, damn.
Lol I forgot graduation is on Wednesday
Oops lol, never mind then I'm sorry
I think it's about how it would originate in the oppressed not about how it is about oppression in 2015
Like its a popular trend for all now
I am not doing anything today
Movie today or tomorrow whatever
I love the hamster
Did you check out the Craigslist link
I saw a thing that said that the israeli Palestinian conflict is like an uncircumcised penis because when you finally think it's done it is just all up in your face again or something. Don't get why it must be uncircumcised 
Using uncircumcised is shade, don't you get it
:P
But really though I don't get that either. Bad analogy.
You're going to watch a movie today?
No, basically I want to have you free on an evening because I want to have a picnic with you
Also the loft "not your usual bedtime story" screening is tomorrow at 10am
Yes hahaha. Do you find yourself getting more turned on by the advertisement itself than the pic
That's what I felt
Reyna messaged me right as I got home yesterday and asked if I wanted to go out. I could barely type my response because I was already falling asleep.
Oh ok that is cool too yeah I will go to div's thing tomorrow
Absolutely lol. But it wasn't really that I was turned on, I just found it so over the top. I am sure the guy isn't actually attractive if that's the best photo he can muster lol 
Did you respond
Yeah I did haha. Also I accidentally called Panteha over Facebook messenger because I couldn't see clearly when I woke up last night.
Do you want to know something sad
The preschool my brother graduated from is unable to provide scholarships to many families next year (it was cut by 53%) due to decreases in the Tobacco Tax income which supplied funds for the scholarships
the preschool is relatively inexpensive and the primary demographic is low income families. Many of the parents look like tobacco users or heavy drug users.
I just found that interesting
This is why we need legal weed
What do you find so appealing about the craigslist ads? Is it that It is a real person 
It's like erotica tailored towards men
So I need to know about picnic in advance, I'll let Diviya know, and we should also see a movie this week
Is Reyna free tonight
It would be fun to hang
I'll be free around 8:30 tonight I think
How would legal weed help when the scholarship is funded by tobacco tax lol
Weed tax to replace
It must feel nice when you find ads that are relevant to you and the guy describes you
It already looks kinda bad that their funds are dependent on tobacco tax, I couldn't imagine weed tax
No it looks good for weed
It is the case in Colorado
All the weed tax goes to education 
Who cares what pays for new scholarships as long as they have them. 
Hi sorry I was in the shower, for literally almost an hour.
I actually didn't know that though
Reyna says maybe and James is also a maybe
Why the sudden Reyna obsession hmmmmm?
Is it so you can interview her about Elliot to get more evidence lol
Oh you just brought her up
Do you think people with intellectual disabilities can consent? Does it matter if the partner is disabled? Where do we draw the line, there are some obviously not able to consent cases but where does it end? 
And if an individual can't consent can they be held accountable for rape, given that we are saying they can't understand sex?
Suuuuuuuuuuure. Well Reyna says count her out.
I think if it's to the point where one isn't able to function in society and has a trend of making abnormal decision, sex should not be a concern. they shouldn't be fit to have sex and nobody should try to instigate it with them unless the person is instigating it themselves under those conditions.
But like I've heard of elderly couples where one has dementia
And the other was accused of sexual harassment because the one with dementia couldn't consent
In those cases I just think the one with dementia is unfit for sex
I don't think it's right to charge for sexual harassment at all though, especially if they're married
How do you feel
My shave gel smells like you :)
Can we still go even tho Reyna can't
What shave gel is it
Ya what do you want to do
I don't really have an answer 
I think for me personally if there was someone with intelligence comparable to that of Down's Syndrome that it would be wrong of me to do them. But I guess they could be able to understand what is going on so they could consent. It's tricky.
Oh! Lost River is playing at 9:45 and we can do coffee and taboo before.
I think it's a Gillette
What's lost River about
Yeah but I guess we don't really know how capable they are of understanding. It's different for each case so it's best to play it safe. I guess there are so many people in the world that you could have sex with someone else
It's the Ryan gosling film
Taxi driver?
Your choice, just wanted to mention it is on at 10
Does lost river look unappealing?
Maybe but I'll probably fall asleep during the movie hahah
Doesn't it make you uncomfortable to watch videos or movies or shows on your phone
No it doesn't sound bad. I'll  watch the trailer again. What time is it at again
Mm I think it is lesser but I am not uncomfortable
As you sent that I was watching glee on my phone (not a common occurrence)
Omg I'm at a dinner fundraiser and I thought some kid said "I'm being oppressed!" And I burst out laughing and then he was like "I said I'm being depressed..."
It's at 9:45 I think
subtitles on phones make me uncomfortable
Hahahahah
I have three stories to tell you. 
Actually tonight won't work for me, I'm too tired.
Alright I understand 
Sorry btw I spaced
I anticipate your three stories at a later time
Yeah it's fine
I'm sorry I've been super unresponsive I just feel like shit and my head hurts. I'm really really sick 😕
I think once I get home I'm going to go to sleep
How has your day been
Glee all day? Or did you complete a task in your list?
I had forgotten about a senior party
So I'm at that
Other than that, glee
Like a legit senior party?
Or is it clean?
Clean but I think there is an after party
Oh are you gonna go to that
Guess so
Cool alright then
Have fun
How is it
Just got here idk yet
I had meant in general but ok
Oh
Haley's mom is here
Is her mom one of the Diviya moms except that she stays lol
Does that usually happen
Ya
 I lost at beer pong
I have had like 2 beers and a shot 
Ouch I guess your Dartmouth and brown skills didn't pay off
How does that make you feel hmm
Who won?
It's literally been like 30 min lol I can't believe you've already had that much
I guess beers are smooth and it's kinda like drinking water
Isn't this so trashy
He's in like 9th grade
Fuck I am drunk
Yuan bin won
Who is he
YUAN BIN?!!!!! No fucking way
Aimee I swear you're lying to me
Wow, damn. Go him. I never knew that was his deal.
Apparently he does have this secret mad party life
He's my boo
Or maybe yuan bin has been to things before and you just never mentioned it
Any other surprises? Does Mackenzie drink?
Also I'm sorry I feel like I've been bothering you all day
No she doesn't
You aren't bothering me
Hi
Hi hahah
Are you okay
Saskia posted this picture of Hailey signing shawn's booty
What's going on now
I did not witness that
I am fine
All is well
I feel so great
Alex Ellinwood is here
Apparently he needs to go to the Russian draft
Well that's good. Are you 🌿🌿🌿
I didn't know he knew any seniors. He looks 14.
But being drafted has always been one of my top 10 fears
Like it physically makes me sick to think about and I start shaking
When does he have to go? Ugh, I think the situation is so unfortunate.
I'm sure a majority of american Russians wish they weren't even associated with Russia in a militaristic sense right now
I am now
He is a family friend of Caitlin I think
He doesn't have to go
He just has to sign up like selective service
So is he a dual citizen or just Russian?
Idk
I'm a hipster
No you ain't bitch you only know like 1 Lana song
Caitlin descibed me as hipster 
I remember when I first heard hipster in speech and I thought it was some dance move where you shake your hips
She didn't know I was near
What was the context
I've spent the past hour listening to old Amy Winehouse it's the shit
Oh I first heard the word hipster in some Mac Miller song Gloria showed me
What are some of your biggest fears
Aside from the draft, I fear addiction to drugs or alcohol.
Being inferior
Becoming dumber 
We all joked at your hipster dance
Gloria <3
Being inferior and dumber to whom?
Any large group 
Lol was "Gloria <3" a sarcastic text
That's fair. Not my biggest fear because it's something you can escape
My biggest fears (draft, addiction) are difficult to leave 
The ones that take ahold of you or are forceful 
Omg do you remember when Courtney love said nigger? Diviya and I got on the ground and said "hands up don't shoot" and "we didn't go to ferguson for this shit"
Charlotte has no gag reflex she says
Hahahahahaha yes
But is that like actually preferable
I am neutral
Challenge her to suck off a Popsicle and prove it
Or better yet
Suck off a guy right now and then hear his review lol 
"You can be teletubies and beat Reza up and you can be la la and you can be dipsy wispy. He has a pimpin Dalmatian hat and he's kinda gay"
-Malec
Fucked up people are literally more difficult to comprehend than physics lol 
I'm not sure if I should ask for an explanation
And more importantly
I'm not even sure if you can explain it yourself haha :)
I kinda want an explanation though so if you're ready shoot for it
He was angry at reza
And likes the teletubbies
Hahahah
Well mister i have to get up kinda early for that film tomorrow at the loft. I'll see you later, have fun and stay safe. Goodnight ❤️
FUCK
?
U ok?
Ya
It's just early
Oh, yeah. Kinda.
If you can't go I understand.
Gil has received cranium 
Wish you came to these so we could tag team
He received cranium the board game?
Lol nobody told me about cranium how would I know
Those were two separate statements
Tag team in what?
You mean in terms of sex
?
Tag team in call of duty
How long is the sex Ed video
I'm not sure
Are you coming 
What happened
It was kinda scary because at first I was alone in the house and I could see him in the backyard and he looked kinda disconcerted
But then he asked me if I wanted to give the dog a bath
In the end it's not really his call and it's my life
I was really nervous though
You know the "why do we need professors" NYT article was really insightful
It talked about how on a 50s and 60s college survey approx. 80% of students wanted to get a different perspective on life and many students had intellectual discussions with professors and used them as resources
When now the 80% answer is that students want a successful job and a good paycheck and around 33% of students meet with professors and only attend classes but don't scrutinize the material
That's also due to teachers focusing on their individual research as well and they might not always have time
But it was an interesting education experience shift
*33% never talk to professors outside of class
"Received cranium" I love that phrase hahaha
Honestly I think it is missing the obvious reason
That back then college was for the wealthy and privileged who would have had jobs no matter what, and the world has just changed. And so of course they had lofty reasons for education. Now it has expanded to all as a means for upward mobility. 
I bet those upper class students still see it as a way to grow now. 
It's simply a matter of the expansion of the institution beyond those striving to enter academia or other upper echelons
Yes!!! That is literally the best response. I was going to say that along with the inundation of students not in the upper classes came the idea that college is primarily for social advancement and eventually doing something profitable. But I don't think someone like you or Charlotte or the wealthiest people will even attempt to dive into material, and really money is the language of success these days. I think it's rare to further your education because people who do end up becoming researchers or professors themselves unless you have a job secured. It's just kinda unfortunate because the concept is even prevalent in our high school, where only Jay and Joseph take advantage of Rosinbum or Connolly other very intelligent people and challenge their views, and other students focus on the grade and the goal to get them into college.
Like it's unnecessarily instilled in high school and I think teachers should make more advances and show students that they want to have discussions and they want to share books, like Connolly and Rosinbum do
Because I think all of us can be fairly successful in life and have decent grades in college if intellectual expansion is the risk
Wait so you are saying you don't think wealthy people are doing it for personal expansion either?
Wait do you mean it is the risk
What*
Well, you know some people just don't like literature or philosophy (me)
Not everyone has to strive to be that kind of intellectual
I'm saying to some extent they do but the culture today depends on profit and salary
That we can engage in those discussions and not slave ourselves to the routine and classes. Occasionally get out of our comfort zone and chat with our professors. It's not going to cost us a grade. Like I'm basically saying it's kinda silly not to use our professors because there isn't a risk, except "wasted time".
And that certainly isn't the only type of intellectual. I love talking to Billings about history on a personal level and asking things I would have been afraid to ask in class.
It doesn't depend on that for those that don't need to work for a living
And those are the people I'm talking about, the old inherited money
I think and hope that many will break out of their shy shells in college. It is far too early to write them off
So then do you think they get the most out of an elite or university education?
Rather than anybody else?
They are most able to get the most out of it but often don't I would say. 
The ones who aren't wealthy and want to succeed in humanities push themselves more to succeed 
And even if it doesn't make $ sense to go to an elite university for humanities, tons and tons of people with and without money do it anyway.
So, in theory, yes, in practice, eh.
Well some students just aren't into that and engage in their own ways
I just think that you are making it out that your way is THE way. Sure I don't think Rainy is right at all in her way, but Helena might be. 
And you have to remember that each person is just that-- a person. Multifaceted even if it isn't clear. You can't reduce them to pawns in an argument like that. I assure you that Holly has thoughts that don't involve her career, she just doesn't express them to you and I often. 
Sorry that was unnecessarily harsh 
Idk today
I really saw Diviya's way in a new light
And Martha's. And it inspired me. 
I think there is a quiet beauty to their ways.
And how Diviya does all of this really because she doesn't know what else to do with herself. It is her life. I need to make my work my life, because I can never be the winner without falling in love with what I study and do, like her. 
I'm not saying my way is THE way. The thing I am pushing for is for people to explore the material they are studying, which in college largely pertains to your interests and classes germane to your career, which is why I can't understand why you're attacking me! If anything, I'm saying that you should strive to make your interests what's important. I like history and I go to billings and read the textbook and read about civil rights and salutary neglect because I love it and I want to incorporate history into my career somehow. You think I don't see the beauty of Diviya's ways? She is literally one of the people who inspired me to work harder. Sure I think she neglects herself some social time when school is her top priority, but I admire her dedication and affinities.
I just think that in college it is all so high level that there is no choice to not explore the material
It's true in high school, sure, and at the U of Arizona or other average schools, but not among the elite
Yes, definitely at the elite colleges are you given the opportunity to do so, where you are literally taking no gen eds :( the course load makes it significantly more difficult to explore material because on top of that you have to balance everything, unless you use AP credits
How are gen ed classes working for you actually?
at brown
Do you just not take them?
Open curriculum
No gen eds. 100% free choice of classes. 
FUCK
Ok let me just say the other ivies have a shitton of required courses
that's so good, damn
That's why I chose Brown
Ok but gen eds aren't necessarily a bad word 
If you have a variety of interests you can take awesome courses that count for gen Ed
Actually they mostly just have requirements of areas-- not courses. But still it is a lot. Especially Columbia, fuck.
Like you don't have to take chemistry 140 but you have to take a chemistry
Actually tho since I am doing pre med I might as well have gen eds
So many requirements
1 year general chemistry, 1 year organic chemistry, 1 year biology, 1 year physics (FUCK MY LYFEEEEE), 1 year ENGLISH, 1 semester math, and now they are adding behavioral science and humanities for next year
So I might as well have gone somewhere with distributions. Fuck premed
Hahahah those requirements are literally classes you would be taking elsewhere. At least you don't have to take them every year so you are kinda lucky. Do you know any other schools that offer open curriculum?
Also do you plan on going to brown med school?
And why would English and a humanities be required??
Sorry though I was eating dinner and brewing some tea
You know Xóchitl never really engaged in class but she is obviously an interesting person
I hate engaging in class
Groups freak me out and I only function well with one on one or small groups
But I see your point
Do you know what she wants to do?
Yes! Amherst, Wesleyan, Grinnell
And Williams has like very few small requirements
Lol schools I can get into pls
Sarah Lawrence I think
Grinnell you have a shot at
And Sarah Lawrence for sure 
Even Wesleyan I believe is within the range of possibility. Steven got in 
I hate groups too
But I meant like xochi didn't really talk to teachers or like anything
No I do not plan on going to their med school, it isn't very good
And would be $$$
I think she wants to do robotics or engineering of some kind
Idk why it is required
How is the tea
I am going to finish this book And The Band Played On  this week
You might like it. It is very long but it is very interesting. The gay politics of the 80's can be felt today. It's a history book, really. I think it exemplifies what I love about the field
Literally I was going to ask to read the book this week because I thought you would never get around to it
That is such a crazy coincidence
Looking into Sarah Lawrence I think that's where I have the best chance 
Where do you plan on going to med school?
Question:
Did your passion for AIDS stem from a desire to find a lucrative career and go to med school or is it something you were passionate about regardless of money?
Bc most of my interests don't depend on money
Really though I feel like I want a very comfortable life and it would be nice
What sparked the change from economist to epidemiologist 
I took Post-AP Econ and realized I was idealizing things. 
And that I don't actually enjoy the material. 
And it was all passion
The one money consideration was that I shifted from wanting to be a PhD researcher to an MD. But also I think researchers mostly do grants so it was a passion decision too
That's so weird 
I'm thinking either U of Arizona (which I'm perfectly happy with) or UCSF or Emory if my grades and MCAT are great. 
Fuck I feel like shit
I'm sorry I've been napping
You're right about Madeleine. She's literally a giant ball of fury and irascibility 
Wouldn't PhD researcher be more beneficial for society though...?
What would you be doing as an MD
Something that kinda upsets me sometimes is when everyone complains they have the worst life ever and they make life shitty for others because of this "reason"
That's what she reminds me of
When like literally I can topple her town w all the shit I went through the past 5 months
*down
Although we all deal with things differently and I definitely shouldnt discredit her struggle
Ok I still overall like Madeleine lol I don't think she is a ball of fury. She just needs to take a chill pill or 5.
Yes it would be more beneficial probably but I'm not basing my decision on that. I'm already going to benefit society and I'm not going to be sad and poor because I chose to help society that extra little bit
What happened to cause you to be upset with Madeleine
One small example of the undue influence of the LDS church in Utah.
You don't have to read all of them, it is just many sources to vouch for accuracy
The church itself should not solicit donations for such a political cause nor should it encourage its members to contribute to a cause that is in another state. This is one of the many things about the church.

Good morning. I just woke up and had the coolest dream kinda involving a church not really though
Basically I was swimming in the Colorado river and trying to escape my dad's family who wanted to impose Muslim law in the workplace. I had to climb rocks and waterfalls to get back to society and warn them about the plan, which involved breaking into some house when they were already inside the house and sneaking out of windows
Anyway I made it to society and had to protest with people getting off of busses because the Muslim law wanted to ban public transportation. People were spraying pepper spray at the passengers and stuff
Then all of a sudden I ran into Rihanna and had to stop to take a selfie 
But there were other dreams too where Keizer said he liked me and I kept ignoring him and didn't make him a Valentine's, but I made one for Kristie.
And then some dream where you were able to intercept all of my messages and join all of my group chats and you got upset with me for some reason
I'll reSd yore things in a min
Hi
Those are some weird dreams
Hey sorry I'm reading the first article right now. There's a limit on the amount of students allowed to pay in-state tuition??!
Glad that dream-you has his priorities straight
Oh they balance it out by lowering in state and increasing out of state
Honestly though I think that's the best way to go
But I guess I'm just saying that because I'm guaranteed financial aid
I was upset because Martha showed me the texts Madeleine sent her and they were excessively bitchy 
Well that's because Arizona doesn't do that, they accept many many in state students with a high rate of admission. The same cannot be said for other states
Any quotes?
How exactly does the church bolster itself in industries it has no business in? Like I get the motive for prohibition but what makes them so powerful that board members take their opinions into consideration?
Is it all financial based?
No not at all
The entire state of Utah is mormon. They think that the church leadership literally speaks to God. So if you go against them you are literally going against god's wishes
The board members are probably mormon
Idk if you caught the line that said that they should have some people who consume alcohol on the board. They didn't before because it was 100% mormon
Damn the newest episode of This American Life is so good
It's about values in upbringing
Sex, race
And tradition and how society shapes our views and stuff
What are you doing today?
lol did you catch the line about how having a woman is tantamount to putting a drug addict on the narcotics board
Really though these articles don't taint my view on the Mormon population I know
Just the church. And personally church institutions have always been flawed, not the people per se.
I went to lunch with family friend
And now at Diviya's are you coming?
I agree. But I am upset they feed into that
I'll check it out
No I'm not
How are you
Sorry I was eating so I couldn't talk earlier. Wasn't  ignoring 
Well I finished the podcast and it reinforced all the reasons why I don't want kids. Baby fever and maternal/paternal desire isn't enough.
I'm ok. Studying for bio and going to watch a movie.
Wbu
Yeah I'll check it out sounds great
Do you feel prepared
How did today go
What movie
I'm swimming
I'm always prepared for bio. There isn't too much to know.
I thought you couldn't swim???
Today was kinda uneventful but I started a few projects and made a schedule
The Spectacular Now
How is your day going
I can't put my chest fully in for extended periods 
So I just stay with my arms on the outside
Oh I want to see that
What projects?
It's going pretty awesome
Started college app, finalized summer plans, made a college list, SRP stuff, and made a new appropriate email
You are so on top of things
I've forgotten how great it was to watch a new movie
And like feel things inside
from the movie
I only did those things because I feel like everyone else already has
Diviya's mom wants Diviya to call her
What things do you feel?!?
lol why do you sound like I just admitted support for Hamas or something
Oh I was just curious
I am so horny SERGIO
Didn't mean to capitalize
Well I was watching the movie and alongside reading roger ebert's review. It just made the experience more intense and personal for me.
Oh :(
Also the movie felt like my life right now
And like all the things I have gone through in terms of parents and boys and school
Like it captured my pre-focused and transitioning self
In such a beautiful way
Well I've been home all day not doing anything 
Ok I'll watch it tonight haha
I wish I went swimming damn it
Oh :(
Also something funny is that the girl's name is Aimee, exactly
It always bothered me hearing my name on the big screen
Btw it's on Australian Netflix
And btw again
You are everything to me and I couldn't be happier❤️
In case you didn't know
That is so strange
I am so happy to be with you
What are your plans tomorrow?
My mom will be going out with some guy tomorrow and Wednesday night 
I know Wednesday is grad night
Are we doing a party at your place on Friday night
Tomorrow at school 
But I will have free time from like 1:30-3:30
And I think I have Friday plans perhaps so no 
Do you want to send photos?
Sorry that today didn't pan out, didn't realize you were free
I was going to send but I thought you were with doviya 
Why are you at school tomorrow?
Well I was sick last night and decided to stay home because I didn't know how I would feel
In the morning I was eh but I felt better throughout the day
Just got home
A bit ago
At school for grad pictures and D&D
what symptoms have you been having
Do you actually know how to play d&d? 
Just fatigue and body aches and a cough
I always get sick around exam/finals season though
Where'd you and doviya go??
Yeah I used to play a lot 
Oh
We went to a hot dog place and smoked
She smoked on three separate occasions today
I am actually going to sleep so goodnight 
Oh
Okay well
Goodnight
Only bc up at 4am and feeling used
What's up
Finished my bio final wbu
Gonna be at schools in 3
That you like grabbed my head and went in as far as possible and made me choke during a bj and that I almost threw up and was coughing 
Ok you know
The black guy on this american life actually I really disagree with him
Which one?
You should come
Shit I wanted to
Oh wait nvm by the time you get here you can only stay an hour
Nvm
I just didn't think it was appropriate to ask
Unless
Yeah exactly
We hang after
Yeah I'm down but
Maybe I can just n
et you somewhere?
Like you go home with someone like Diviya and I'll pick you up
Yeah I'll be at Diviya's around 8 and we can talk hahaha
??
?
Nvm
If you're too tired though it's okay
Bc Diviya can't come with us
She doesn't "want to do anything fun" or "intense" tonight
I might be a little tired too though, I'm sorry. But I had lots of fun with you today!
Why do you disagree with him?
Aight 
I'll tell you later, enjoy your party
Hey boo
What's up?
What was your statement
Actually Bo
Ok so the angry dad guy
No tell me 
I felt he went a step too far
The one who openly rejected integration?
"I think the white man in America is doing very well and I have no concern for his well-being"
Yeah
I don't think that is a constructive way to look at things
Nor to generalize "the white man"
Exactly that's exactly how I felt
It's taking a stride away from equality
Precisely
I'm a white guy. My dad is from North Africa because his people were kicked out of the Iberian peninsula by the inquisition. My mom's family was kicked out of east Europe by antisemitic sentiment if lucky, and if unlucky killed by hitler. I am a second generation immigrant. My people have suffered immensely as well, and yes I benefit from white privilege but no I am not the descendant of any oppressor of yours, so don't generalize. 
I just think his jaded view is not "badass" it's harmful.
I just do not understand why suddenly radicalism and racism is the new progressive as long as the mouth piece isn't white
And honestly I was disturbed that this perspective was being promoted on public radio. This is what I mean about my beef with npr. It's not that I have a problem with him expressing his view, I have a problem with the fact that the guy hosting the segment only offered him praises. It made it seem like his way was unquestionably correct. 
"I wasn't sure about you but then I saw how many white people got mad about what you wrote and that convinced me that you were probably alright"
I really think the success of an equal society is contingent upon acknowledgement of oppression and the ability to forgive and move forward. Honestly a lot of the problems stem from the past and dwelling on the past. the number of lynchings today are substantially lower than ever before, nearly nonexistent. Raising your children with those race dichotomies is disgusting. Tell them the stories and the history, but also tell them that things are better now. Tell them that everybody overcomes adversity no matter what race or gender or whatever they are.
It also disturbed me too
And like when he was talking about how his daughter's response in church was natural I got really upset
"tell him about the church incident" like it was some funny joke.
So insensitive to emotions non-black (aka oppressed) people feel
There really is no way to rationalize that man's behavior. He is successful and what more can he want?
*his attitude
Yes I feel the exact same way. Really he is one of many that feel this way, but most of those are young and have no impact on others. And I'm not just speaking regarding race-- this whole toxic social justice thing. What caused the spike in riots recently, I would say, is this combative sentiment, not any action or inaction on the part of any governing institutions 
Honestly though, I don't think he conducts himself on a day to day basis consistently with that fiery rhetoric. His white bogeyman doesn't exist, at least not in fucking Berkeley, CA.
Ok goodnight 
I'm sad that I probably won't live to see the discovery of alien civilizations. It will be truly revolutionary. 
What if they have other senses
The possibilities are infinite
Or even crazier, what if they have massive similarities to ourselves
We tend to get so self-involved in society we have created that should theoretically benefit us. It causes us so much worry. Maybe one day I will step away from that. Maybe that's what Connolly knows that we don't. 
Holy shit Aimee I had the best fucking dream ever
We were in the army together for 4 years
I'm sorry though I fell asleep early but got the best sleep
And like we got to fight a bunch of people but it was sad when we got back into civilization. Reyna and Nate were in college already and were together. All of our friends were in college except us and we were so behind on things.
I was thinking about the existence of aliens earlier this week too and how there is such a high chance of things existing.
I really do believe in aliens like we can't be the only things
How is Connolly the one more detached from our society than say you?
She is such a stereotypical person. Yoga, reads the news, watches Netflix, hosts dinner parties. Her ideas are fascinating but she is still very involved in the world.
Aimee, God that was the best dream I've ever had. I literally went through four years in a bunker with you. And like I got raped, we had to go through boot camp, we had to save this girl who almost died, we learned how to become war machines, climb mountains.
Very very very high intensity
I guess there's always this fear of the unknown though. Like I'm terrified to know if there are aliens. I don't know what intellectual level they're at, what they're capable of, if they're a hostile or amicable force.
your view about alien civilizations is surprisingly optimistic and I think for something like that we can't be
Also in my dream I gave you head except I went inside of you and it was sparkling inside and I could walk around and move things hahah
Well like how she left her PhD program cos it wasn't making her happy
How did you feel about your rape
I don't think us discovering them means them discovering us, and so I am optimistic 
That it won't be war because they won't know we saw them
Like your whole body went inside me?
What did you move around
Oh yes! And she is one of the happiest person I know. Yesterday Diviya said that she wishes she could pursue her dreams but that she wants a comfortable lifestyle aka money.
The rape actually got you more upset than I was
Great differentiation!
Yes my whole body. I was like pushing against the interior walls hahah
Do you have an extra graduation ticket...?
Sorry if it's inconvenient
Yeah I think I do
Sorry I was on a driving lesson
That is so strange. What color was it
It was pink and purple and sparkly haha
And you were talking to me while I was inside
Ok cool thanks bar
Bae 
That is a bit strange lol
I don't think of my insides as pink and purple and sparkly
When we use the glow in the dark condom I want to leave it inside of you so you're glowing
Why'd you have a driving class?
This morning I went to ihop w Martha, Ahmad, Diviya, and Nate, and now we're at agua caliente
How are you feeling today
Are you ready for graduation
Lol that might be ok
Wow, jealous! That sounds so fun
Yeah I feel fine, don't really feel much
My mom wanted me to be sure I was good on highway
What are you doing after grad?
Oh that's cool I hope it went well
No idea, there might be something, idk
What up
We're hanging at Diviya's house
Gonna pre game on fruity wine hahah
what's up with you?
Did you actually get to drive on the highway?
The pink wine? It's so good
Yeah for like an hour
I actually got to drive on it my first time ever really driving which was my first driving lesson
It was scary as hell
He was like, ok you have been driving for an hour lets go to the highway!
I Have your ticket with me, let me know when you get here
No no it was a big bottle of something hahah but not pink. It was yellow and said pinot
That is fucking awesome!!!
Go you!!!
Prepping you for the road trip haha
Ok thank you :)
When does graduation end?
Around 8
I'm here
Madeleine will find you with the ticket
I got it, thanks!
Where you at
I'm near the entrance
With all the juniors
Where are you???
Be there soon
Where you at
The front near the stairs
By the box office
Hope you have a great night ❤️
Yeah you too
But like there was anticipation and it was a bit upsetting
That's all
Seriously though it's your night and I'm sorry for that
I'm confused at what upset you but I'm sorry.
You're going to think this is the stupidest thing ever
But I wanted to hug you and kiss you
I just felt like it was right
I wanted to too
I am sorry
I am sorry too Aimee, you are the best person in my life.
Have so much fucking fun!!!
I'll see you all this week and we can party hard
U r GR8
Let's party hard
I'm so drunk 
Have a good night
Lol I am still able to speak to you
Stay drunk, amigo
🍻🍻🍻
I saw that
Yes, you liked it on my tumblr and it made me very happy
Anyway I'll leave you alone haha
 How is your night going
Best party ever
My night is eh lol
I've been having an allergic reaction to the cat
Why is it the best party ever??
Are there any quotable moments
I will not recall in the morn
Hello 
It was like the first time I ever felt loved
Lol jk
What 
I'm feeling so good
Why is that
There's a slight buzz
You will not recall in the morning but do you recall now
Somewhat
You guys are on something?
We are high on life
It's so scary how our parents could read text messages and find out how fucked up kids are
Unlikely
Who is there
Is it at Jennifer's 
Just Zayna and Jennifer but we are gonna have to cook food for Joseph now :/
Like fancy shit. Salmon and edamame 
And macaroni and cheese
Do people dance at your parties
Not really we just sit around
Oh okay
How are things 
You like totally disregard everything lol
My head hurts and Lana is all over the place
How are you?
Your things
imeeeeee
Why did you cook for Joseph
Today is his Joseph
Oops
Today is his birthday
Yes I know!
Yeah and I guess him and Jen are gonna spend the day together and one of her presents to him is food lol
How are you feeling though
We accidentally slept through an alarm so idk if I'm going to school or not haha
 Hi
Sorry I was at breakfast with Sweeney
I felt so bad this morning
Well not hungover
I just still feel buzzed. Which is ridiculous 
Did you go to school 
Oh where'd you two go?
Her and I and some other seniors went to bobo's
I'm sorry b :( I feel so refreshed and I had a banana and a cup of tea
No I'm probably just gonna go home at like 1
I'm still at Jen's
And I realized
That I absolutely love cats more than anything!!!!
😻😻😻
What are you up to now?
What is bobo's specialty? Is it just regular breakfast food?
I love cats too!
I just got home so I am debating going to sleep, watching Netflix, or fucking around on my phone for a bit longer
It's cheap american food
A sure step up from Waffle House
How was your sleepover 
But like I never understood the cat craze until this morning. I just woke up and cuddled with the cat for an hour before everyone else woke up.
The best thing is falling asleep while watching Netflix
And then having interesting dreams about what you just watched lol
I just had salmon and Mac and cheese w artichoke and spinach
The sleepover was alright. How was your party?
My party was pretty great 
That sounds like an... Interesting combination
What Netflix you be watching
Hey
It was a great combination! Basically Jennifer made too much food for Joseph and had to get rid of it lol
Right now I am sitting outside of my house because nobody is home
What did you end up doing or watching?
Look at this glorious outfit 
I am so relaxed
What time is Reza's graduation?
Oh also the salmon and the macaroni & cheese were on separate plates
Hey what's up 
Lol well I finally got inside my house and I showered and helped my grandpa in the garage. I've just been lying down and thinking for a while. Wbu?
I was actually thinking about the time we had perfect sex and I was about to start jerking off
But my phone was accidentally put on ringer mode so
Lol
Lol
I just woke up
From a long nap
And I feel shitty but not as tired 
I'm sorry about that. Are you okay enough to go to Reza's?
I feel a little shitty too because of my cat allergies
Also it just feels like nothing exciting has been happening with me
And I don't like that feeling
I'll probably see Far from the Madding Crowd tomorrow.
Wow that sucks that you are allergic to cats
Why that movie
I think I'll go
Maybe you got me sick lol
I feel the same way about myself
Well you always refuse to get near me or kiss me so idk how you got sick
Jk lol. It probably was me.
I know! My throat and nose are still so irritated and I was tearing up in my sleep.
Ummmm Carey mulligan is in it?!!!
at least I'll be busy almost all of June though so I don't feel completely useless
Well have fun!
Hey sorry I was in the shower
I think what I am experiencing is hangover. This is unfortunate
Love Carey mulligan
Any plans this weekend?
AIMEEEE
I'm sorry
You are awesome
I think I have had one before too minus the vomiting that is supposed to happen.
Do you remember most of the party last night or is it a blur?
This weekend I am seeing The Room and going to Joseph's on Saturday and then I'm free the rest of the weekend
I wanted to have a picnic with you during the week
Did you know that to talk to you it used to be incredibly hard for me so I would memorize some conversation starters and plan out a few subjects to talk about before we hung out
Also, do you know what a majority of your grade is majoring in or like what they're interested in
And what are your weekend plans?
I remember some of it. Not much happened tbh
Charlie McLean grew his hair out
Many of them want to do engineering and many have no idea
Many want biology
Really? When did you become more comfortable
I don't think I have plans outside of Joseph's
Who is in the movie project
I'm thinking it might be weird to go
I am like the only white person at cholla
I knew Charlie had been growing his hair out long ago. Priscilla kept me updated on all the grads from her grade lol.
Well by the time you picked me up and we were out for a while I had forgotten about the things I planned and comfort came on its own each time
While that may be true the movies they're watching are also not even good. Today they watched Little Shop of Horrors, so they're actual cult films. And the bad ones!!
The unforgivably bad ones
To answer your question though it's Reyna, Brian, Bella, Zayna, and Jennifer
I probably won't go for half of the days though
Lol at Pueblo I felt like the only white person internally although i wasn't a minority on the exterior
The huge public school graduations last hourrrrrs because they have 9,000,000 fucking students
Is cholla a big school?
I never realized how much I love and missed hanging around Diviya and my other friends outside of the Zayna group
Diviya just called me to complain about not asking anyone for letters of rec so I'm most likely going to ask tomorrow
I calculated the rate at which they call graduates and estimated the end time (I did it twice) and got 8:45 and 8:51. It ended at 8:47 I rock
280 grads
Ok yeah I may or may not go only on days you do
Lol yas
Who are you gonna ask
Kirk isn't fat
Hey! Go you hahaha. You continue to fascinate me every day :)
Tomorrow I am waking up at 5 to hike with Martha and Diviya and Nate ughhhhh
Probably Swindle and the Chinese teacher
Yeah, I saw him last night and he looked completely different from what I saw last year
Xóchitl and Jenai are two of the most beautiful girls I know oh my god
Can I hiked
Hike?
For some reason I really missed Xóchitl so I decided to congratulate her
And just message her about life and stuff
of course! Martha is coming to pick me up around 5:30/5:45
And then we're going to saving canyon
*sabino
So after the hike we are going to the school (I have to return books, get yearbook, go to project. Diviya and Martha are going to go around and ask for letters of rec). Are you going to come to the project or will you just go home?
They are incredibly beautiful
Alright. I'll be there at 6.
Dunno, depends how I feel
What did xochi say
Oh okay well
?
Hm? Sorry I was thinking
Do you know what happened between Xóchitl and jay
I was about to ask jay a while ago but Elizabeth responded sooooo... 
Oh ok nvm
Anyway good night
I just finally got home, so I totally won't be up so early tomorrow :((
I'll tell you their story tomorrow
Ok
Hi
Hey
Hi
fuckkkk Emily Davis bartends at oregano's. I'm here right now.
Or no she does catering stuff but still
My brother just told me he's smokes weed
What did you say to that
Oregano's is a bad enough memory of its own
I did the stupidest thing ever but I said I do too
And that I can't imagine him doing that and it makes me uncomfortable to think about
Yeah I ate too much and I feel sick. A very unenjoyable lunch. Started my résumé though!
How was Jay's?
My mom has been guilt tripping me hard by saying I need to bond with my brother and giving me half hour long life lessons and then crying and showing me old family photos
*by saying I do too
What was for lunch?
:(
I'm actually still here
That's gonna bite you in the butt
Do you remember the months I tutored
Sept-October/Nov?
Too much pasta and silence. That's what was for lunch.
Sorry I have no idea
I thought it was summer
Oh ok
I'll talk to you later then
Fuck yeah I finished my résumé and my references
You should actually start your application online
For iHop
Alright will do
Are you ok?
Yeah sorry
Ok??
Well open interview tomorrow from 2-3pm
Just submit and then call in
Ok
Hi
I couldn't find the application
www.romulusinc.com
Anyway then, night
Thanks b
:)
Hey what's up
Sorry I was very sporadic with the texts yesterday, I was 🌿 all day
Yeah I know, Jen told me
I'm going to the restaurant around 2:30
Are you still at the farm now?
I'm sorry that I neglected to text you yesterday
No I'm on my way home first
It's okay
Are you nervous
No, I studied questions that previous iHop workers had for their interviews
I also printed my resume and references and put them in a folder
Hey sergio
Someone just called in and the lady said that they shouldn't come in today
Because 6 people are here, interviews are 15 min and so if you come in now you probably won't be interviewed
Ughhhh
You can call if you want to make sure but that's what I understood from my end of the conversation
What's up
Done
I see you
Coming
I'm actually going to see the movie at the loft if you want to come
Tickets are $3!!!
Which movie
Ok cool see you at 8 with Reyna
Wait what movie is it
Ok
Battle beyond the stars, lol
Is it good
Lol wow on the bridge
Think Troll 2 good
Do you know the history behind the bridge?
I've always wondered how people's faces got on it
Can you bring a female condom
Yes so it was built not long ago
They had residents of downtown photographed to be tiled
And ok
Well goodnight!
Have a great first day tomorrow 😉
Goodnight! You too
What is Tess's old tumblr handle
Hey
New: bajablastmeintheass
Old: k0enig-is-a-god
How did it go
Alright
Kids were dumb
I still had fun
Thanks
How was your day
They could not understand dilutions
Fine
Kids were touchy
I pet some horses
You're welcome
Applied to Bookman's, Buffalo Ex, and Savers
Ok I'm jk. I thought it would be fun to text the way you do, you know, without enthusiasm or interest
I'm going to go around to different theatre companies this week and ask about auditions and scripts
Also I finally tried lychee in its prime and natural form
And this is one of the girls I work with. her name is Jazz and she looks like 8th grade
With her duct tape bracelets and half dyed hair (literally each hemisphere is a different color) and track pants 
Anyway, I'm glad your day went well. Que tengas un buen however you say evening
tardes!
How old is she
Sorry b I was driving
What
Live theatre workshop maybe
You need some experience or classes...
Love lychee
Hi sorry
Not like it's even that long lol
No idea how old she is
Well everyone has to start somewhere and I'm just going to see what happens with it
Even if it's just a character with no lines
And I just stand there and look hot
Like the strings player in Romeo and Juliet (hot hot hot)
Aimee I'm feeling really weird about you
But I just can't describe :(
And it makes me uncomfortable to share stuff like this now
Also I've realized that I don't like dancing at parties anymore
That makes me sad but nobody ever did it and it was always just me so I lost interest 
And you say the type of dancing I did was not the way men are supposed to do it
I feel like you don't like hanging out with me or talking to me alone and that you prefer groups.
Or that you're super uninterested in me as a person and idk.
I don't feel that way at all
I'm sorry
Why do you feel that way?
it's always different with other people around. And recently when I've tried talking to you you seem uninterested.
But I did an hour of yoga and I feel a lot better
I also finished Saturday Night and I started Taxi Driver
How are you?
You know the bookman's application had a question that asked how we feel about censorship and I totally rocked it. I used Charlie Hebdo as an example and said that reading material deemed offensive is voluntary.
I also had to talk about how I feel connected to either movies or books or games and how I could contribute to the section I work in
Fuck I didn't mean to send that
Complete accident lol
What exactly did you do on the job today?
When did you have to work with the kids? I thought keys and Martha's parent's thing were separate?
Also I'm just taking your word for how you feel. Honestly I won't be upset if you tell me the truth.
I can't believe there used to be porn theaters. Porn watching is NOT something I would feel comfortable sharing with other people. And think about how awkward it would be for both genders to be there at the same time.
So they were from SIMI, not keys and I was with them all day long
And we just went over some basic chemistry shit and pipetting and PCR
Yes I cannot imagine
Did they jerk off in the theatres
How is taxi driver
Sounds like you rocked the application
I'm sorry I think it has just been a weird week
Did you know anyone there? Make any friends?
Do you think it's worth going to every day?
Well in taxi driver he buys popcorn and a drink and sits with other men and watches.
But the movie is great so far. De Niro plays the depressed and directionless well and I love the NY city shots
Yeah I think so too! The buffalo exchange application though.... Forget it lol.
I like clothing but not to the extent that they expect from me. I know nothing about fabrics or fashion trends in different decades.
If I get it then I get it but I'll look like a fool
We all have weird weeks but let's try to make the best of this next one, yeah?
I care so much for you and I want to have a great time with whatever time we have left
Young Robert De Niro, fuccckkkkk
The accompanying jazz music is nice too
No I didn't know any of them
But I liked them overall
One girl pissed me off at the end because she spent 20 minutes asking about where she should park her car going back and forth until Martha's mom got pissed 
And I suppose so. I will go every day.
Did they ask about that stuff
Yeah
It sounds like a rad movie
They didn't ask about it but the website said it's recommended knowledge and that there's in store training during the job.
Yeah, anyway...
I'll see you later then
?
Volunteering tomorrow or no?
Yeahp
Idk ur taking too long to reply lol I'll probably be asleep next time you reply to me
So I'm just saying goodbye
Anyway, goodnight
Alright I was driving when you sent them and so I missed the notifications but alright
Goodnight
Why so late??
Hung out with jay for like an hour lol
Mostly just driving to drop off Logan's forgotten glasses case because jay was drunk and Logan wanted it ASAP
Oh ok cool
So goodnight
What's the plan tonight
Are you going to the art thing
I'd have nothing to submit tonight
Oh wait I actually wouldn't need to I think?
Anyway I'm going to SAAF at 6
For Walk in Wednesday
Right so where you gon be prior to that
Home
I'm going to the art thing the following weeks though. I can't today because it's 4-6pm
And then I guess I'll stay to volunteer every wed. after
Alright. I'll come pick you up probably around 5:30
Hope you have a good time on the farm today :)
Alright! You too :)
This guy goes to Brophy (catholic douche school in Scottsdale) and only wears sperries, and rvca and has a vineyard vines sticker on his phone
His dad also got him a 2014 Campari
Camaro
Lol the school is literally called BRO-phy. Bros and trophies (because they win)
I know some kids who go to Salpointe but they go on financial aid
He sounds gay
He isn't gay lol
Hahaha
How was your day
Mmmm have you seen the vineyard vines cases? All the ones on the website are so feminine
My day was awesome. I worked in the kitchen all day and got to dance and cook lots of fried rice
My hair always looks terrible after I take off my bandana
He talked about his gf buddy
Why don't you tie it up :O
How was your day?
Hahah that's what Jennifer does but everyone would think I'm weird
Ok a few things
I made the mistake of telling the staff that Jen and I are into acting and dancing because they had me go up and improvise some advertisement
And I guess now we are in charge of a Tucson village farm ad for the website
2. Talked to a gay Mormon
3. I have to tell you about audition stuff
He's actually not even a full Mormon. It was passed down from his dad.
Was it non-GMO fried rice
What do you dance to?
And where
Tell me all about gay mormon and the audition and AF
AD
I'll be there at 530 like I said, b
Wue
Wow
Come out?
I'm out
I saw you turn
Here
Sorry GPA was out didn't know what todo
To do
Let me know when you're about to go to sleep
Also tip: never rub your eye after sex!!!!!
they need to be teaching that in sex ed 
Hi
I am about to go to sleep
Sorry I got home and I had to do all these things
Did it burn
No no that's okay
Jay: Ahaha lol maybe we could have sex after our significant others are gone.
Elizabeth would be PISSED 
If she heard him say that
Yeah I know lol I'm just not going to reply for a while
It burned like hell
:(
Also my mom collects teabags and random shit for "composting" but she thinks one can just throw the shit onto plants and it gives the plants nutrients 
She doesn't understand that you need to turn it over
Yeah there's a method
Goodnight! I hope we talk more tomorrow
Goodnight bb!!! I had the best time ever
😘
What's up b
Hi!
I just did 45 minutes of yoga to piano ballads lol
What's up with you? How was your day?
You probably read all about my day on the FB chat haha
Also I know you hate the whole organic craze but goodness's smoothies are great, and if you don't want to go there we should go out and find other smoothie places
You know what I'm going to do tonight
You know what the fuck I'm gonna do tonight!!!!
Apparently OITNB Season 3 is out now!!!!!!
Hi
I had a pretty ok day
Daniel the lab guy got pissed off twice
I still like him though
Apparently he is gay
And 40 :O he looks 28
How much do they cost
Have you started? Is t good
Who is Daniel?
Mine was $6
Yeah it's cool
He is one of the doctors
PhD
Researcher
Oh yeah Martha tells me stories about him
Like what?!?
$6 is exorbitant
Why the ?!?
Oh just surprised 
Idk, I don't really remember. There was one about how her parents said he's super gay because he shrieked. 
I assume he is the gay person she talks about
He's really masculine lol
Like he looks like a masculine European guy
But he is a vegetarian so I guess I should have guessed
Just your type
No no it's not like that
How'd you find out he's gay?
I meant that I like learning from him
Lol that was a joke
He's pretty mean but in a constructive way
Martha was talking about him at lunch
She mentioned his partner
And I was like what
Apparently the polish city of Lodz is pronounced "Wooch"
A similar thing happened to me. I was talking to this guy who always mentions his "partner", so I assumed he was gay. I asked him what he meant by partner
And he said that she's a girl and he feels that girlfriend imposes gender roles and makes it sound like a continuous thing, making it impossible for others to believe that he could have a partner of a different sex
*"girlfriend"
But he said that he could be with a guy in the future
I still don't understand how Martha's dad's name is pronounced from the phonetics
It's like "pa-voh" but spelled totally differently 
Oh I asked and she said he was a guy. But yeah partner is really gender neutral for progressive hoes
Polish phonetics. Who knows
A continuous thing?
I was like he's gay? And she was like didn't you know?
Thanks tho I still had no idea how to say his name
At least Daniel is simple
And Monica
Yeah. He believes that if you hear someone refer to their SO as girlfriend/boyfriend then you should assume they are solely into that gender. 
Which makes no sense to me but whatever
He brings up these really profound and interesting topics and then when I answer he just nods, says "yeah" and stops talking about it as if I didn't even reply
Like he brought that up and then I was pushing for a conversation about gender roles and stuff
You can call them by their first name?
It makes me uncomfortable addressing someone's parent. I never know what to say.
OITNB is really good at making me sympathize with people who hate abortions (aka conservatives)
But then they made it trashy and turned it into a joke so I don't feel so bad anymore
She is baptizing her aborted babies' graves with Mountain Dew
They also provided a damn good argument for why abortions are right for some people
Everyone else calls them by their first name and so I do too though it made me uncomfortable
I need to start watching it...
That makes no sense at all
How does she try to impose gender roles
That's pretty dickish of him
How does who try to impose gender roles? The partner?
Have you still just been watching glee?
Yeah the partner
Yeah but not as much this week, no time.
Do you have homework?
?? I don't understand. I'm just saying that they don't use the term boy/girlfriend because it imposes gender roles.
How is monosexuality a gender role
Oh
I misread
I read it as
"He feels like his girlfriend imposes gender roles"
I skipped over your added quotations edit
No homework
Well yesterday we were supposed to read up on something but I was just walking into the room as he said it so I didn't really think he meant it to me and I didn't do it, but they didn't either and I learned it within 2 minutes when he brought it up
Lol diviya and I just facetime'd but I forgot that I tied my hair up and it was so embarrassing I had to end it
She said "wtf" after
Anyway
I understand the gender roles argument but I think that the permanent sexuality thing is a stretch 
I mean don't you think it's silly that you do it just out of habit even when your hair is so short that I couldn't possibly affect acne?
Whatever you want tho
How did you respond
Maybe she said wtf because you hung up
Everytime by Britney is so underrated
Today I did it for yoga then I undid it. I only did it again because it puts me in the zone and gets me focused. I pull it like one tightens a ponytail.
Which I needed for ACT studying
I told him I use boyfriend but that I'm willing to accommodate to whatever my partner says
Eh, she was working anyway.
God I feel like such a fag I don't understand your relationship decisions
Can you call me big papa
Or daddy
Whichever you prefer
I'll check the song out
I actually referred to you as Papa A on Instagram
Ok well goodnight
Good night!
thought u were dead
Jerkin the gherkin
K cool
Hey
Hi how are you?
Great
I learned so much today
I got home and wrote it all down
I feel very accomplished
And happy
And I'm going to ask more questions tomorrow and write it all down
And then scan it
And then save it to google drive
And one day I will have an encyclopedia of biology in my own words 
I'll be unstoppable
They are just so damn good at explaining things
Wbu?
That's great! I feel accomplished as well. Today during the parent's potluck the leader called me up and said I was being promoted to an official counselor and said a couple of nice words. Also farm yoga was a success.
I also picked some produce and made a little produce gift bag for you
I want to make you a squash boat
Aren't you sad to not be working with the SIMI kids anymore?
Still working with them
Is Reyna hanging out with Alex soon? Do I remember correctly
What does the promotion mean for you
Were you the one that mentioned squash boats to me earlier?
Like today it was me and just one of the SIMI kids
Yes to Reyna, and she actually asked me today if I wanted to come.
Yes to squash boats too
Sorry. I'm not actually sure what the promotion consists of, but I think I can get paid.
Wow that's exciting
What did you do after farm today
Have you hung out with anthony yet
I've almost accidentally sent stuff to your mom lol
I got invited to some get together on Sunday with people from Diviya's Arab thing 
After farm I hung out with Jennifer for a while. We both got hired to babysit the children for one of the staff members, which is super exciting because they live in these little communities and one of our friends lives there
Then we picked and bagged some produce to take home. 
And I once I got home I took a nap
Now I'm not really doing much. Just ate. Wbu? What's up
No because I never respond to his messages lol, which is terrible.
What are those shoelaces ugh
A joke
That's what they are
Aw thanks b
The staff member would have been babysitting them?
I was taking notes, then I worked on coding a bit. Now I am about to watch glee.
What did you eat
It's kinda sad because at first I wanted the laces but then I came to despise them because of my lack of money. The ugh signifies discomfort in a state of poverty. You would have been able to tell if you had received a 5 on AP lit.
Oh I meant that the staff member has a child (who also volunteers) and Jen and I are friends with the child
So we are going to babysit the child.
I'll document what it is like inside of a hippie commune home
There are four houses that connect to each other and apparently all four families eat dinner together every night
I've been eating a bowl of salad and drinking tea every night. About 3 cups a day!
at the farm there was Jamaica prickly pear tea and then cucumber ginger lemon water
I really miss it :(
Also homemade horchata and lassi (absolutely terrible please never try it unless you are into abuse and torture... I mean I know you are but not this kind)
The owners of twisted tandoor came and made it for us
Yeah you're welcome, hottie
So maybe two nights ago I started watching Annie Hall and I find Woody Allen so fucking annoying
Look at the menu. We NEED to go there. It's our priority place now, unless you suggest otherwise.
My ass has taken such a pounding the past few weeks. I feel like I am basically on a colon cleanse.
"Poverty"
Were the drinks good
I am making Tunisian fish soup 
I have made horchata, it rocked 
Also it caused diabetes
Why was the lassi so bad
What have you eaten that led to that problem
I know a lot about colons 
The spices used for the drink didn't complement it and it is literally Greek yogurt mixed with water. Every other drink was sooo good though. This guy who works at Trader Joes knew all the recipes.
I will probably make that this week. I have been looking for something good to eat using fish.
What's in it?
Today Jen and I made cheese that tasted like nothing because nobody added any salt!!!!
Lol drinking and all, diabetes from horchata is the least of my concerns
But I've been drinking cleansing and diet teas sooooo
"I know a lot about colons"
Bitch you've been working in a lab for less than a week
I researched today
I love trader joes
I'm gonna be one of those people who only shops there
Nothing really interesting:
I had always wanted to make cheese
Yess I also decided that I will shop there as well. Even farmer's markets or Market on the Move. I also want my own garden and chickens. 
Oh yeah I found that link already
That's the recipe I'm going to use
I want to live a very local lifestyle where I'm involved in the community and shit like that. 
I want to have a party where I ask people to bring ingredients and I'll set up different stations and people can make cheese or wine in one area and work on drinks in another 
People can come over and maybe harvest some fruits and vegetables and get the chicken eggs 
I also want time to work on my art and I want a little studio where I can hire people to pose for me
When everyone is at my house they'll say "wow, you must've paid thousands for this" and I'll say "haha nah bitch I did it myself"
Jay's yoga room is so cool too. I want one of those so I can have my daily yoga sex sessions.
Describe to me your dream life/home
I'm getting too into this right now
The stay at home lifestyle is pretty appealing too. I would wake up and start with a copy of the New Yorker and yoga or maybe a 3 mile run or sabino canyon. decide what I want to make for dinner from my various ethnic cookbooks. breakfast made and heated in the oven so my husband can eat while I'm out.
I would also love getting high some nights and just relaxing by my pool in the nude
That would be a fun party
Do you think this is like your church camp phase
Where you will tone it down a lot in a couple weeks or no
My dream life hmm
Epidemiologist for CDC, work 6 months of the year in cool places
Spend the rest of the year chillin with my homies
Mansion in nature, super modern, walls of windows
Oregon or some shit
Forest
Gardens 
Lake
Or river 
Music room 
With tons of jazz LPs
Portland food
Canoeing at dawn
You know
Your dream lifestyle is a lot more achievable
And that's great
You could do all that on a middle class income
... Not so much. Would need to make like 400K minimum
The house would be made of wood
I think I'm done with 🌿. For real
Don't like it that much
And I don't want to have the thought in the back of my mind that it is hurting my brain
No more
I love being sober 
I love learning 
I love life
Why harm the time I spend sober
By using 🌿
I'll stick to 🍸in the future. It has bad effects but not on brain as much 
Not that I'm sure 🌿 is bad, very limited studies, but don't want to risk
I've always thought of the Ex Machina house as my dream house but I've come to realize that I enjoy the simple life a lot more and that I want to be in a vibrant city, not secluded. Maybe secluded for my vacations.
Ex Machina house for the fall or winter 
Actually me too. At least the exterior. I can't believe I didn't think of that comparison
I feel the same way about doing things in front of people. I've never smoked since prom night and I'm not going to. I'll try shrooms and that's it.
I think in the future I'll stick to wine
Ex Machina house minus glass windows and drab futuristic interior 
I'm looking forward to having so much time to read. I want a library
Actually I knew you would say that this might be a phase, but it is what I have wanted for a long time now and I think that if it makes me happy now then it could make me happy later.
As long as I have friends and security then I'm okay
My dream is comfort
And happiness 😊😊😊
I think I'm a relatively happy person based on my emoji selections. The knife was from last night when we were pretending to be depressed.
I want to watercolor
We could do a watercolor date
!!!!!!!!!!!
You have no idea how happy I am to hear you say that
I love you
:)
We can sit in a park or on some hill and paint the city
Or the mountains
Or each other :O
Sunset and mountains? I have limited skill. A portrait would be like a blob
But yeah that sounds great
I think I have a bunch of brushes, but if I don't then I'll get some this week
I've got the supplies covered, don't worry
We can also have a picnic while we're there
Lol well what you can do is light sketching prior to using the paint 
And then it's basically painting in the lines. The problem is making sure the paint doesn't flow and maintaining/creating color
You'll teach me
Because I'm very shit at art
Omg I remember when Shawn and I broke up I painted this piece very clearly about him, referencing his ethnicity and our dates. It was basically a timeline progression of our relationship in a painting.
It appeared in the art show and he went by every piece except mine
The title was "X-Mas Presents: Japanese Summer Fruit" lol
It was monochromatic (red) and followed the golden spiral precisely
I recall
It
Do you have it still 
How do you know about it????
Did I ever show you??
Yeah I'm gonna look for it
You know
You should wear the mid thigh shorts and sperries
You got dem legs
And yes
I found it... It is atrocious. There's a line that says "Obsession and stories of heartbreak"
I remember I thought
It was kinda shitty looking but
I kept that to myself
Where had you kept it
I only got good at art once I started doing better in school
It was odd. Like every class skill set improved
It was in some box I still haven't unpacked from the move lol
That's really nice of you to say
I also like rolling up pants to the mid calf
I would wear those shorts but I don't know what shirt to wear with them
ACT tomorrow!
Don't matter people will be blinded by leg
Good luck
Go to sleep OMG
Lol I physically can not go to sleep earlier than 11
Especially since I napped today
I was up kinda late on SAT night
Omg don't even get me started on APs. Like 1 am APUSH night.
Time management is the only problem but I got a nearly perfect score on my practice exam
When working on my own time
The only thing that worries me anymore is the essay writing
Well
I mean
I feel like because I'm not in school anymore my writing is shitty
The ACT is literally all about time
Everyone knows that
I feel the same way
I feel like sometimes I want a word and I don't know the word. Happens to me every summer. 
Did you see the article about Joseph
“Joseph is an exemplary student and he excels in all curricular subjects at BASIS Tucson North,” notes BASIS Tucson North Director of Student Affairs Michelle Wohlford. “It is not surprising that he achieved a perfect score on the ACT given his track record at our school. We expect great things from him in the future.”
Where was Diviya's 2400 recognition
It's because he's white. We all know it.
Really though, I am proud of Joseph's achievements but my problem is that I think that a perfect ACT score shows nothing of his character
And that's what I'm more concerned with and what I think the world should focus more on
Rather than admissions and test scores that could be based off an intrinsic knowledge
"Rather than admissions and test scores that could be based off an intrinsic knowledge" what
Does this mean
What is an intrinsic knowledge
Like you
It's exactly you
You don't even fucking study for these exams
You are literally the epitome of intrinsic knowledge
Let me let you in on something I realized today
I don't have intrinsic knowledge
I'm just really curious
And I look a lot of shit up
About like everything
that's how I know things
Now that's the knowledge bit. The test-taking ability I can't explain through my actions
No no no, I mean for the logic tests
Yes, exactly
Neither can I
But my theory at the moment
But I'm sure somebody can
Is that I studied less and less through middle school
Became more and more dependent on deductive reasoning and test-taking ability
Honed that school through high school by not studying 
And bam
Perhaps. I definitely think that doing well on these exams is something that can be improved and that whether or not you did well in middle school there's a way around the system. 
Your theory would explain deducing meanings of words through prefixes and most of the math
I'm fast
Good at skimming for answers
I know the greek and Latin for the prefixes
So that's probably where the reading comes in
#BasisAdvantage
I never took a Latin class in my life
I learned the prefixes this year
Who knew bell- meant war
It always sounded so pretty to me
That's because SPANISH
Not meant to be caps
So I think I'm actually going to sleep soon
Idk what time I need to be at the test center lol
I remember I knew what odious and amicable meant using Spanish 
GREGARUOUS
*gregarious
Alright, good night. 
Mmmmmhm
Mmmmmhm

💖🐸💁 
the emojis that remind me of you
plus turtle
🍆🌿😘🌚 you
Look up Ela Barton- Arizona. What a bitch. So unnecessary and untrue. Slam poetry could be cool if it wasn't so social justice bitchy 99% of the time
Fuck I can't sleep I just jerked of
Off
Also wow I can't believe 🌿 I rarely ever talk about it
Sip
Sup*
How did it go
Do you find that attractive
I tried listening to Ela Barton (who is apparently a he) last night but I couldn't concentrate, so I'll try again soon.
According to her website she is a she?
The ACT was okay. I knew everything would be fine except for the writing and that is exactly what happened.
Where did you see that?
How did writing go
Do you think it's acceptable for me to flirt with other people?
I find it modestly attractive, but I thought you would like it lol
No not intentionally
It was in the bio of the YouTube video I watched
Well I mean my points were clear but I didn't flesh them out. The example essay in the prep book was 2.5 pages long and mine was 1.5...
The prompt was whether or not a "universal healthy food rating system" should be implemented
I would have found it more attractive if my mom wasn't next to me when I opened it
Ok that's what I think too but Diviya says flirting is something she can't help
And she's told Nate that lol
What have you done today?
Brook in OITNB is so hot
Did she see it
Sorry
You know I never took ACT with writing
You know
Diviya is like me to the extreme but it is socially acceptable because she is female and her partner is male
I watched the first episode of OITNB
some coding 
Some glee 
I like brook's hair
Wbu? What does your day look like
Someone told me that unless you take the ACT with writing then it doesn't matter to colleges 
Depends on the college but
I think we can all say we are basically the same person as Diviya but for this instance I don't agree at all
Most require that if send in only the ACT it has to be with writing 
But I sent in both and Ms. Fulford said they would consider my ACT
I mean with regards to relationship brashness
Like she does a lot of insensitive things to Nate that we overlook, and that y'all would kill me for if I did to that extent.
At least she is still very loving
#strictlybusiness
Well it's expected from her with her social justice stances 
That's not a decent reason lol but ok
You gonna go to 2nd sat?
I'm making cottage cheese
Did you know my family keeps bread in the freezer
That looks awesome. Do you want me to give you money to pay or vice versa?
Also the place I talked about yesterday is a food truck called twisted tandoor
I am but I think Martha and I are eating before or something
I basically made cottage cheese minus the cream
Cottage cheese and peaches or blueberries is the best
My mom does that too lol
She puts anything in the freezer and then takes it out months later and says it's not spoiled
Too much, too much
I feel like it's only okay to say the first part in person 
Diviya sends me way too much
She has basically turned into how I used to be
How is your cottage cheese turning out? Pic?
It is fucking awesome
Done
Where does the food truck go
Idk about the groupon. Will get back to you
Yeah that's a bit too intimate to share
In pic form
Yes peaches! 
I usually don't eat it sweet tho
Just on toast
That looks so good. You're just eating it plain?
The food truck goes all over Tucson. Every day they post their location and menu on their Facebook page.
Omg look up ruby rose
Lol Diviya so dumb for being so smart
No I had it on toast
And it was awesome
Like 50x better than regular cottage cheese
Also probably like double the fat
But oh so worth it
Yeah I've known about ruby for almost a year now after that short film. So sexy.
So sexy 
Brook looks like 14...
Oitnb is filmed in an abandoned kids psychiatric ward :O
Hey sorry
It was funny because this guy I know who works at trader joes said that people go in there all the time and assume everything is healthy because it's from trader joes but they know nothing about portions
I had a childhood friend whose house used to be a retirement home. There were ramps inside for wheelchairs and stuff
The prison interior always seemed pretty small to me
Brook looks... hot
Her naïveté is sexy
If your dick could talk what would it be saying
"Only if you've been tested"
What does that mean
Oh wait
Never mind I get it
What up
Well just went to spark root, eating at food for ascension, and then party later
Or like some drinking get together
Can I come? This is lame
Mm well Diviya and I are going to some Arab friends house
 Oh right
Sorry I though it was an us people thing
Well Reyna is coming too
But they ate with us
Jay got Elizabeth high so they can't come
You can come if you want I guess
Oh ok
Where
Ok well
?
?
What's wrong
My phone keeps dying
Over and over
And then coming back on
What's the plan
Where you at
B
I need you 
I want you
Diviya and I are with some kids now. One goes to tufts lol. 
<3
Fuck I love tufts
You want to meet us at university
1750 east 10th street apt 1
Shit I would have met you
But the notification came in when I was on the phone w police
Oh well
I'll be there 
Can you take Diviya and me home? 
When
Maybe 11
Ok
What's up
U r beautiful
U r too
2*
🌺🌺🌺
Goodnight beebzzy 
Goodnight bisbee
In my dream Hector took a snapchat video of Larissa working out naked and she had a man chest 
Bisbee Pride June 19-21!
I actually reaally want to go
Fuck yeah! I'm scheduled for a phone interview with bookmans.
Omfg I can just imagine Larissa with man boobs and chest hair and puffy nipples
It's strange to me because
I can turn it on or off and I know when I am doing a gay or straight voice
How about we go the 20th?
Congrats!!!!
She had puffy nipples that didn't fit the size of her pec. It was all so weird. Hector was in the vent lol.
I knew you could tell when you're doing it!!! You liar
Unfortunately I can not switch and I have tried, trust me
Also though it doesn't matter to me
Why does it matter to you so much?
I think that if people can't like you for the way you normally talk then fuck them. I'm not going to change my voice to feel more accepted.
Well I could do it in the first place as switching from girl to guy voice, basically natural vs forced voice
Yeah!!! That'll be awesome. Maybe we can invite some other gays or something
And I just maintained that ability. It's nice I guess but I wouldn't care so much if I sounded gay all the time
Or Diviya lol
Well sometimes I just switch and don't notice 
If I think about it I would know
But I usually don't
It just happens depending on context
Okay but what's so different about talking in gay voice around me and girl friends vs. being around the guys? It's also not just the voice change but also filler words like dude and man
What do you feel more comfortable with
Codeswitching
Omg all the Jew references in 5 to 7. Especially that baseball one hahahah.
Look it up
How far are you into the season
Hahaha Jay's snap jay
*snapchat
I meant 5 to 7 the movie, but I'm halfway through episode 6.
It's funny how people say they hate flirting/cheating while in relationships and then do it anyway
No I know you meant 5-7
5 to 7 *
Who are you referring to
Sure, but why do you feel the need to express yourself differently according to the gender you are conversing with 
A universal conversation is sex
Even without having done it there is plenty to talk about
I'm referring to many things in general. We see it in movies and tv shows and even in real life.
Basically piper is like "ya Alex we dating now, if anyone flirt with you I'm gonna pop a bitch" and then Ruby Rose comes along
I feel like you think I've actually cheated on you
Do not ruin shit for me Ho
Dunno it's subconscious. Maybe it lets me connect better
Nah, though I don't think you prevent people from coming onto you promptly and strongly as I would have liked pretty often
You literally ruined shit for me yesterday by telling me to look up ruby (originally only knew the face). Then I saw all these "ruby has the hots for piper in OITNB" posts, bitch.
Well I think I can connect to people regardless, especially with sensitive guys like Jay.
I don't let my voice hinder any relationships 
You and Caleb both send me shit about this ruby bitch
Except ours :(
You sent it first...
Ok I just think it changes things and you don't realize it
Like you get the sensitive side of jay
And I don't
And I also don't get the sensitive side of jay because we talk about other things like privilege and race relations and other issues 
It's both sides and that satisfies me
And I'm ok to happy with that
That's great that you get what you want but how I am gets me what I want
I like how my relationships are with the straight boys
The hate sex was really nice on OITNB
You know I normally hate watching woman on woman. It's disgusting to me. But piper and Alex are the exception
Hey what's up
I actually wish I had more alone time with some of the straight boys I'm friends with, like Nate and Jay
I used to watch lesbian makeouts on YouTube because I thought it would make me straight
But like the Japanese school girls shit
Alex takes charge like nobody else
Did it work
Jk
When did you want to be straight
I am in the bath
Oh cool
Well the pastor meetings made me wish I was because I felt like being gay was just something that would make people dislike me
I always knew I liked guys and from 6th-8th grade I wanted people to think I was straight
I also tried convincing myself that I was
I thought that I would never have a relationship with a guy because I had never met a person who openly came out to me as gay
I felt like being straight was the only way to find love or any partnership until Anthony came along
When the opportunity came up I ditched Maria 
That's really sad
Did you watch those it gets better videos in that period? If so what did you think of them
Also, I just realized why texts are brilliant
Like yesterday, how that guy rambled, that wouldn't happen over text
You make a point, I respond and elaborate, then you do the same. Texting means that you are expected to respond before I begin speaking again. Also, it is supposed to stay relatively brief so you don't ramble and bore the other person
I started watching those videos in 7th and 8th grade and i promised myself that one day I would move to NYC or SF where the gays hang out so I could find a partner. They were a source of hope for me. Now I understand the deeper message but I wasn't aware of child abuse, etc.
It pisses me off having conversations with people who ramble because I eventually lose the point of the conversation and I'm not sure which part of what he's saying is relevant
With texts I can read and reread messages and ponder your message and then formulate my response
My only problem with texting is full articulation and the lack of emotion 
Also the instantaneous storytelling instead of making it more dramatic or humorous in person
I have no idea how I was able to speak clearly last night 
It was more clear than when I am sober
I guess it was because I didn't feel timid around you drunk
I can't fathom how you still feel timid around me
Lol I remember the NYC obsession
It's not really timid but that I don't want to tell you things that could hurt you
And when I do I feel terrible
What's ur plan
Like what's up
Dunno
Debating going to saskia's things
It's not a party party
And it is with the same people as yesterday
Wbu
That sounds eh hahah
I'm leading people in yoga at this Arab picnic lol
Oh how long does that go
Ends at 8!
Maybe you can pick us up and we can swim at Diviya's or something
YASSSS
I'm gonna make soup
I'll bring you soup
Hahah well we can eat it at Diviya's 
4060 E River Rd Tucson, AZ, United States
Donde Ezra's
Estas 
What's up
Ok 
Should I come now
We thought you were on your way!!!
Look it's my friend Sara!
Oh! Ok I'm on my way now then
And Diviya 
Y'all are beautimous
And Sergio's v-neck
That too
What ever happened to your soup!
You know, another example of being sexy was kissing the box but that was ultimately a failure
I thought that by telling people I was imagining it was you then you'd be turned on
Serious about the soup though bae 
Maybe we can invite Reyna to pride
That would be super fun
I didn't finish it before I went to pick you up
I thought it would be at 8
Hahahahha hahahahahahahs
That's so funny
Omg
Sweet goal, but drunk logic 
Aimee I'm kinda drunk right now but like you actually make me happy
And I feel like you where I can't express the amount
Of happiness I feel for you
Not only am I glad we're committed but like your presence and conversations  and your being just excites me
:)
I don't really want a response unless you feel like it hah because I know u
But I reaaaaaaaally want you to know
That's what I was just thinking
Because I never want to hurt you intentionally
Just feel loved 😘
Don't speak
But il Lysol to Reyna
*ill talk to Reyna
And maybe we can all pitch in gas money
Alright 
😍
Let's talk tomorrow
Gotta get dat sleep
awesome!!!
Hahahah
Gotta get get get dat sleep sleep sleep
Goodnight!
Goodnight my prince 
Kind of want to see Jurassic world...
I saw sweeneys post and now I feel like I should too
Also sorry, I accidentally left my phone at home and I just got back
According to NPR Sunday is national yoga day
Also omg the NAACP Spokane president
Consider white people who grow up in a predominantly black community; are they black?
Let's talk about that next time we see each other
I'm actually seeing Jurassic today 
Fuck my cousins are sooooo hot
And they drive camaros 
Hi
What's up
Which cousins
I don't think that's much of a discussion. Jennifer isn't white. But ok
Just got home. Wbu
The ones I sent the pic of, only now they're older 
Ok well NPR made it a discussion, gosh
The thing is that why does a drop of ethnic blood suddenly make you distinguishable as completely ethnic
Does not personal identity play a role in your race
I don't know where to draw the line but "Consider white people who grow up in a predominantly black community; are they black?" Is a clear and absolute "no" to me 
I just got home too
What did you do all day
Today my PCR was the only one that worked so I'm proud of that
My brother called the police because he didn't want to go to scouts and so both grandpa and mom called the police that he wouldn't listen
What about internal race where jay doesn't feel Indian and I don't feel xican inside
Went out for breakfast this morning, hung out with my cousins and watched unbreakable kimmy schmidt, and then went out to see Jurassic World
I had to come home and deal with this bullshit
Call me stupid but I don't know what PCR is. You all mention it nonstop but never explain it to me.
Did the police come
You know
To me race means skin color and ancestry
To me it doesn't matter if Jay doesn't feel Indian. Because all "Indian" means to me is that he has genetic indian origin. 
To be fair someone could say
"To me it doesn't matter if Aimee doesn't feel female. Because all "female" means to me is that she is genetically female"
But I really think more goes along with being female than does with being of some eve
Race
Anyone of any race can be anything, it means nothing other than ancestry. Female means having some bodily characteristics of which I am not a fan of and do not desire and have changed. 
I'm sorry b :(
Is it normal for you to hang with your cousins
PCR = polymerase chain reaction. Basically artificial DNA replication 
Are you busy
Ummm is 8:30 or 9 or 9:30 okay?
Which works for your
Reyna and I are going out for coffee. She's picking me up from scouts I think
Can I come or no?
Lol yes I'm asking you what time works for you
Oh, 8:45?
Would you be able to pick me up at 8:30
From scouts
Ya ok
Sure
Maybe 5 extra minutes, thanks a bunch boo
Come out boo
Y'all laughin up a storm
"I compared Osama Bin Laden to Ronald Reagan in their indifference to the destruction each of them brought to the city I lived in." - Jay Z, Decoded 
Also I'm sorry. I was really inconsiderate of your presence and I wish you had told me sooner. I don't want you to feel like that and I'm going to be more aware next time.
You could've said bye or something
Hmph 
Sorry I thought I said bye. It's ok
Eh Ronald Reagan is less responsible than Ed Koch
Also I'm sorry. I was really inconsiderate of your presence and I wish you had told me sooner. I don't want you to feel like that and I'm going to be more aware
 next time.
I love how the literary references made in Fun House are explained 
*home
Reyna and I agree you are such a nerd
What could one intelligent person possibly discuss with an unintelligent person in their relationship?!
How am I a nerd
How far are you into the book
What are you doing today
Is Keizer getting grey hair 
How are we supposed to know who Ed Koch is haha
I'm on page 83 or something. Early 80s.
It's actually super cute
So Reyna and I went to bookmans and picked out books and had a reading date. Then we went to cartel and continued reading and we have been talking for hours 
We also took a trip to lucky wishbone (my first time!!!) to get some chicken strips and bread and fries hahah.
KZ is actually super self conscious about that :( but it certainly does look like he is lol
Sounds like you had a great day!
Did you like lucky wishbone
Poor guy
It's dense for a graphic novel
I did have a great day. Nearly spent the whole day together until I left at 3:15. 
How was your day? How are you feeling?
Suuuuper dense. Sure she defines some of the concepts but there various references I don't understand or find confusing to interpret 
Nevertheless, I only have 100 pages left and I think it's an explicitly precise representation of gender and sexuality identity.
What is your opinion on the book? Some of the dad graphics and stories turn me on.
What's up
Bass lesson one sec
Oh no. I just thought you were still upset with me.
I really loved it
And I liked the drawings of the photos of the younger guy he was with, with curly hair
My day was great
I love my mentor
She is so great 
Reyna left her phone here
I know. Her mom called me so I texted her and asked what she wants to do about it.
Any plans made?
I tell you when she's on her way and then you just go out and give it to her.
It's strange to me that I get from you what I want
Say you or I didn't respond or give a terse response then I can expect the same back
Or like basically we can choose to continue a conversation or just not address certain things
Ok anyway
Curly haired Roy was cute
I am confused as to what you mean
Nvm
Diviya and I are planning out a bday camping party the 11th
Of course Diviya wants the Jeffrey's
Good god I hope she is joking
Here is her list: Sergio, Diviya, Nate, Martha, Aimee, Reyna, Madeleine, Jen, Elliot, Hannah, Jeffrey's, Trenton, Shayda, Josh, Nina, Ivan
No Joseph?
Or Jay?
Both out of town
Right
Where is jay going again?
And "Jeffrey's" is incorrect grammar, that's a possessive. How did she get an 800? Jk :)
Shawn, Demi, and Ale too
What
I feel like this is a wormhole to last year's fight. Or your are joking 
I think you are joking
Jay is going to Atlanta
Honestly I want Shawn to go
?
??
!?!!!
Well if Demi and I could make amends then why can't him and I
Man you and Reza
Have the incessant desire to make amends
He has already graduated high school, moved on. You should too. No need to rekindle a dead fire with a shitty guy
Especially why invite him to a thing like this
All your close friends and Shawn? Reyna doesn't like him, I don't like him. Ask him to lunch or something.
Sorry that was pretty mean
Eh, you're probably right I guess.
Used to that by now
Jk. That was bitchy but not really.
Honestly I was just channelling my deep desire to not camp with all our friends + Shawn 
Reyna and I both agreed it was bitchy for you to say "I love you Reyna" and then not even say bye to me
Sorry it was super unintentional
But then we ended up having this half hour conversation about you
I think I said bye to you both but I meant it to you
What conclusions did you reach
And your whole thing about I love you and how it's easier to say it to friends and stuff
You don't say it to me even in a friendly way because you don't want me to assume you mean it more than the way it was intended
But it's easier for you to say it to her
And at this point I don't really care
I feel like if you were going to say anything at all then you would've said it earlier 
Oh haha we also talked about your nerdiness and how your walls make it difficult to connect. We think your ideal partner will be one who isn't very emotional or romantic 
But competitive like you
If I was with someone else as competitive as I am we would kill each other
I don't think I have walls, btw. I think I just don't proffer personal things without prompting
I have definitely had friends I was super open with about absolutely everything
(Alex)
Ok but he's an asshole and I feel like he is the wrong person to open up to
He wasn't an asshole to me, for a long time
He respected me
Then what's so different about your friends now?
He's an asshole cos he thinks he is better than everyone
Dunno
Do you think I respect you?
I'm just in a less vulnerable and emotional part of my life
But the truce is fragile and I would rather not disrupt it
Yes.
Well, m
Mostly 
I think you tell yourself you will always respect me and that's easy to do when I'm unemotional and not in conflict with any of your own interests
But I think you try very hard to make me happy
I don't have a problem with your minor indiscretions at all
It happens
Last night, the Zayna BS, no big deal.
So then if those are minor indiscretions what are things I do that show a lack of respect?
Repetition thereof 
A là the Sara incident
Or how last night was close to a repeat of the night at Diviya's when I was asleep
You say you feel shitty about doing it to me but it repeats
But it isn't a big deal
Last night you told me to put on a condom and you let me have sex with you and then you told me it was awesome.....
And I don't think you do it out of disrespect
Like last night you didn't tell me not to
Not the sex
In the morning, around 6
I tried doing it in the morning?
Yeah
Rubbing your boner on me
Ok I actually wasn't trying to go in this morning but ok
No I know
But you woke me up at least twice I think
And I love when you do what you did 
But not right then and I thought I made that clear
That I needed my sleep
I mean I know that I went in when it was okay (?) but I moved myself from the bed because I was upset with myself for constantly bothering you
And that is kinda why I ignored you this morning
I was so upset because I thought you were annoyed with me
Also what did you do with the condom?
Toilet
Gr8
I'm sorry you became so upset with yourself
And I was a bit annoyed but I was completely over it by the morning
But I knew that's why you ignored me
But I wasn't sure if you were perhaps mad at me?
It's so strange to me because I am a heavy sleeper and you could probably do the same to me and I wouldn't wake up
Like jerk me off in my sleep
Or sit on my erect dick
Cum. Come. Sorry.
Sorry for making it sexual. Ooooooooooh!
Well I got mad after you left but Reyna has me talk things out and feel better
I need to take charge of my sexuality
I'm serious about that
I was considering making a poster or something so that I can remember that daily
Well it's sad for me to see your needs go unanswered. 
And I don't want you to be unsatisfied secually 
Secually
Sexually
And so I think it is acceptable for you to sometimes push things
But not like this morning. 
And not like when you got drunk and kept telling me you needed to tell me a secret lol
No but the point of taking control of myself is that I won't push you anymore. It isn't a need, it's more that every time I'm in the mood I feel like I can just do what I want.
Which is not okay
It is pointless to share my beliefs on sex (like doing it when you drop me off, etc.) if I won't take charge and show it's what I actually believe 
I want to be more passive about sexual encounters and stop being so hyperactive.
I need to feel wanted and discover sex from the other side too.
I need to stop sharing sex with people who aren't part of it because it is my sex and my body and your body.
And I need to respect my body
And most importantly, yours.
I am sorry :(
What makes me feel sexually dissatisfied is myself
You know, that's a lot more introspective than I have ever been about sex
So I commend you
Even if you don't follow through in the near future, good on you for understanding what is up
And I agree with you that my ability to express desire for you is a bit smothered by your "hyperactivity" 
When people are telling me that i am the most sexual person they know and that I have a distinct passion for sex how can I not be introspective about this???
It's bothers me for so long 
*bothersd
I want your help with this though
I at least want to follow through with it until you leave
With casual stuff I won't really care because it won't be as continuous. The discussing part is something I want to stand by
Yeah I need to slow it down
Have you read this week's Amherst controversy?
Oh yes totally! A hell of a controversy.
No, please explain.
It's somewhat expected but ironic to me given how much they touted their emphasis on preventing and punishing  sexual harassment 
It's because a couple years ago they were in the news for the opposite, not taking these things seriously enough
Many admitted  kids and parents when I was there expressed concerns regarding sexual harassment at amherst
In fact my friend at ATC wrote her big play about how their administration ignored reports of sexual assault
Discussing what?
Oh wait nvm
I mean of course you would be introspective but it is great that you have quickly come to such sincere conclusions
How can I help you
Ok so I'll send you an article about it
It's such a mess
All over the news and Internet
What the fuck
How does she withdraw consent? It just seems so clear to me who is guilty here
And if this is such a huge scandal then why doesn't the school do anything about it
Especially since media outlets are covering it and there is evidence 
What fuck ups
They don't know what to do
They want to be tough on people who harass 
I mean they may let this guy back in but
They need to figure out a policy shift
That respect the interests of both the victim and the defendant
I know right
Still love em tho
Respect the interests of both the victim and the defendant
Omgggggg
?
I really think in cases of sexual assault the defendant's 'interests' shouldn't matter too much
But then things like this happen
You can't presume guilt. You can't bypass a fair trial of the evidence
And sometimes, the fact is, there is a lack of evidence, and that MUST mean a not guilty verdict. That is how we stop innocent people from being punished, which is to me a greater injustice than not punishing the guilty.
I'm reading this paper about microbes that live on and in animals and it is crazy
You can take a genetically obese mouse (mouse has a genetic hormone imbalance which leads it to always be hungry), and take its poop and put its microbes in a normal mouse and the normal mouse will get obese. 
Never did I think I would see this headline 
?
Active 28m ago boy where you at
Hey sorry I fell asleep early
I didn't think you could text while you are working so I didn't respond, idk
Also you are the king of not addressing things I said the night before
I think Miley is doing a great thing though. Her Instagram posts show her millions of fans that these "trends" or "phases" are not that, but real things that real people experience
I've come around to genderfluidity
The key to making our enemies obese
Maybe that is what the Chinese and xicans know that we don't
But we do now
You've always wondered what ghetto people talk about; here is a girl from the job program I didn't do:
Oh I am on lunch
Sorry
I like Miley's efforts too
How do you feel about gender fluidity 
Lol @ the obesity but meMexico is as obese as us
Maybe to try to disguise their intentions
What a wonderful conversation 
I'm meeting Arabic program kids for lunch soon
I no longer define gender as two strict gender identities and I totally support the use and announcement of different pronouns.
It all makes sense to me and it is this feeling.
She started this beautiful movement called InstaPride and tells the stories of different LGBTQ folk every day, as well as raising awareness about LGBTQ homelessness.
That was the most awkward lunch I have ever been to.
How did it go
Do you relate to it?
Yeah I heard about instapride
NO I AM NOT
I LIKE 🍆
Well it was me, an American University girl who talked to me about her LGBTQA club (...), a quiet Air Force girl, the guy Diviya cheated with, tufts kid, and Sara
Oh and Diviya
In a way I do relate to it because I've always hated having to live up to male expectations and just being a male in general 
There are so many circumstances where I feel like a female and it's not consistent
It has always just felt like I have to either be a female or a male but gender is so much more than that.
Do you still want to get a gift for your dad?
I think I am going to get him something tractor related
He likes tractors
And the cavaliers
Maybe a tractor with cavalier colors and logo
🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
Did she flirt with him
Is she a gay
The american university bish
Gender Expectations and gender roles != gender identity
Like at least from my standpoint there isn't a comparison to be drawn between those concepts
John Deere has great tractors. You can buy one and just paint on the Cavalier colors and logo.
Lots of flirty eye contact and on the way back to the UA he was looking for a girl to sit on his lap and Diviya didn't know what to do
No, she is an ally.
I was telling her my church camp story and she interrupted the moment I said church camp and said "I'm an atheist" 
Explain gender expectations?
That's just a bit out of my price range. Unless you mean they have great toy ones.
What do you mean he was looking for a girl to sit on his lap
Is he hot
That's not very nice of her, hmph.
Real tractors can't be that expensive, c'mon. Father's Day 2015 only happens once in his lifetime.
There wasn't enough space in the car so they had to sit each other's laps, but I walked away before I saw who was sitting with who
He is hot but still no excuse
We laugh and make fun of those people who have "stupid" conversations but it's nice in a way because the conversations are lighthearted 
Fuck. 1800's and Africa just sounds like the biggest adventure ever.
Yes it's endearing and reminds you that shit ain't so serious
You're right. I asked him what he would do with a tractor and he said dig up stuff, and trees. And then cover things. Lol.
Are you gonna get gpa something
I adore adventure/travel stories like Jules Verne, and even more so when they are real. How did he cross the ocean?
Yes, Aimee. Shit ain't so serious.
Hahaha he can finally do some radical stuff with that plot you guys have next to the backyard 
And look very dashing while doing so with his colorful tractor  
Gender expectations basically mean gender roles btw 
Yeah, I have to. I'm thinking maybe tomorrow. My family (minus him) is actually going to be out for the night because they are going to the circus. 
My mom wants me to go somewhere and stay the night lol.
Fuck I think I'm gonna look for someone doing local nipple piercings under the table so I won't need an adult with me
I'm counting on you craigslist
Tomorrow night?
Lol are you serious 
That's such a bad idea 
What if they aren't sterile
And it gets infected 
And it falls off like mine
My aunt just came in today randomly
She bought the ticket yesterday lol
Yes, because she thinks it is weird when I am home alone with my grandpa.
Of course I am not serious damn it. You really assume the worst ghetto xican in me, don't you?
"Well.. He had a shitty upbringing.."
"He's getting better" lol like I suffered some severe medical injury - an upbringing from a pair of uneducated xicans.
I am going to wait until I turn 18 to see if I want the piercing. 
That is what I have decided.
The circus is everything but an extravaganza to me. I hate it when things try to force the spectacular and intense onto me. I would rather experience it on my own without those extreme expectations, because I get bored and get pissed off over the false advertising.
What's up
I'm at the family friend's house
That's a good choice
How was your day
I like the Jean shot
Ramadan buddy 
I looked so good today with my jean shorts and my boots. Reyna and I have decided to clean out our closets and only keep the flattering things. It's also an act of discovering what flatters you.
Cleaning out your closet, that is
Well, I finished the book. Watched lots of OITNB. Went out for lunch. Grocery shopping.
Wbu? How was your day?
We are actually going to have a clothing exchange. Maybe we can do that tomorrow!! First we bring what we don't want and exchange it with each other, then we bag the leftover clothes and donate them to Buffalo and Plato's and get $$$
We can come over after work?
I think we should totally go to Mady's housewarming party
When is that? 
How far are you into OITNB?
Come over where? My aunt is over 
Plus I don't really have clothes to give away I think
But I'll check
My day rocked
Learned a lot
About how gut bacteria are studied 
You know, I work with fecal DNA?
Nevermind I got the invite
Party this Friday. Mady pretty much invited every single person who has ever  attended basis.
Episode 10
So basically you can't have people over while your aunt is there?
I guess as long as you are not dealing with the actual physical substance then that is fine hahah
Must be strange to think about though
Nicely subtle shot.
*nice,
Not really, no. She is very needy
No we do
I mean I don't touch it, the forceps do
Thx b
My mentor from the lab used to work at cartel
What's up with Reyna's phone?
Idk Reyna and I are gonna be together tomorrow but we can drop by during your break
Alright. I don't get a whole lot of notice for when that is going to be but it is usually about an hour long so hopefully you'll be able to come by
Or really whenever if you come up 
I mean you can stop by whenever
I'm going to assume noon because that is the general lunchtime so around then
Possibly closer to 11
If things run as they did today
Kkkkk
Nate and I have been discussing gender for the past hour and I feel so tempted to interrupt with the bad news
Like all day it's been plaguing me
:(
Diviya would never forgive you
He is asking me questions about pronouns and telling me about his family and stuff
I know
Lol tell me
What did he say
I also thought it was a good response 
Also look at how sad this is
He never talks to anyone except for Diviya 
"but I guess it is about pronouns"
You know I really don't think about gender anymore. I couldn't describe my relationship to it if I wanted to. I guess this is what it is like to be cis...
Did you actually switch to "they"?
So Nate is pretty liberal and chill about these things but his fam ain't? 
Yes that's very sad
And what prompted your shift on gender fluidity? Was it talking to the ally girl?
His family is okay with LGBQA. Trans isn't a thing to them.
See, I have and still am questioning my gender and who I really am. It's not really discomfort with my body but discomfort with everything else, and I think that is fair, despite what you believe
I hate the term "femme male" so much
Or when you comment on my feminine masculinity
It really hurts
Why does it hurt?
I can't explain
I honestly don't know
Are you upset with me?
I didn't feel comfortable telling you this first. Idk. I just told Diviya because she was there
I don't know if I switched to "they" yet
I have a lot of thinking to do
My shift has been slowly occurring ever since I first read about it up to now
Lol ally girl ain't have shit on me
I was trying to talk to her about it but I assume she didn't even know what it was because her response was, "yeah... Gender fluidity... It's a huuuuuge problem"
'To be honest, I don't have the most enlightened view on this according to the social justice minded, but my views are evolving and I'm open-minded about it, I'd like to think. But to me gender is how you feel about your body. Everything else is a societal construction- one can and should be whatever kind of male or female or other gender they desire to be no matter what society deems traditional or acceptable. I wasn't OK at all with my body and so I did what I did. I just do not understand gender questioning in the absence of physical dysphoria- to me many of the individuals with non-binary identities seem to express a rejection of societal gender roles in a way completely separate and disconnected from my personal experience.
No I'm not upset.
LOL @ her response
Basically I think "you do you glen coco" and go with whatever pronouns make you happy but I don't consider most non-binary identifiers to be transgender
I completely disagree with that statement. To me gender is more broad than the body, but I understand where you are coming from. Your view just wouldn't justify your need to adapt according to certain situations and around certain 'genders' or a change in voice or many other things.
Actually I take back the voice
But like interests and stuff
Yeah I don't think voice is related...
What do you mean
"You go glen coco" is the correct phrase
I am aware
Glen coco is a stand in name for anyone 
I think that non-binary is separate from transgender
I don't consider them transgender either
I didn't phrase that well
To me, most non-binary people are their gender assigned at birth (cis) but   with a social identity that is atypical to that gender
To me, the social identity is strong enough to be considered their gender
Just because someone doesn't feel comfortable going under the knife doesn't invalidate their feelings
Or their identity
I suppose we've reached an impasse then. And we'll just have to agree to disagree. I don't think you have to have surgery to be trans, but you have to have discomfort. 
Nobody says that gender fluidity is being trans 
They are separate
You know, it would be much more convenient if you were the trans one because you are significantly less transphobic
No... Gender fluidity is under the trans umbrella 
I'm still very hung up on the whole thing
For me gender and sex are two different things. What you have described is sex. You can get a sex change and satisfy your gender.
Under certain conditions it can be under the trans umbrella 
It's funny you are lecturing me of all people about this. 
To me being trans is a very shameful thing to be hidden and never brought up. And I wonder if I influenced you to feel this way. I guess I am glad you don't see it in such a bad light but I am the type of person to never wish it on another human being. If not doing what I did (can't even say the word) was compatible with me not killing myself I wouldn't have done it no matter what. 
One thing I can explain
Is when you say you need a "masculine man" I feel like I will never completely reach either of those terms
What if I said I liked tall guys. Would you be that hung up on that? I mean you probably will never be 6' 4". But I don't think that would bother you as much. Why this?
I feel uncomfortable with my gender in these situations the same way you feel uncomfortable with your sex when it comes to having sex
Wow fuck you
?
What here was insulting? I'm sorry?
Wasn't meant that way at all
I'm just sensitive about my gender but not my body
Alright, I got you. I think I understand your definitions and feelings.
And even if I don't fully, I respect your judgment and decisions.
I just
I think about what you would be feeling if I said this to you while you were transitioning
And that's what really upsets me about this whole thing
I understand that you are confused but I'm really sad right now
I'm sorry. I think I am projecting some of my resentment towards myself into you, and I don't mean to be doing that.
And I know this isn't comparable to being trans but I think that my topic is very sensitive to me and I don't have many sensitive topics
And I also didn't know that this was such a big deal to you until right now, you just brought it up for the first time today after making fun of it for months. 
But I'm sorry for fucking up when you needed support
It's just a very hard topic for me. 
When you brought up the basketball thing, I felt that if I had brought that up when you talk about having a vagina instead of a penis and how it makes you sad or whatever, you would be super pissed off with me
I think when I've mentioned that the way you feel about sex is how I feel about not satisfying you in a relationship, it's been a gender thing
*not basketball, height
In my head basketball and height connected hahah
And this is why I constantly wonder why you are with me
If you want a masculine man you should know that I can't be that
You're saying that in the same way that you're "supposed" to only like dick but you're with me, I'm supposed to only like men but I'm with you?
I am not primarily or exclusively attracted to masculine men, actually. 
That's not what I'm saying at all
I'm saying that you feel like you can't satisfy because you aren't a masculine man
In the same way I feel I can't satisfy you because lack of dick
If you brought up discomfort with your body and I threw in the height thing you would be upset. I would never discuss body preferences to you, and I want you to respect that when it comes to gender for me.
I was just trying to say that people have preferences but dating outside of them is often no big deal. I'm sorry though.
How am I supposed to feel when you have literally told me that feminine guys aren't your thing
When you said, "I'm done with them"
Direct quote
Yes I know but can we move past that
That was one time
I was being dumb
I was upset
And if I said that I love penis up the ass
I said something I didn't mean
I get it
You would never move past that
You're right.
Thank you for understanding
I mean it
And I care about you
I feel like I can't even ask you what's up or change the subject right now
I'm in such a daze
My face is warm
Ok and also you have made me realize that I have no body preferences
Just the female hair though
I feel like such a dick
I wonder if any of this changes the way you feel for me.
I was upset for a while but I feel like the last thing I said perfectly captured my feelings
Do you want me to express how I feel bluntly or to keep it to a later and less emotionally charged time?
Bluntly
To some extent it is a point of pride for me to be with a cis gay guy, because it affirms my identity and helps me feel a part of mainstream culture. It doesn't change how I feel about you if you aren't, and I absolutely don't judge you for finding a deeper and truer understanding of who you are, but it is a bit like Toby saying that I made her realize she was pan and Anna that she was bi. 
And I don't mean to make this about me
But I wanted to get my feelings out into the open so they don't fester
That bothers me
A LOT
But I don't feel like commenting right now
I would rather you just say what you have to say but if you don't feel like it that is ok
Also I'm probably being insensitive
Insensitive to your sexuality
But I think that if you were with me and I detached myself from my gender and you can no longer claim this identity because you are with a GQ person, then your feelings naturally shouldn't change and you should care about me regardless  
When I think of love I don't refer to any mainstream or other people 
I don't feel like I need to form a gay identity
I think queer sums it up
Like what happens if I detach from this gender? Do I damage your sense of pride? 
Why even be with me and risk that?
Hahahah that's pretty funny, although a terrible generalization. It's not common, but not all Muslims keep Ramadan.
I'm not going to leave you over this, because I already care about you too much, but if I were to meet another individual who off the bat said they were GQ or trans, I would not consider dating them. Again this too probably sounds insensitive to you. This predicament we are in is, to me, like the following:
A woman dates a man, Harold. They fall in love and marry. Harold later comes out as trans and they stay together and remain attracted to each other despite her discomfort that she eventually gets over because she loves this person.
In an alternate universe, the same woman meets Helen. She used to be called Harold, but transitioned early in life. The woman is heterosexual and so the two become lifelong best friends and the woman does not consider ever going any further. 
 Aimee I really can't even believe you right now
Really? I don't think that is a fair criticism of the joke. That specific group of Muslims follows Ramadan. They would probably bend the rules if they were told the full story.
I do not understand how someone could be unaccepting when I am the same person with the same body
This doesn't affect you significantly
Fuck, man
No it doesn't affect you and me
You think that GQ opens potential trans
No
I don't
But in the same way that everyone is allowed preferences, I am too
I am sure there are many  we are friends with that would not date anyone trans or GQ 
And just because I am trans doesn't exempt me from feeling the same way. 
I understand that, but consider this:
Actually never mind it doesn't even matter anymore
No please go ahead
Again, I feel like if I said these things to you while you were transitioning and we were in a relationship you would be upset
But I can't think of a good analogy and I'm too upset to do that
Well, I agree that I should have had more restraint in the first blunt statement, but after that I was just answering your questions 
Like if i just told you that I care about you but I really want dick in the future
Was I supposed to lie
No you're right that would hurt
And that if I meet another trans guy with the original genitalia then I don't want a relationship 
No you're not supposed to lie, but idk
It makes me really really really fucking sad
I have been so open minded when it comes to you
I know :(
This just really makes me upset Aimee I can't even talk to you right now
I actually do not want to talk to you
I'm so hurt
Don't even reply
I'll text you tomorrow if I feel better, goodnight
goodnight
You know what actually
I respect your opinions 
And while it is hurtful it is just your preferences
It does not even matter to me
I wish you would be more sensitive and open to these things but if you care about me then I guess that is what matters
And if you just want to break up then that is alright too
How am I supposed to feel comfortable with someone who is not comfortable with me
I did cry and I did feel like shit and for so long I have repeated what you said to me that one February day after school pertaining to my masculinity and femininity
And for so long I have wondered why you continue to like me when I am not what you want
When I am not the person you prefer
I know you said not to reply but I wish I could speak to you face to face. I see very clearly how I hurt you, and I sincerely sincerely didn't mean to. I care for you so much, I just don't have a good reading for what will upset you regarding this topic yet, though some things I can obviously see how they would be hurtful, and that was completely my fault. I hate to see you like this. I care about you so so much and it wouldn't make a difference to me if you were anything, including trans. And I'm not in any way implying you are, but even if you lost your dick tomorrow I would still be attracted to you and would find new ways to make you happy with whatever new identity you forge for yourself. I would proudly call you by "dabae" pronouns if that is what you decided would fit you. 
:(
:(
Although I can not say I am not upset anymore, I can say that this was the right step forward, and I deeply appreciate your efforts and your commitment to me and to our relationship. 
It meant the world to me. The first time I read it I cried for a few minutes, and the second time I laughed, but I think that no matter how you feel about it, your willingness to accept me is beautiful and I am lucky for that and to have you.
I will never be the strong, macho man to carry you away, but I will love you no matter what. 
For as long as we are together
No matter who I am I will continue to try my best to make you happy and work within my power to satisfy you.
:)
Shift from :( to :) over the course of 5 texts
Why are you still up
and you were up later than usual last night too
Because of you lol
But I'm going to sleep now so goodnight
I value our conversation though so it's nbd
Worthwhile
Alrighty, sleep tighty. goodnighty 🐸
Will I see you today?
Coffee?
Sure
Ok cool. Are you going to get your dad's gift on your own?
Yeah probably
Ok cool
New day, have a good one.
Basically in my dream we saw the wizard of oz for free at ATC and you gave me some free weed that got me paranoid because I did it in my house
Did you watch the wizard of oz while stoned
Cos that would be trippy
If you guys are gonna show that kid downtown I'm actually probably gonna be doing something else
I don't think we will do that
I thought it through right after typing
Hahha no. I had to leave early because my mom came to pick me up early and you droned on and on during the show with this leukemia donation director about fashion
(Which I didn't know you were so knowledgable about!)
Oh ok then. Jay can't come to the party because he gets off work at midnight
He could still come tbh
He wants to come with Elizabeth though
So he said he probably won't
Ok, does that fact cause you to not want to go?
Yes.. I just... I do not know if it may be possible to bear a night of debauchery without Jayant!!
Lol I don't care. I thought you would want to know though.
I thought he was in Atlanta so I thought he wouldn't come
He's leaving in July
That's why he can't do my birthday
Or his, for that matter.
Hi
What's up
Hey yo. Reyna and I just chilling at cartel. Reyna is doing the breakup now :O
What's up with you?
:O I wanted to be there
I'm with Martha we are about to leave the lab
Are you at the one downtown?
Nah we are at sauce on Campbell
We are at el charro
What's you itinerary for the night
I'm at frozen yogurt rn
And then walking to Mady's at 9:30
When are you getting there
Probably 10:30
Maybe we could meet up though at like 9:30?
Yeah we are at cartel
My mom took my car and she is at a concert...
So probably yeah won't have my car until 10:30
Actually
She will be home around soon 
So I'll probably come around 930
Oh ok cool
Btw Cartel closes at 10
K
Reddit being racist as hell
"To be honest, here in Europe 90% of people wish that [Hitler would have killed them all]" (33 points)
Hey I just woke up
My mom wants me to go to church ugh
I'll read that in a sec lol I'm going to make breakfast
Ugh
Ok
Avocado omelette 
Whoops
Last one unintended
For some reason those omelettes look super unappetizing. I know they tried to have a nice aesthetic but I can't overlook the sliminess, ehh.
We need to organize a riot for this Tucson shit. Unacceptable.
Ok just kidding actually. I feel like that was well deserved. The man created such an unnecessary raucous and disruption, putting the citizens of Tucson's lives in danger.
The news didn't specify what race the man was though. #RacistMainstreamdia #ControversialWhenBlack
I don't like undercooked eggs either
I just thought the weaved avocado was cool
They were only shooting his car
Not at him
In one photo it looks like cum was drizzled over the eggs
Just to stop wheels
Probably not the most legal thing to do but I guess if there isn't any other way to stop him
Potentially endangering citizens but it's not like the guy is doing any better
"So you are American?"
lol that is terrible
If someone wrote that about black people....
"To be honest, here in America 90% of people wish that [slavery would have killed them all]" (33 points)
Well also racism is more conspicuous in Europe so there's that factor
Still not okay...
I think internet culture should help them not be so ignorant to that
It's very legal...
And standard..
They are good at shooting in a directed way
But you're right it seems pretty busy an area to be shootin
Shooting
Are you gonna go to church
I don't think Americans believe that at all
Yeah :( sorry b, I'll talk to you later.
Today's sermon was how the friendships we make in the church are more valuable than any other friendships because of a shared belief... 
I'm not saying Americans believe that, but it would be so controversial if that was a comment 
Like more than gypsies 
Do you still think Oregon/Washington trip is viable 
I honestly can not believe I used to be so religious, fuck. It makes me sick to think about.
I hear the things said during services and I can't even believe how blinded I was.
How far down the religious rabbit hole were you? Did you really buy it ally
All?
And maybe... Like end of July?
Today I slept, cleaned my room and did some laundry. I'm gonna work on Python and maybe make some soup. It has been a good day
Hey
That sounds awesome! I slept and went to church and I went swimming and now I'm eating chips w beans and guac and a burger soon
Well I mean I wanted to preach soooo pretty far down. Also I remember how I made a promise to always tithe and donate money when I had a job.
Did you end up working on that stuff?
If I end up working all of July most of my money will probably go for a trip of some kind
I'm hanging out with this kid I used to be friends with from elementary school and his dad died so he has really bad depression 
It's so awkward
They're really rich though. All the food from whole foods and they have an outdoor speaker system.
My brothers stayed in their guest house while my mom went out last Bught 
*night
My mom is tanning with her new boy so the kids are all sitting together
lol those two examples aren't my image of rich
But I gotchu
Isn't he the old guy?
I bought supplies for soup
Still need to get started
Gonna be up late tonight because I woke up around noon
How is the job hunt going
How gross boys are to Reyna :
Well I mean they have a big house near the Simbas. They go a bunch of places. 
Nope! Of course, new guy this time. He's Italian and nice and tan and actually super attractive. He's an airplane mechanic.
They met maybe two weeks ago. She left the other guy because he was active on a dating site when they were together.
What kind of soup is it?
Actually since you got your job Reyna and I are looking at places together
You basically just sent a selfie? Did you mean to send that?
Jk lol
Is he mentally stable
It's a Native American soup. Corn, squash, and beans, primarily
Anything back from bookman's?
But weren't they just casually dating? Or was he actually cheating 
He's the son of the old lady who almost died.... Probably a pity thing tbh.
That actually sounds awesome. I know I left the other soup but you should probably keep some leftovers.
Not yet :( but Reyna and I are thinking DQ and Target
Maybe I will be the next Alex at Target
They were planning on getting married. she checked when he was last active on the site and it was pretty recent so she ended it.
I heard DQ was disgusting, but probably a fun job regardless
Ouch.
Chipotle?
What's up
Why is Father's Day acceptable to celebrate but not Mother's Day
Omg chipotle is intense. They are all about team building and exercises and shit like that. Too much training.
I was just sleeping
wbu 
FWD to 5 or more people or Candace will haunt you in your sleep!
AIMEERE
Hi
I just ate my stew
I wasn't a huge fan but the fam loved it so that's good. It said to put in squash for pork as a vegetarian option, but the squash was uncomfortably sweet. 
Ah gotcha
They are one of those near minimum wage places that like to think of themselves as a career
Fucking Evangelical Africans
Bisbee tomorrow?
Answer me beyotch
That reminds me! I harvested squash from the farm and I have been meaning to make a squash boat for you.
Lol not really a career, but more career readiness skills that other minimum wage places won't provide.
That's Christian in general?
It's weird to me that they would send out a mass email for something like that. I mean even after you probably even specified that you are Jewish and shit.
:(
My grandfather is considered my father on Father's Day so...
They send out an email every day
With all sorts of announcements of this kind
I am actually so sad that I can't go. I bought a crop top for the occasion.
So any group can advertise
:(
And then they're like "oh hahah I know you probably feel left out that you don't have a dad"
:((
Ok
You never answered me about why Father's Day but not Mother's Day 
Answer me bewitch
*beyotch
My neck hurts so bad and I have mosquito bites all over :(
I don't have an answer, I don't think one is unacceptable 
I ended up doing Mother's Day
I actually don't have many
Or if I do they are not itchy
Why neck pain
Well I remember you judged the hell out of Mother's Day and it felt like you thought it was just another day
I guess what you did judge was how much meaning is associated with it
Which is problematic for me
I just don't think it's as big of a deal as your mother guilts you into feeling like it is
Mine aren't itchy until I touch them. I only notice them when I feel my body.
Neck pain because idk. I was diving and didn't maintain good form
It's not that I don't think it's meaningful
I feel like I would be the worst parent ever
So I can't even risk it
I just don't believe really in expression of care through buying people shit 
Don't really believe * shit I am tired
Why would you be the worst parent
Eh, if it doesn't work out there is always adoption!
Hahah and you thought you would be up so late
The buying stuff is exactly how my father tried to make up years of abuse lol
He didn't call me or see me or anything but sent gifts
Because I feel like it is too much of a responsibility to be in charge of creating a personality and guiding them.
I would surely fuck up somewhere along the way.
There are also so many risks one takes when having a child. 
Hahahahahah
I do get along pretty well with Alex though.
Goodnight!!!!
Hi
Hey what's up
How is your Father's Day going
What are you doing today
Hi
I am watching OITNB
so pretty good
Wbu?
What have you done and what is your plan
I might work on Python and I might do another load of laundry
What episode are you on?
I was so upset because my mom took my grandpa out to breakfast without me because she thought I was asleep
When really I was planning my bday stuff
Which, btw, is going to be awesome!!! Although Diviya and I have to stay 2 nights
I am going to go see Inside Out. Today I did laundry and planned the bday thing and listened to a bunch of music.
Also what did I tell you
The king of not addressing things from the night before
😝😝😝
We haven't gone out together in a long time
Eh I thought you came to a good conclusion of your points
I am at the end of ep 4
How are you gonna pay for it? Do you know yet?
That is true
When are you available 
No, it is too late to address the points now.
This season focused more on relationships and love and stuff rather than backstabbing and elaborate schemes.
It's $150 for two nights, so splitting isn't bad for me.
Also I give up because bookmans is being a little bitch so I'm going to try eegee's and sonic and target 
Yeah like I only ever see you to pick up other people or to drive to go meet others lol
The last time we hung out is SAAF volunteering day I think
Tonight maybe and definitely every day/night after Monday
Oh that's pretty good. What's the plan so far if you wish to share?
I wasn't going to address the points?
What is Bookman's doing?
I'm busy Tuesday and Wednesday
So tonight it must be 
So the food is all middle eastern (guess who decided that) and we are arriving on Friday because the condition is that you stay two nights. It'll probably be close people the first night and then the second night is the actual party. Diviya's mom is going to drive some people up and probably food then too. 
Is it gonna be no alcohol too, in keeping with the middle eastern theme?
And no homosexuality?
Are we stoning adulterers (Diviya)?
:)
Bookman's is super unresponsive, but I've been reading this blog and they're on some power trip because they think they are the coolest hipster bookstore around. Kinda true, but doesn't mean they can spontaneously fire people in order to attain the most hipster clerk in Tucson.
If it's just one blog saying that, they are probably just bitter
Maaaaaybe tonight. We are having Father's Day lasagna night at 5 lol
But the unresponsive bit is legit
Ok then never mind
I can't be out past like 10 anyway
And I'm actually sticking to 10, otherwise it's gonna set me up for a shitty week
No no, the theme is Lana and the food is Arab. Diviya is one clever little bitch.
Lana gives lots of leeway 
It's middle eastern or diterranean not Arab
Israeli food is much the same
But who started the trend
Jk jk 
Potentially stoning Martha too for adultery 
"Guys, if I do anything with someone else while Ahmad is gone you can't tell him"
But then she broke up a month later
She didn't act on it tho
She would
But she didn't
Which is a big difference
If I said that about you to my friends...
Can't jail someone for thinking about murdering
Like if I said that but replaced it with your name
I'm not saying it's not bitchy
But it's clearly not adultery
Definitely no homosexuality though
Even if we aren't following the path of Islam
Nature created its own righteousness
In the form of AIDS :(
Am I texting Jay?
??
What
You sounded like him
'Twas a joke
I thought you wanted me to guess if you were texting him or not lol
Am I texting Jay?
*emphasis on the I*
Italics, actually
You aren't texting Jay but you would be texting my grandpa
I grew up in the 21st century believing that AIDS was the gay disease
I honestly love this but everyone thinks it's too fucked up
Don't you think that when you move out you will be able to show your best sense of style
I always think that about myself
It's a very Tess kind of comic
No bc I'll be broke, and no one is limiting my style now
But I can see how that would be true for you
Does gpa still feel that way
There is a reason I don't wear my yellow pants lol
He does. When we were going to volunteer at SAAF he made a face and then didn't comment.
Anyway have a good day
I wonder if the top screening room at the loft is handicap accessible 
Hi
It is probably not
If you have under 15 employees it is not a requirement
I don't wear mine cos they are unflattering :P
What else would you wear
Hi
Inside out was so cute!
What wasn't cute though were all the families dressed up in the same outfits at the mall
And the long lines of family
It seems weird that people would find the mall an ideal Father's Day place
Maybe women who are into single dads come and scope them out
I actually did not know that
That's a good fact to know. In case I'm ever disabled.
I can't actually describe specific outfits but look up Malcolm Robinson on fb 
Everything he would wear
Or everything in American Apparel
What's up?
Mary Janes! And Reyna shoes
Bitchhhh
I once had all these ideas about what I wanted to wear but then I realized it takes one of two things
Either $$$ or amazing sewing and fashion talent
He's awesome tho
While looking him up I found out that Malcolm neifeld is biking across England
I always thought he was poor white trash
I might go see inside out
My aunt keeps bitching at me about my lemon bars because she thinks they are undercooked. She just doesn't know how lemon bars work cis she foreign (AKA inferior)
Lol I cannot imagine you in Mary Jane's. They are so basic and like 1975 school girl!
I see where you got the "one drop of ethnic blood" line
OITNB
I still disagree with it though. It's about visibility. Luka is half native, but blonde, so he is white to us all.
What about people who turn thrift stores into Gucci
That in itself is a real talent
That is who I aspire to be
They spend hours and hours
A shit ton of time looking 
Seriously it's a lot of work to find the gold there
"cis she foreign" cis people just never understand ANYTHING!!! Ugh. Tell me about it.
But the Mary Jane's with sass and height. Like the Reyna shoe.
Hahah yeah. What about albino people? Or what about Arabs? They could all look xican.
It's strange how the minority part of you is your identity
Also I can't believe luka is half Native American
Can you make lemon bars for the party!!! I forgot to mention that the party is a potluck. Diviya said we would cover food but we are literally having a diterranean cooking day.
which means we won't have  a lot
Maybe I don't connect the seniors because of the privilege gap. I mean they are like all white cis hetero fuckers. A couple aren't white but still cis and hetero (or bi but not in a same-sex relationship, which basically means hetero)
Yeah I can do that
They aren't white but mostly Asian (which is like extreme white) or rich. Your grade is full of white girls who say "hella"
What's so different about my grade? Like I've talked to everyone in my grade
This dinner is the most awkward thing ever. It was half an hour of my grandpa's biological daughter answering questions about how she made her food. Literally.
Luckily the biological grandson who killed the cat smokes, so he was able to go outside and escape
It's over now thank god
My grade has SJ people who aren't bitchy about it
I actually consider myself one of them
Not that many are asian in my grade
Still many white girls 
And yes. Hella
Diviya and who else?
I still dislike the SJWs
Or their philosophy at least
Is the dinner ending?
Idk your grade is just more open
Less uptight
Less traditionally high schooler
Yes it's over. It was awful.
Even the people who were white had their ethnic best friend. Like Eric Arellano and Malec.
Parthib 
Lots of the Hispanic people were white, like ethnically Hispanic but racially white
Amanda, Vicky, Larissa, eric
Henry
Diviya, Martha, more Nate now, Paige, Nina, Annika, etc.
Martha is not AJ
SJ
Is Nina, really? I did not know that
To me a vital component of SJism is not only holding the progressive views, but being outspoken
Nina's huge on sexual assault
Calling people out
Martha doesn't do that, at least I haven't witnessed it
She called out Reyna for masturbating because it was a violation of her body
Lol
LOL
that's not really SJ tho
That's just weird
But now she has sex SOOO
She is outspoken about class warfare
I think I only said Martha by association with Diviya 
We do have some boring people though. Samer, Eva, Casey, Sumeet, Keshav, straight boys, Rainy, Francisco
Nina posts stuff on her Facebook about single moms and shit
Sexualizing bodies
She's very feminist and outspoken about sexual harassment and rape
Thank God she found Ivan
Sumeet has his own social thing going on
Why Ivan?
Right. Robotics.
Like why did she pick him
And Eva too with the Jews
They are both into the underground, obscure culture thing. She loves his music. They are both people who love to argue and they are both outspoken about their beliefs. They talk and talk and talk and talk.
She would be Woody Allen's perfect companion
She's just young enough for him 
Also she says he makes her feel secure
Lol
How do you feel about incestuous relationships
Nice in porn, not reality
What's up
Maybe nice in reality if nobody finds out
And both are single 
Nothing really. Finished an application for Panera. Then I started sonic but accidentally attached my mom's resume so I gave up lol.
Listening to music
Wbu
We totally could have gone out ugh
It's so stupid because the eegee's applications say "Position - Store #" but they don't specify where that store is and if you look up "eegee's store 40" or whatever you can't find it
Hey sorry I totally missed your texts
Missed notification idk
That's really dumb 
Hopefully the job hunt works out soon
I am so horny
Though I fear your applications centered on trendy joints will make shit more difficult
I am too but
I've jerked off three times in the past day
I was about to go to sleep...
 too but that's normal for me
Ok well
:(
?
Wish we could have gone out tonight
Did you jerk off to invest?
Incest
Hahah no
I've been thinking about our past sexual experiences and anal
Anyway
I was watching OITNB and it reminded me of the Diviya TSA experience
But anyway yeah
Good night
Tuesday?
I think it might actually work
Ok cool I'll see
Goodnight
 This interaction between pipet and daya about wealth
Literally me
5 bedrooms, housekeeper not maid, ballet lessons
"Money only buys happiness up to 75k! [thinking 75K is like nothing and daya gives a look].... oh I guess that's a lot"
I meant 5 bathrooms
Piper
My aunt is arguing with me about whether our aunt Jemima is maple
Syrup. This is the result of a linguistic difference- all normal syrup is called maple in Israel, but priced pretty damn high. After tasting it, she is nearly sure it is maple. And that maple comes from a cedar tree. I concede. It's not worth arguing. 
She also doesn't know that the fake maple in Israel is fake 
That scene literally reminded me of you. I feel like I am dating Piper and I am on of the xicans. Still more educated than the blacks; we have cultural intuition! That is actually probably why Reyna and I think that, you know, what we told you at cartel.
I don't think that is a linguistic difference if the label on Israeli syrup says maple when it's really cedar...
The cedar point was separate
It's not actually cedar
She's just very wrong
Also, I am surprised that Mr. 5-Bathrooms Ballet Housekeeper's family bought Aunt Jemima syrup! I expected some agave or prickly pear out of you guys.
Way to not meet my expectations.
Anyway 
Have a good day. Sorry if I offended you.
Lol Ima snot offended
I'm not
What a fantastic autocorrect
We have agave
And we just ran out of maple
Only reason we have the shitty stuff is that no one uses it
I use agave or maple
Can you be flacka? I like her
Those booties
Do you want to do something after scouts
I can't do anything tomorrow at all
No time
Kinda need to know soon though
Hey
Come to black crown if you want
I'm here
Can u get me or no?
K well I'll see you around 8:40
When are you done at scouts
830
Hi
What is up
Eating at subway Abu
Wbu
How was your day
I didn't respond earlier bc I thought you were busy
Sleepover is off btw
Why is it off?
My day was great, I love working in the lab
Also sorry I was so bitchy today.
But I didn't do anything special
It's ok it really wasn't that bitchy
I am at home 
Might watch OITNB
Reyna and I just didn't want to see Martha 
How was your day
Are you serious
That's really bitchy
Like REALLY bitchy
We just can't stand lab talk nobody else understands except you two
You complain I'm so symbolic but you should look at her
We literally didn't talk abou that
With Diviya like at all
If you guys don't want us to talk at all about that you need to be more active in the conversation
Because you two hardly talk
That's really mean
And really not a good reason
You could just tell her not to talk about that 
Off because Bella feels sick
My day was great. Cleaned the turtle pond, pulled weeds, cartel in afternoon, thrifting, tea, and epic cafe
Yeah when we last had a coffee night it was literally Martha showing us texts with guys she thinks like her
And you say I'm not active
You only talk to her so much because you literally work with her every fucking day
And because she got you a job
I've tried talking to her and having interesting conversations with her but it is literally boys boys boys and texts texts texts
We used to be closer
But you guys could have mentioned bowling or something 
Why couldn't you get me tonight? I really don't understand
We actually talk about a lot of things, and I think the job brought us closer but the relationship isn't all about that at all 
We decided to go bowling spontaneously
It wasn't a plan
It was because you guys weren't there and we wanted to kill time until Diviya came, but she came early
But it was pretty bitchy to get pissed about that. You do so much stuff without me. 
I thought you got off at 8
Whenever I do stuff without you you are with the seniors or whatever
And I almost always invite you
And they were gonna leave at 8:30 so it would have ended the night with them if I left, plus I wanted to go to sleep before like 10:15 which wasn't realistic if I went out with you at 8
Not true at all
Like your Reyna and Bella nights recently, or Jen, or Zayna
I got off at 8:30 too
Right, I thought it was 8
But the late issue still persists
Okay well those are during the day when you are busy
Now yes, but not in the past
And it's not like we didn't invite you today
Why does it matter
Because you were unreasonably upset today and I am trying to show you it is unreasonable
It's not like I wanted to see a movie or anything like I would not have even kept you out late
ok but still
It would be past then
I know us
Okay
It's over though
It's not a big deal
It was a misunderstanding
Okay
Seriously it's not like we will explode if we don't hang out alone for a bit
It will happen! It has just been a busy while
And stop okay'ing me instead of saying what you want to say
Well you already know what
We won't explode
It's fine
Anyway, I'm leaving for a week this Sunday
Glad we have come to agreement
So I wanted to do something
To where?
We will do something don't worry
I don't think it's that fucking unreasonable to want to be with you
But I'm just upset rn 
Camp
I don't think it's unreasonable I just think you ought to realize the circumstances, and that just because it didn't work out today (after you told me to anticipate that it wouldn't work out today) doesn't mean it won't work out all week
But there really aren't any restricting circumstances 
We could have done something the past week or whatever
We choose to go with the crowd
And I don't object to that, but I'm just saying
It's not like there isn't any time to do things alone
I'm sad that I didn't make more time or ask you to do something
And even if we don't do anything this week I would understand, idc
It's really not a big deal sergio, we can hang out this week, no reason to be regretful or sad about it, seriously
Okay
Ok I'm going to sleep, so good night. I hope you feel better about whatever is actually getting you down because I feel like it is something deeper. This really isn't big enough of an issue to make you this upset.
What the fuck
Okay whatever then
How can you invalidate my reason like that.
Because I really thought it was true
Diviya said you were being weird too today 
She was being very weird
She said you two third wheeled her hardcore
And spoke about things in front of her but wouldn't include her
And so she left
We invited her to a movie...
I don't think she understood that
She literally said you guys talked about a movie and didn't invite her
This is good
I feel like we just need to release some stuff
Thanks!
I thought you were going to sleep
Then I got dragged into fb
 I'm sorry
Are you upset with me?
No, I just think you need to realize your role in relationships more, and put yourself in the shoes of others.
Like to all of us you were being super weird today
Like saying we couldn't hang out because you were busy
Being bitchy about the bowling pic
Okay
And that
?
That's really passive aggressive
Well I realize you are wrong, I'm upset with myself for it, I don't know what else you want me to say
*you are right
That's a far better response than "Okay"
When is Elliot's thing
Friday night
Okay
Are you going to bed now
Ya
Alright :(
What do you want to do tomorrow? Or does Thursday work best?
Thursday is better
Actually Wednesday
Wednesday
Is alright
But it would be at like 7
But tonight might also work
So Diviya and Martha and I were gonna talk things out tonight over coffee
But Diviya said I don't respect her because I accused her of cheating (?!!!!!!???!???!?? That pissed me off) and accused her of flirting with Marcus 
So I said that maybe we do need time apart because she doesn't value my openness with that kind of stuff and that I respect her enough to tell her what I think about it
Oh ok, then Wednesday!
Then she Unfriended me
What
It was crazy
By the way, time apart is like never a good option sergio
I was up until 1 am :(
Is that why she left the group?
I told her that we need to think about what this means before we say this
Like to you the answer to difficulty is time apart but I don't think that's true
But that's true, you all should think before acting rashly
"i spend so much time with him because i feel like I'm losing all my friends and he is away from all of his. We bond over our loneliness"
-about Marcus
Yes. She wants time away from us.
Nah, I've also come to realize that I don't like time apart
We had such a great time last night 
Is your bday off?
And if I do then I'm not going to say it
Things will probably be mended by then
That's also what I think
But is it alright if i just have this night with Martha?
Yeah that's fine
She said last night she was upset
She feels like she doesn't belong
Maybe she is ostracizing herself because she feels guilt
It's like when you pull yourself away from your partner when you cheat 
I don't know why she said she didn't cheat because she literally did
Idk what she calls cuddling and making out with another guy
I told her my opinion on it and she got upset
Then she said that she hasn't felt the spark she used to feel with Nate, but also she hasn't seen him in 3 weeks
Ok well Martha's parents want her home for family dinner so
It makes me uncomfortable how involved you are in this shit. I feel like I can't tell you anything. Someone else already probably has, you know?
Anyway, I don't really know anymore
It's like we aren't in a relationship together anymore
But everyone else is in it too. Completely expanded.
I'm not even involved in this
I don't know what's going on
I have no angle
Sure but it still creates problems like last night.
I feel the way you probably did when you left basis and I stayed behind 
Ok but it's really not that big of a deal. We won't talk about it in front of you, that's it. It's fine
Like this whole thing could easily be avoided through basic communication 
Yeah I know it's all good
❤️❤️❤️
I wouldn't have been upset if you said it bothered you
Don't be upset or whatever 
I'm not upset
Literally I am not upset
I just don't get all this fighting
That seems totally unnecessary
No I know but I want us all to be happy
Like Martha literally wasn't mad at you at all
You said there was bitchiness between you two but really you were just mad at her
That's true but I cleared it up and explained it to her
Ok what's the problem with Diviya?
Ok but how did this even start
Like what led to this
Reyna and I "made plans" in front of her
And she was upset about what I said about Marcus
Like that day in black crown
This will blow over, just let it be
Dumb AF
I can't wait to show you my new bags!!!
How is your day going so far
What's your plan tonight
Bags?
My day is going pretty good
I have a bass lesson and I might go to the family friend after, don't know yet.
We didn't get much done because the chemical hoods were down for maintenance
My bags
You know I feel like part of this issue stemmed from the fact that I decided to tell you more about my day because you said I was always vague, so I give you the details and then it is all biology
Nice bags, love the hairy
Shitt
Shirt
 
I actually don't think so. It doesn't bother me when you do it. In groups, yes.
You look so angry and long legged in the last photo
"You know that I love you boy, hot like Africa, rejoice"
- Reyna
Attempting to sing Alejandro
But I'm sorry the hood was down :( hopefully you got to be productive in other ways
What is up
Isn't that correct lyrics?
Hey boy
I had this amazing chicken breast and honey mustard sandwich with clam chowder soup on 4th ave.
More photo shoots hahah
No no, it's hot like Mexico
What's up with you
Nate has been complaining to me about Diviya and the relationship 
I've changed into 5 different outfits today
How is your sex drive?
My mom used Netflix for the first time in her life last night and she watched a Jennifer Lopez movie
What restaurant?
I just got home, leaving to bass soon
What is Nate saying
My sex drive is gr8
How is yours
Why j Lo? Ew
Love her but not her movies
It was at bison witches!
Very very cool. Well Reyna and I don't know what to do. We were supposed to see a movie but idk.
My sex drive is too high to handle if you catch what I'm saying
!!!
! ! !
Nate just told me basically what Diviya said. She wants him to be meaner, she doesn't feel a spark, she feels numb, etc. 
Lol I know. J Lo's movies are super lame
If you don't go with family friend you should come with me
Yeah I'll be free
I'm still on 4th rn. I think I'm going home soon so I'll be there
:( for Nate
Honestly the best thing for all parties would probably be a break up
For all parties including us?
Or their breakup benefiting the group?
No
I mean both of them
Do you want one of those cool xican candles for your bath?
Kinda over my candle phase
But thanks!
Hahah alright. Maybe you can wait at the Starbucks until I get home or I'll let you know where I am when you get out of bass. Have a good lesson!
I'm done what's up 
Ok so I'm on Speedway and Kolb. Kinda close to my house.
Ok let me know when you get there
I'm just nearby
Hahah I see you I'll be out soon
?
K
Oh yeah yesterday I went to magpies on 4th to apply for a job and Emily Jue was the one to give/take our applications and it was such a transformation for her to see from 8th to 12th grade me.
Also the people of Karachi, Pakistan are experiencing a heatwave and because they are keeping Ramadan over 650 people have died :(
Did she say anything
Did I ever tell you that my jew choir co director/ synagogue musical director was murdered a few years ago
......
Murdered is pretty intense
That's really sad tho
Yeah her ex boyfriend stabbed her
Cos he was jealous that she moved on
She was like "wow.... You're a senior" and she looked really surprised to see me
She was just a quiet sweet older lady 
How did you hear about it?? That's soooo fucking sad
Like I knew her personally 
I mean I could understand getting upset but never to the point of homicide
That happens in the book I'm reading and the hate process (to the point where you want to kill) is explained
I remember she told me I was a pretty soprano and that I needed to sing louder because it was nice, even though I choked during the audition
They make it sounds beautiful
It was very not beautiful to see it happen to her
There is no way you used to be a soprano
Holy shit
When did that change? When did you decide to change your voice?
No, I understand, but it never hit me that things like that were not as poetic as the book makes it sound. Like You don't consider it until you hear about it really happening
No I was an alto
A low alto
Like basically a tenor
I just had a lot of range
For the purposes of that choir I could have been a soprano
They only divided into soprano and alto despite the fact that they had guys, so the sopranos were also mezzo sopranos and high altos
But yeah I just had a lot of range. I could go tenor up to maybe mezzo
Changed it maybe 7th grade 
Someone just tapped my window
So scary lol almost died #eastside
You want to know something sad
My church choir literally did not care about technique whatsoever
The kids in my choir did not sing according to their capabilities. We all sang songs in unison regardless.
I feel like I really missed out on a lot of this terminology because I am lost
I mean I did play guitar but voices are different
Wtf are they gone 
I hope so. Did your current house get broken into or was it the winter haven one?
The ADT commercials fucked my childhood up
This one
But I think we left the back door open
How it works is
Highest-lowest female voice:
Soprano
zzosoprano
Alto
(Contralto)
Highest- lowest male voice:
(Counter tenor)
Tenor
Baritone
Bass
I'm a bass now
Then why is it that sometimes people refer to males using the female scale?
What do you think I am?
They may have a range more comparable to one of the female voices
Also, tomorrow are we doing something? Because if not I got invited to wyatt's house lol. You could probably come.
He is making his guests coffee/tea
Like Chris colfer or especially alex Newell
What time
Oh shit it's at 2 in the afternoon. Might be a little awkward, idk.
Oh yes Chris colfer. So if you're a bass then I am probably baritone
Probably
Good night boy
Maybe a baritenor
That is the golden voice, they say
A low tenor/high baritone
Oh I was half reading that and I thought you said good night my golden boy
But you didn't say that, so I will hahaha
Good night my golden boy
💛☀️😘
Hi
Hey, how was your day?
Really fantastic
The highlight was Martha's dad asking bitchy questions that were really just statements to the other researcher during a meeting because she kind of stole his work and then conducted it poorly
Also I did my own fecal DNA extraction all by myself
Wbu?
Hahaha remember when you thought Martha's dad was scary because he asked about your backpack
Congratulations haha!!
Btw Veris meant what's appropriate for the camping trip because he doesn't know who is going
Like the substances
Today I went out for breakfast, looked around at clothes, bought hiking shoes, got lunch at some xican place, then went to wyatts. I'm still here
Madeleine is coming
What's up with you
I just finished getting a haircut
Oh
Whoops
What's your plan for tonight
Are you going to mt lemmon Saturday??
Guess so
Martha brought it up today as if I was in on the plan
I wasn't but I am now
Why now??
?
I'm not going
Because she told me about it
Why
Who can drive and what is going on up there
Madeleine just asked me if I was going with you on Saturday and I said idk what was going on
My plan for tonight is uncertain. I'm w Reyna and Madeleine and Wyatt now
Ok I'm free if you down. Let's talk about the camping when we meet up
Or I could come there if that's not awk
I didn't know it was camping
Oh right maybe not
Ok well I mean you could come to wyatts but we are just sitting at this table drinking tea
And talking
Do you want the address or do you want to do something after?
When do you plan on leaving?
Maybe you can come pick me and Reyna up at 8:15
1348 E 10th st
Aight 
On my way
Prolly 8:10
Here
lol
?
??
???
Bitch
Oh hi sorry
Ok be put
Killin me boo
 
Also omgggggg
I have always agreed with the sentiment of that comic
That the north has as much if not more of a race problem, it's just more subtle. In the south people are either racist or not, but not the inbetween bs 
They get the nice white picket fence and we get the plain metal gate
Why omg?
"We"
Intentional haha. Yeah I hate how even here the people won't acknowledge that they are being indirectly racist (like me)
Well Nate was telling me he feels uneasy with his relationship sometimes
Like when Diviya went to hang out and drink with the Arab kids and the guy "came onto her"
And he says that he was only gone for a few weeks and that happened. Then he said if he were apart from her for two months he worries about if she would be faithful.
Sorry the preview of the pic cut off the text
So I was just like what
I'm the same way
Also indirectly racist like you, that is
But when will they be apart for so long?
I mean he doesn't have any illusions that she isn't going to stay with him indefinitely, right?
The two months was him talking about being apart for SRPs. He thinks they're going to be together until they leave for college, kinda like us.
Oh
Yeah
Also it's weird how we claim to be so progressive but it's just inherently who we are
I don't claim to be progressive
Although I feel like if a person of any skin color was wearing baggy clothing and bling then I would be uncomfortable 
Anyway goodnight!! 😜
Sorry I spaced
Good night
The eggs in my house are literally frozen.
Sup
Weird
Watching inglourious basterds and eating custard. Wbu? How was your day?
My day was good, I finished the fecal DNA extractions and then did some cost analysis because I had time to
How was your day?
Also we went to beyond bread and allegro gelato
Did you make the custard
Cost analysis for what?
My day was fun! Finished Annie Hall, watched The Artist is Present, jerked off a few times, read a little, listened to some music.
Hahah nooo. It was good though. Peanut butter pie with Oreo bits. What gelato flavor did you get?
I'm so excited for tomorrow
Also I watched a lot of performance art and read about the philosophy and stuff
The fecal DNA extraction. Basically I wanted to know how much it would cost for me to run my own optimization experiments
Sounds like you had a great day
I got horchata gelato
Was yours from culver's?
That looks yummier than your eggs...
Wow. My eggs turned out pretty well, thank you very much. I did have to throw out some frozen egg yolk from the pan though, lol.
Nah the stores sell it now, kinda like how in store gelato was a trend.
That picture: when white people try to make 'ethnic' food
White people have recipes...
And Internet
Lol
LOL
LOOLOLOLOL
That's my new reaction picture I love it so much
Because I'm too good for reaction gifs 
Did gay boy say anything today
I told him about Campbell
And he was fangirling
He thought it was super cute
Horchata gelato sounds sooooooooooo good, ugh. I am more of a coffee flavored gelato/ice cream person though. There is no other flavor that beats it.
Also green tea ice cream
Fangirling over the fact that you went with your boyfriend and a mutual friend, lol?
Or that the place exists?
I still thought the whole night was romantic. Like not specific parts but the big picture.
Yeah the big picture
Green tea <3
I don't like fruit flavors so much
Going to sleep boo boo, excited for tomorrow, good night!
🌚
Hahahahah see you tomorrow 😘 goodnight!
Gay marriage legal all over the U.S. now bitch huh whatchu say about that haaaaahh 💖
❤️❤️❤️
I'm going to die
I got a haircut and I want to cry
It's the worst thing I have ever gotten in my life
I'm like half bald
It will grow back :(
That's not even a joke
Even faster if you take folic acid
I feel bad but pic?
The lady majorly fucked up
Should I get the top off too?? I look like a lesbian
Please open the snap asap
I'm going back to the place. I like actually want to die.
You aren't bald
My sides are like that too
No don't take the top off
Can you send a head on shot?
So we went back and there were a bunch of people and my mom goes "I don't like this. He's a boy, not a young punk rocker. He needs something appropriate" all loud and proud in front of everyone I was so embarrassed 
Now I look like I belong in the Russian army!
aning the top is off
At least no gay Boy Scouts will be hitting on me all week
Elliot cancelled his party???
That's what Nate told me because Elliot works, but Nate and I suggest moving the small group to your place?
Reyna would probably also feel more comfortable 
It would be you, me, Diviya, Nate, Martha, Reyna, and Madeleine (?)
We could swim
So ya?
No sorry
Let me think about it but I don't think so
At least not with substances
We don't have any anyway but ok
Don't be salty bruh
Maybe we can go get coffee and see where things go
Lol no I'm not, but I can't really know last minute otherwise my mom will be upset that I didn't stay the night (it's either that or babysit). Also Reyna has to know if she is going to stay the night with u or family
And basically I want nudes
Jk
I guess I'll bring my bag just in case and tell Reyna the same
So what is the plan?
Sorry b I am at work Ya see
Sorry I can't confirm yet
Send nudes in the bathroom
Jk lol. I'm gonna do it one day though
So I'm meeting Reyna at cartel around 7 and we are both bringing backup clothes. We kinda wanted to go to casa video and pick out movies too.
WHAT THE FUCK
HOLY SHIT
Shit I am sorry
🔥🔥🔥🔥
No no no, I just didn't think you would
Didn't know you were a bad boy ;)
Ughhhh quiero tener sexo contigo 
I actually can't believe you did that I'm so happy
It is so funny haha
;) :)
What's up
Getting ready to go to cartel, wbu?
Just coming home now
I've decided I'm gonna do a faux hawk
It works
What
WHAT
Why
Look at the snap
It's so good
Aight
What is lissa's last name again?
Gottlieb lol, why?
I was confused by her post
Wtf is up with all these professional pics by her
Btw I'm at cartel Campbell
Oh yeah, she hates her parents so she wants no affiliation to them when she turns 18 
aning a name change 
Demi inspired her to model
Oh, cool. 
And sad
I'll be there around 7:45
Kkkkkkkkl 💕
Shitting etiquette when you are at a friend's house 
Do you still get horny and want sex often
Hi
Ya
I don't believe in shitting etiquette 
My mom literally wanted me to come home so we could go eat at McDonald's 
lol I was gonna say. You give noooo fucks when it comes to that. I've always wondered how other people manage with that when they sleep over.
Nobody ever seems to fart.
I wonder if the current manager at McDonald's is satisfied with his job and his life
Reyna's parents story makes me sad
That's a dumb reason 
Well maybe she wanted to go out but there is not $ :(
And yea! Honestly it's amazing that she is so successful and not fucked up given that background
I always feel gross going to McDonald's because the burgers are so small and you can eat three without realizing you had 1350 calories.
There's food at home.. She said she didn't want to be alone when she took my brother to play at McDonald's,
I could never imagine a parent showing their kid different types of cocaine
I read this article today on the NYT that said that having good quality sex over good quantity sex can bring you happiness equivalent to having an extra $50,000
So Thats why I was wondering how you feel
Also there was this study where couples doubled the number of times they had sex (1 time a week becomes 2 times a week, etc.) and they actually because less happy
I do enjoy having sex with you but it is SOOOO much better when we are alone like in the car
That's why I limit myself to one item at fast food places
at the coronet they have drink menus lol
I feel like forcing sex to happen when one party isn't peachy keen on it usually ends up worse and creates resent
Is that strange?
House alone > car > not alone
I just fell asleep inside McDonald's
What do you consider our recent sex times?
There were times I felt were acceptable to leave because everyone is asleep but you get tired so fast hahah
I wanted to do the bathroom sink
And then all day I wanted to do that
Ummmm where have you been with a drink menu?
I remember when Larissa was very into fashion and she considered going to FIDM
What's a fashion degree from Williams worth?
What happens if you miss a day of taking T
 Lol williams is so above offering fashion degrees
I take it weekly
But sometimes I'm a day or two late. Nothing happens. I sometimes take it early the next week so it stays on the same day of the week
Just this week I went to el charro
They have a drink menu
Lots of sit down restaurants do
How did you fall asleep
Lol well Reyna was the one who texted me and told me they gave her a separate drink menu. I assume it wasn't only alcohol but juices and teas and stuff.
I know many restaurants do but they are usually for alcohol 
But what if you were to stop taking it altogether or if you skipped a week or two
I was actually just sitting at a table in the play area and then I put my head down and fell asleep.
I'll read yours right now
Then I'm probably gonna fall asleep 😕
You know, you actually don't have to read the opinion piece if you don't want to. Some of them aren't interesting but I read them because of the different perspective.
How do you really feel about sending me nudes and vice versa 
To some people it is incomprehensible.
One lesbian relationship that is actually super cute
Or just female female
Oh, a separate non-alcoholic drink menu
That's more uncommon
I really don't mind it
They cute
And Isabella looks stoned or she just cried
I just looked at some of the library resources I have access to through brown
And it is ridiculous
Any academic anything I want
NYT subscription
Soviet film magazine archives...
It just goes on and on. Literally anything you can think of and more
She got those Colombian cocaine connections
That is seriously so unfair. What do we get at the UA? Does it depend on what your major is or are these resources available to all Brown students?
Honestly wtf
Maybe you could send some interesting things, please
God, they are literally preparing you for upper class life
Alex: "mom, I'm black!"
Pretty sure most of these resources are present at all research universities 
Maybe not the NYT
But the major databases
The soviet film shit is probably because they have a class in that
It is available to all brown students
I'm working on something right now but I'll read your stuff in a few
Ok read these two and ignore the other one. It's like when I recommended bachelorette. Don't waste your time.
What are you up to?
The first also gives background to why the Supreme Court case came up, which you asked today but neither Reyna nor I knew
“There is something wonderful about being part of an oppressed community,”
As fucked up as that sounds I actually understand where he is coming from
I am about to play with photoshop
Oh I was actually asking about AZ but thanks
And I agree, I think that way too
I don't want to be expected to be married and settled at 30 with a white picket fence and 2 kids
There was something special about having a forbidden love. About nobody in my family knowing about my sexual orientation or my lovers. About having boyfriends and feeling risky to show affection because of the world we live in. It's nauseating how much support [straight] people have been giving the LGBTQ community.
Like I really had a different experience, intensified by the religious upbringing
I wouldn't go that far buddy
That it is nauseating?
It just seems too sudden
It is definitely great and all but I mean it is not like I need it or something 
I can't explain why it bothers me
I went through my photoshop obsession in 9th grade hahah
I feel like being gay means my life has no expectations
There's a different attitude about having kids and all sorts of things that straight people are expected to do because the mechanics and the society work together with them.
*for them
Yo, you asleep?
Also I finally learned what code switching is
Well goodnight then
Hi!
I once went 4 days without shitting during camp bc of the KYBOs (camp bathrooms)
But hey hey hey
LOL THE VIDEO
Reyna and I saw a Lamborghini yesterday 
And I looked it up. $397K.
The second article is sweet
I feel that the NYT has a way of expanding on the feelings we all experience, laying out the logic of it all and making it a story.
It's funny to me how for some people the label 'religious' means good character and ethics whereas for us it's lunatics 
What kind of rich person would get a Lamborghini with camo print............. ???????????????????????????? 
The second article about sex? Lol
I thought the marriage one was the sweetest
Oh sorry I meant the marriage one
Idk he was old and white
Maybe actually like 60
I've been thinking about that too, about the NYT. Their logic is so consistent and the stories are so personal and relevant that it impacts me more than other things I read.
This whole anti-white sentiment actually bothers me ;( it's so counterproductive 
I thought the part where the author was like "every day, for every one thing I get annoyed with my husband about there are 1000 things that make me feel lucky to be married to him/in love" 
That was so cute 
That also probably explains it. White men and their hunting.
Those articles make me get all pensive and reflective about my life and my struggles and my relationships. It's not even after the article, but there are so many easy to read, yet complex one-liners every so often that make me stop and think.
Like after reading those articles last night I wrote a little journal entry about my experiences because of the articles
Priscilla's boyfriend:
What the duck
Fuck
FUCK
FUCK
Is that perhaps just a flattering photo
Because otherwise
How did she do that
He said he fell in love with her the moment he saw her
And he was clingy at first and really touchy and she told him she wasn't interested and that he needs to be himself
Then once he was they started dating
Pretty sure it is camo to denote military service 
She said "he's literally hotter than me"
^ Ya
Wow
He works for a delivery service so he gets to work out his muscles 
It's not that Priscilla is unattractive. She is just short
Jay is into that
She is average
In face and body
You know, I just looked through her pics and I think she is pretty attractive 
Her personality is also really fun
Yeah I thought it was probably a Jay thing too
His family owns the UFC and he used to be a professional boxer, but he started smoking weed and got super lazy 
The guy literally has everything
Wtf
Is he like dumb or something
Not to date her, but just in general
Priscilla got him off of weed and now he's back to working out twice a day and boxing
It was funny the way she said it
Like she helped him overcome this addiction
I'm glad I stopped smoking too. Nobody likes to be around people who are sad all the time.
He doesn't go to college
I read this article on NPR and someone was like "I love kids with troubled backgrounds. They are more interesting than kids who have everything because they have a different perspective on the world and they are strong willed and passionate"
And they have a lot of emotion too
Is he from here??
I agree. I don't even really like smoking
It's not social for me
I think he is
Yup
When are you heading out
A little after 1
But mentally I don't know when I'm going to head out
that's usually when I lose service
What are you even doing today
You seem busy
Because I'm older I don't have to do all the activities the younger kids have to do which means more free time :)
So what do you do all day
Draw, read, swim, and eat. I only have two or three one hour classes a day. 
?
How are you feeling
About what?
I'm half excited to go to camp and I'm going to miss you and my friends more than anyone else
I'm excited to sneak out at night and see the stars and shit and go swimming and being alone under trees and drawing
What about you? What's up
I just went to the grocery store 
I'm going up now so I'll see you next week
Oh ok cool well
So yeah
Have a good day and stuff, bye
Just gonna send emojis for happiness
And love
💛💋😍💁👬💖🌄🌈😜🙇😝💕🌷🐸🐢❤️
Hope you have a great time
Sorry I was driving
❤️
my mom's best friends (maybe 25 years ago)
Woman walking down the street walking her dog without any hint of anything out of the normal-  "no, you can't eat the chicken." I look down, literally a full fried chicken thigh on the sidewalk. 
Hope you are having a good trip
???????
I could be dead u know
Hi
No u couldn't
😲
You wouldn't know
How was Boy Scouts?
Ugh I was annoyed bc you didn't even say anything all week or when I was leaving and stuff but it's kinda ridiculous 
I had a great time
Yesterday was the only day out of the week I got upset because all the kids were acting rambunctious  
Sorry? I spaced when you were leaving and considered it useless to text when you were gone because you wouldn't get it
Were you in charge
Can Jen come tonight?
Yes I was
I had the art, lifesaving, and citizenship in the community merit badges
She is going out with Joseph
Joseph said
She just asked if someone was doing something tonight
Like two minutes ago
How  did you do lifesaving?
But okay
She can come only if accompanied with Joseph as far as I'm concerned, but that also isn't really something you can directly tell her
So they are watching fireworks together and might come over
Alright.
Why don't we go see fireworks?
Bella got a vibrator....
It was shipped to Raad's house
there's a pool up on the mountain and yes, it was 60 degrees every day in the water :(
We had to do body carries and rescues in the water
Okay fine I'm sorry
I'm being such a bitch. I actually have a lot to say about camp
I actually wrote down stuff every day to tell you
Shall I tell you tonight or right now?
We can do that, but aren't you having people over?
Imagine Campbell fireworks!
When do you want to meet up tonight?
Campbell would be great
We haven't established any plans
Literally what you have seen of the conversation is the whole conversation
Or we could see fireworks as a group
You could start telling me now and continue later?
Good for Bella?
That's interesting
I went swimming again and it was warm and nice
Have you been harboring this upset attitude all week
You didn't respond to me in the chat
It was all really petty
Campbell might be packed actually
Okay kinda but I really missed everyone and it pissed me off
I don't think I was being super unreasonable
Even Diviya agreed with me
I missed you a lot too
I was a little hurt that you didn't say anything and you were terse but I am over it
Unhappiness is a state of mind :P
That is voluntary
Ok let's move on
I was also thinking swimming tonight, maybe?
Or s'mores?
Or BOTH
Too hot for s'mores
I like the idea of a potluck. I'll make something.
Some of the camp songs were so funny I have decided to say some of the lines during sex
Also Ben's (ex-satanist) dad is surprisingly hot
Ben cut his hair and he looks like a surfer dude from the 70's or a French intellectual when his hair is combed back
He had a crush on this 15 year old counselor who goes to Basis pro valley
*oro
Ben to me as I was yelling and moaning: "is that a gantrum?" 
*gay tantrum*
Why did you say 9
You didn't even tell me a time
I want to go out and see the fireworks before?
What's one of the camp song lines?
Is ben gay?
Ok sorry sorry well then how did you think tonight would work
Bengay is an ointment
Why were you yelling and moaning
I had this terrible ointment after my circumcision. Whenever I hear the word ointment I think of that.
You can bring something but I doubt others will
"Have you ever seen a penguin drinking tea? Take a look at me, a penguin you will see."
That's how one song goes for 5 minutes.
NOOOOOOO he is super straight. The counselor is female. 
He is fascinated by homosexuality though. He asks so many questions.
Two questions:
1. What time at your place?
2. Fireworks as a group or no?
Ok just one thing before I move on and get back on track
You ignoring me doesn't solve things
Doesn't make things better
So even if you were right to be mildly upset, it isn't right to ignore me as a result
I don't understand the penguin song
Time at my place depends on when fireworks are. I think they are at 9
going as a group sounds fun
I don't think it could start before 10:30
Or 10
You're right, but also I didn't understand why you would ignore me in our personal chats and then acknowledge me on the group chat. I was confused.
The penguin song would have made more sense if I didn't tell you now and if you heard it 
Hmmmm. Where would be a cool place for the group to go?
Have you ever played gagaball?
Jay's idea seems cool. How do you feel about that? Getting our own fireworks
Gagaball? No?
What's that
Eh I mean it would supplement the real fireworks
I guess we could see them from the park if we wanted
Hey are you going to church
Really want that 🍆
Camp exemptions hahah
And the stories
aning I don't
I am ☔️
I see
Where would that even happen
You probably wouldn't want to tonight
Well 2 options come to mind
1. Daytime alley 
2. Your family will soon be at church?
My family will be at church except Richie is staying home..
Do you feel uncomfortable with tonight?
You're not about leaving the room anymore
A bit but mostly I would just prefer to be alone alone
No that was just last time
I'm not opposed to leaving the room
I just think it would be nice after this whole week to be alone together
My mom said I can only go out after 5ish
She says no to sleepover because I haven't been home all week, but I'll see
I doubt she will want to pick me up so it should be fine
Is that okay? After 5?
Yeah that'll be fine 
Is it a sleepover or no?
My mom finally said yes
Yeah
Don't jerk off pls
I realize it may be too late
Not too late
I had the same thought
To preserve this energy
You sure you have to wait until 5
Do you want it too
LOLOLOL
Of course I want it
To tell you the truth
I didn't jerk off at all this week because I wanted mastersex
I stopped myself so many times
I only ever thought of you
Rubbing my dick against you, grabbing your ass to pull you on top of me
I got so hard writing that :(
:)
I seriously want nothing more than to be inside you right now ugh
We need to do it more than once today
At least three times
One more reminder pic?
Can I have bottom stuff too?
K
Soooo thick
No j/o
Did you shave your abdomen and thighs?
Whatever you do don't shave around 🍆
It's soooo nice
Omg I just got off the phone with Madeleine 
Because she sent a snap that said "um" and I thought I accidentally sent her a nude
But it was for her hair lol
I was freaking out
Sorry to ruin the mood
God I love your thighs and legs so much
No I didn't shave anything, why?
Maybe you could do a light trim?
Will do
Very red
I think just the angle made it look shaved
Lol
I've missed your body and your warmth and your ass so much
Like the warmth of being inside of you is so nice
Wow. I'm dating a natural artist. That's exciting.
An erotic artist
I like that I figured out how to contract, I like how it feels
Thanks b
Does it feel nice for yourself?
Is it weird if I want you to finger yourself and contract and explain it to me?
Not weird
Ya it feels nice 
I think it would make more sense if
I did it while you were in but not moving
And I can explain it then
It's of course nice when you move 
But also nice when you don't because I just have this really nice feeling of wholeness and filling
Like a crisp apple  pie
Or a cream pie 
Like Auntie Agatha's 4th of July Blueberry Pie
Finger lickin' delicious
That's chicken hunty
🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
after my finger's in you it ain't 
Waiting patiently

Minus the leaves
Sublimation
Transferring my sexual energy through my drawings

I'm so happy to touch you 
I can't wait to 💀 (bone) you
Power and control wheel?
Lol
It would be if not for the fact that he has a point
Why doesn't she tell him she won't do that
Buddy what's u
Up
I'm watching sense8, drinking tea, and eating hot Cheetos lol
What about you?
Well he also says he's worried about her health because she is sick
You could have totally come over but it's too late now
I also just got done doing karaoke because I think I'm so good
What kind of sick is she
When I pick you up
You should be a bit forceful, I'm going to resist your advances
Is sense8 good
I'm gonna take a bath and finish OITNB
Idk I think general fatigue and shittiness. 
When you pick me up
I think you pick me up around 6?
Why will you resist my advances lol?
I thought I was going to lay off on the advances and let you take control
That sounds like a relaxing hour
Sense8 is... Interesting
The first episode is really confusing
They think they have the flu
That'll be fine too
Poor guys 
I heard it was hard to follow at first
How did you hear about the show
Was it because there are LGBTQ characters
Gagaball is some Israeli game. I was sore every day after playing
What the fuck did I just watch. It's so trippy.
Probably more like 630
Alright
Sorry I was working on something
It was discussed in th office
One of the doctors made a trans positive comment regarding it that she tried to make seem general but I'm pretty sure it was meant to me
Hmm 
I thought it was lady gaga related
Is 7 okay
Ok... Why?
I mean that's fine but what's the hold up
I just finished doing dishes
Still need to pack
I'm sorry
Are you bringing your paper bag or do I bring my compact?
Lol what?
Nvm
Here
Hey thanks 
For everything
What's rodcocker from?
What do you mean?
It's from OITNB 
Good night
I filled out a test and it gave me this.... Fuck
Good night
I got a 33 on my ACT without writing...
Holy shit
31 with but I'll retake
I was expecting something below a 30
Lol you side 75% with Hilary Clinton so why don't you just give up right no
Now 
That is fantastic
Holy fuck
You know writing doesn't count into it
Like it doesn't average
So it's a 33
Like that 31 doesn't mean shit
It's a 33!
I knew you would do it
Are you fucking serious
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Yes :)
Wow!
I honestly don't even know what to do
I'm just so happy
I guess I will start by taking that quiz too lol
Watch me get Bernie
You know, I never took the option I chose into consideration
Oops, I meant to put the no above that
With variables such as education
"Most minimum wage jobs are meant to develop experience, not support a family" wtf
I had a dream Arianne's dad was driving me and a few more people around town to commit a crime. Then my second dream was that Elizabeth and I walked around downtown to some art gallery and found a devil painting, because I was showing her the piece that inspired our role play 
I put no for the second one
And the government should never mandate... For the first one
I had a very sad dream
I'll tell you later
I think you and Elizabeth could be friends
Diviya: "what the fucking hell. that is so fucking good... like not sergio good. like Harvard good."
I think so too. I notice that she is always to the side whenever we are in groups and I am always inclined to talk to her. I have always wanted to ask how she got involved with the female religious bunch in her grade and what she thinks about it.
Female religious bunch?
Who is included in that
That is harvard good
But sergio is harvard good
So it's equivalent
I can guess who you will vote for...
The A mountain fireworks we missed 😕
Sara, Helena, Jane, Sabrina, Tala, etc.
Elizabeth is probably the only one out of them to have sex or party. Helena might have done a bit of dirty action and Sara might drink but still, Elizabeth is the unexpected deviant of the group.
I'm going to see about Tufts
Aren't you a Cruzie?
What underwear size are you?
Bradford posted this. 4th of July in Palestine...
Also that night at your house I didn't get upset because you are leaving??? That's what Jennifer told me you told her.
Yeah you did
I think you are forgetting
Holy shit where is that photo from
I did in the bathroom but it's not why I left the bed room
You should see about tufts!
Oh I thought that was what made you all violent
And sad
No I got over the leaving thing before I even left the bathroom lol
I got a 5 on APUSH and Seminar
Martha and Ahmad got a 4 and Nate got a 3 on seminar
Idk what size I am? Small?
I hate Cruz
Tumblr. One of the most anti-American platforms where shit like that is acceptable and lauded.
I need you to get me your exact underwear size
Like the size that flatters you the most
No I meant the fireworks
Lol I'll let you know when I get home
I think my american eagle ones are dium
But I think they are a bit too big?
Right now Diviya and Nate and I are trying to help Diviya get her AP scores
None of the methods we used earlier are working lol
I'm satisfied with Hillary. 
Oh, I'm part of this Tucson group on Facebook. They post a bunch of sunsets and monsoon pics.
Ok cool. We need something a little more... Revealing for you.
Movie time!!!!
Should I watch Her or Brazil tonight?
Her
Lol you have piqued my curiosity
What's up
How was your day
My day was great! I went out for breakfast with a family friend and her son, discovered the in-cave zipline and the appeal of southern comfort food in Louisville via Snapchat, found out some exciting test news and received my first (and more) 5's and 4's on AP exams, read some articles, and watched Sense8
I lit some candles and was finishing up my book until I got distracted by things
I'll probably do some yoga soon
First:
This nail salon in Tucson kept the Hollywood video sign and named the place Hollywood Nails
So proud to know how nifty the residents of my hometown are!
Second:
Major nostalgia.
Third: how was your day? What's up witchu?
Also my mom made amazing falafel and tzatziki only to fail making her own version of Zayna fries.
What did you get on the other APs
Congrats btw
Love that pic 
My day was great
My mentor was out cos her roof was leaking and she was waiting for a repair man
So I shadowed this infectious disease doctor who was working at the lab just for today
He was so cool
:( the fries are the best part
4 on calc which upset me and the others upset me too so I'm just going to be proud about everything else.
Oooh that's cool. What does he usually work on?
My counterargument to Ben's "you're from basis so you can have an intellectual discussion" statement is that I think 'uneducated' people or people from other schools are capable and very much do make acute observations about the world in the way that we do,  only a privileged environment gives one the ability (vocabulary, line of reasoning, etc.) to articulate ideas 
 
 
Diviya's texts with Nate on my phone from 4th of July night
"Even tho they fuck like rabbits"
4 is still great!
Normally he is on call at the hospital 
Whenever a person under 22 comes in for infectious disease 
He doesn't have almost any regular patients
Because infectious diseases can mostly be cured
I disagree
I mean I think we talk about different things due to knowledge differences
It's not like most conversations are about acute observations at all
I think he's being a prick but he's right that the conversations are often different
With the uneducated it's about their lives or celebrities or something 
Love the pics
Safe sexting
In my childhood and even today a lot of things acquired from knowledge are not conversed and almost everything in my house is about the celebrities and the lives. I have had to create this bank of knowledge for my life outside of home, which is strange.
I probably place a lot of value on the human life and the experiences because that was all I ever grew up knowing and that was all my family knew about.
I feel like it's unacceptable for someone to say rude things about someone else's parent
Like idk, I think it's okay for me to criticize my mom and stuff but I don't appreciate it when you say she's a dumbfuck 
That actually bothers me
You used to say things about how you hate your mom and you will never forgive her but I never said anything extreme like that
I remember how confused I was when you said that you were afraid so you had her read you a book to fall asleep months after you said you hated her
And I encouraged you to have a relationship and to move on and forgive
Ok I'm sorry
Didn't know it hurt you
I thought that it would make you feel better, that I sided with you
What have you been up to tonight
I finished OITNB
fed the tortoise
Helped Oscar write a CV
That's it
Wbu
I'm watching sense8 and about to start Her, went to my Boy Scout meeting, currently planning out the party and trying to help KZ access his AP scores but I forgot how :(
I guess I'm meeting him for lunch on Friday at the hospital food court 
Also I need to start my personal statement
Thoughts on the season?
Soso part of the black crew now lol
"They gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one"
Idk if you read the open relationships NYT thing I sent but it sounds awful and my opinion is only furthered by a situation in sense8 where a gay couple is forced to live with a girl for publicity reasons
And she infiltrates every part of their life
Being a home wrecker sounds kinda fun
Are you going to bed soon
Say hi to me when you come by
Let me know when you arrie
You don't need to start it
Don't get dragged into the hysteria by the Diviya group
Don't spend your summer worrying and working for school
Love soso ending 
Hope alex is ok
Wanna see daya's baby go to pornstache's mom
Hope Caputo goes through hell
Yeah I plan on it
Does she know it's for publicity 
WHEN THE WHOLE DEA SHIT HAPPENED WITH DAYA'S BABY I WAS SO PISSED OFF UGH GODDAMNIT THE BABY COULD HAVE HAD BALLET AND ART LESSONS UGHHHH FUCK DUMB PEOPLE WHO THINK FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING
I heard Martha talking about it yesterday and then some other people and I felt guilty for not having anything.
No don't feel guilty
Well I doubt the guard could kill her but also he could frame it and say suicide, who knows
You guys stress each other out
I didn't even start mine until like the second week of school
And it sucked ass
And it was only a paragraph
And this is secret but
I read Martha's and it was a super mess
Like she will need to 100% scrap it
That's what happens when you write things before getting any direction from a college counselor
You have an hour every day allotted to just work on those essays
She knows it's for publicity. She was the one who suggested it. Basically there's an actor and he's gay but she suggests using her as a live-in beard so nobody finds out. The couple has sex and pretend like they are and aren't together in front of her... It's kinda like Reyna and us 
Caputo's a good guy :( 
Him and Figg fucking was hot I think
Yeah I like him
But I always wanna see this mess
Cos he was being a dick
Also*
Lol yeah Martha said that you were hard
How is that Reyna and us
I was, lol
Anyway goodnight
Today I was actually thinking about possible things that she could write about
Like what do the privileged write about
How sudden
Travelling
Like very very sudden
Sorry
goodnight then
??
Hey
Hi
What's up
Why the ??
Are you coming
To scented leaf
No? I didn't think that was for me
We are having a guys night tonight
With Jay
Diviya added you to the chat so I assumed you were part of it too
Oh, no.
Have fun tho
Can you bring 🌿 for the party
Like just for The friend group
Ok nvm actually
I mean this in the most romantic way possible, please
I absolutely love the way I smell after holding you and being inside of you
❤️
Dinner this week?
I also want to see The Overnight
Actually nvm I'm going to be busy this week
All week?
Wtf?
Wolfpack!
And yeah dinner sounds great
Well tonight I was going to see the movie about the girl with cancer,  and Earl and the Dying Girl
Then tomorrow I have to go party shopping all day and then Friday night is the party for close friends
Wolfpack looks soooo awesome. That was my second choice after overnight
Okay, are you also in the mood for Indian?
I want to try May's Counter Chicken & Waffles
I hi
Hi*
I just woke up in the movie theater 
The movie isn't that great
I'm probably going to walk to in n out
What's up
Hey I am just getting home
Party shopping?
Indian is gr8
Party shopping, what?
Mays is also gr8
I'm just alone lol
Like shopping for what for the party
We only need food I think
Ugh it's raining now I can't leave lol
How was your day today?
This morning Diviya's mom took me home and I officially declare that being alone with people's parents is the weirdest thing ever
It was raining with sun out at my house
My day was pretty alright. Didn't really do anything all morning until a lab meeting, which was interesting. 
How was it
What did she say
Yeah I know I'm at the in n out right next to your house
It was like a 30 second rain
Well she told me she could see me in either Boston or New York and she was telling me about all the things to do there and what it was like for her growing up near NY
It was fine but awkward without Diviya to provide comfort
Did you know that I saw and heard Diviya and Nate having sex almost all night
Then when I asked Diviya about it she said they were doing things from the moment lights went off to 3am
I'm at the family friend's house haha
So we switched places 
Wow
I feel less bad about us now
Good for them
I had an amazing time last night
Seriously it was like the best ever for me
I had been dreaming of it all afternoon and evening and it exceeded my fantasies 
AKA you probably noticed how wet I was
I thought you were upset with me last night because you eventually told me to stop
I'm now at Starbucks working on my common app
Also Diviya told me not to repeat this but I think I have the right to?
Last night she told me that you think I get rapey with you sometimes
What do you mean by that
I wasn't upset, I just thought it was too loud and I didn't want to upset Diviya
I think it is frustrating when you get drunk and if I don't have sex with you you tend to get very upset
Which is pretty manipulative
But I am also not very upset by it
If we had switched sides I could have kept going and I wouldn't have had to see shirtless Nate thrusting it into Diviya
I'm surprised you didn't catch any of her moaning 
Or when she got up to check the condom
I don't think it's the sex part, necessarily 
It's more that I just want to be alone with you at some point of the night like every other couple is, and that usually entails sex
I don't believe it has to though and I don't always want it to
I push for alone time early because you are one of the only people who falls asleep early 
It's just weird to me, sleeping together with other people in the same bed
Sorry I'm driving
I will answer in a drc
Sec
Didn't want to leave you hanging
That's awkward
That's alright. Right now I'm having Larissa, KZ, Diviya, Martha, and Nate help with my common app lol
I sleep heavily 
I suppose
Omg sergio stop
Let it go
Wait til the school year
Ok but even if so the way you conduct yourself isn't appropriate
So obviously it's about being gay and my coming out experience and Keizer's response was "I liked it. It pulled on my heartstrings"
I see your motivations but the ends don't justify the means
Oh ok so it's just the first essay
Still 
Waittttt y'all need Jesus to help you cool it
P
Okay well then I'll cool it at this next party 
No! I need mine to be as brilliant as yours
I want to do it with you usually
I just don't want to worry about the consequences if I say no, I want to do it because we both want to? 
Mine took 10 drafts
I started 2 weeks into school with one paragraph
One sucky paragraph
It'll be fine
I can send it to you though, ya?
But wouldn't you want to do it in another room rather than having me stick it in while we are presumably asleep
I don't want mine to take forever though
It will
And when you think it is done
It won't be
I want to get it over with ASAP and just worry about taking my SAT one more time and schoolwork
Schoolwork is almost nothing as a senior 
SAT will be over soon enough
Your only real work is essays
So don't buy into the bullshit that you shouldn't have a summer 
I know you feel unproductive
As compared to them
But this isn't a good means to express that
At least the manager of panera is scheduled to call me tomorrow
I actually feel the opposite of the first statement. I'm going to be taking connolly's critical theory and AP research 
That's a lot of fucking writing
The writing just happened on its own today
It's not the writing
I was writing a poem and then I started writing about common app worthy stuff and BAM!
It's having other people review it
The refining
I think that's where it is overboard
No 
Seriously trust me
They do everything to hold your hand and hand you an A
Literally they are told to
No matter the class (except Ms. k)
But anyway
Thank you for last night again, I felt soooo good but I'm sorry for being a dick
Idk why you're being a hard ass about this. I'm having fun being this open with people and letting them read it.
Keizer says he isn't ready to speak about his sexuality in the form of an essay yet but he was touched and that made me so happy
How were you being a dick?
You were so quiet last night. I felt like it was either silent judgement or you were kinda high
What made me happiest about the entire time was when we intertwined hands during the amazing sex and saying goodbye before you finally left
So not the sex itself but the romantic gestures
I thought it was going to be "but anyway
Goodnight bitch"
Omg Keizer is apologizing to me because he can't write about his sexuality
It's funny how we are expected to show this very vulnerable side of ourselves to our college counselor and some stranger across the country 
Idk you thought I didn't want it I didn't mean to give that impression 
Very kinda 🌿
Lol I know right
I derive some comfort in the idea
I don't know the admissions officer and never will 
Some people meet theirs, I think it's kinda icky 
But anyway
Goodnight bitch
I honestly did not expect you to come last night
Diviya and I were talking about how we missed Nate and then she said he was on his way
Seeing you was a surprise
You're terrible
Absolutely terrible
☺️🐢🍆❤️👬
Goodnight
Are you going to make lemon bars today or tomorrow?
I can?
??
Your first sentence in your essay is grammatical incorrect
Your use of different tenses is inappropriate
And yes I'll make lemon bars
Why are you reading it now oh my god
It's awful
I am on lunch break
And you sent it to me
"Announced her stay" needs to be rephrased
It has the wrong connotations 
I am very critical with essays, lol
Ok also and this is a bigger thing
Anthony liked it but he said I sound very condescending
And like a racist
It makes a bad impression to say you didn't give a shit about your mom. Say you were conflicted. Something. Not apathetic.
Even if you are about to go into it, saying you don't care if someone dies is never good
Colleges will rate your personality based on essays
Like literally numerically rate
She isn't even catholic
Ok anyway sometime we should talk about your essay in person
She was raised a catholic. Converted in her 30s
When it's a more complete draft
Cos I'm gonna be too picky for it to be useful at this point
How is your day
:(
Okay
It already hurt and you weren't even far
You've also never read any of my writing before, I think
My day is alright. Went out to Goodness for breakfast this morning and then went party shopping
Wbu?
Sorry :(
Hahah it's fine it actually wasn't that mean
I just got my uncle to buy us alcohol
Are you able to store?
Yeah
What's up
Actually Veris and I are meeting my uncle tomorrow lol
I just finished cooking and working out party stuff with people. I need to get Diviya a present and get some money.
Wbu? How are you feeling?
I'm feeling pretty good, just headed home
When are we headed out tomorrow
Or when
In general
And also what are you buying
What drinks what quantities
Do you have any drinks at your place
Like 1/2 bottle of rum
So not really
Reyna and Ale are sharing a tent and he is bringing her up
Maybe we can use that up on Friday night?
So we are heading up the mountain on Saturday afternoon but Diviya and I are thinking of a small sleepover on Friday?
Idk. I am giving my uncle $60-$80 and he's just gonna get mike's, beer, vodka, etc.
Actually
Diviya and I want to know if we can smoke
:O
Aight
And I don't have much but sure but
When are you planning to smoke
Because I want to be at whatever events we have, but I think it creates negative energy when we are together and smoking
So maybe if you do it some morning and I go hike, or after I fall asleep or something
We as in you and me?
I smoked at Joseph's...?
Oh! I lied. I gave it up after Joseph's. Not prom.
I was totally fine that night.
That party was my favorite.
But whatever you want, idc
Or I could drive you up and you smoke before that drive up
We wanted to do it tomorrow night
Nvm just forget it
What are your thoughts
You're making this a bigger deal than it has to be. Diviya and Nate and I could come over tomorrow night and just do it in the shower and it's not a problem.
It is a problem though
I don't want it done at my house...
How did sleepover become sleepover at my house?
Why is it a problem
Your house is a suggestion, I didn't say it had to be
Maybe you can drop it off at Diviya's
Tomorrow night
I'll think about it
No, forget about it. It's not happening.
Do gay couples with a trans person actually do that?
I knew the first man to get pregnant thing was a huge deal
Idk why trans people never bothered me, even with my upbringing
Probably because All my life I felt like everything the church said about sexuality was wrong, and that extended to gender too? Idk
Anyway, I'm sorry if I upset you
Bass lesson tonight?
Sometimes they do
He wasn't at all the first
He just drew a lot of publicity to himself
Idk it seemed like they did bother you?
No I was just showering
And sorry, honestly my logic was that
I'm ok with giving it to you to do, but not if as a result I won't join you guys the sleepover 
Do you want me to jack off tonight or no
was I ever transphobic to you? What did I say?
I mean I guess the concept was foreign but the actuality of it made it clear
What are you doing tonight
Or tomorrow night
Don't jack
Tonight I am chillin at home bc I am tired but we could hang out if you want
You didn't say anything but I thought you indicated that you used to be transphobic
I love the video
LOVE
Jen and Joseph aren't coming btw
Nvm, I figured you would be tired this week so I went out anyway haha
While I was driving I had this crazy energy exchange with some guy next to me and we kept looking away and glancing
I swear it was Rosinbum
Or maybe I'm missing him so much that I'm projecting his face onto other people
It had to be him
I literally did not know what transgender was until I met you, and when Shawn said that thing I was hurt
I got Curt to come camping with us hahah
The West Bank snapchat story was surprising
I want to make this picture the party cover for Facebook
Yes do it
Love your use of "energy exchange@
"
I hate that snapchat felt obligated to do West Bank the day after Israel. That's political.
:( 
Omg city
Curt*
I might go to all the SOS shows
Yeah I felt the same way about it. Snapchat got a lot of shit for only doing Israel though.
Why :( ?
And why is Curt an omg?
Maybe him and Leo can finally get their sexual frustrations resolved 
I think the next time you reply you're going to be going to sleep
The night we were at Diviya's I obviously didn't want to get blue balls so I jerked off on my own and I came all over my chest
It was a bunch
They are in 2 weeks? 3?
:( for Joseph
Just a surprise
I noticed you jerkin lol
Any hope for a pic?
Also who did you go out with this week
July 22-24th
Well Anthony and I did this live college help thing and he was helping me with common app. exercises and giving me tips and stuff
We are gonna meet up at sparkroot
Aside from that just Diviya and Alex (tufts kid)
Tomorrow I'm gonna see Veris, Reyna, and KZ
You too because you told me to let you know when I got to UMC
He finally chose a major!!!!!
English.
KZ and I are gonna hit the farmer's market
Anyyyyywaaaaaaay
Ya do you have a general timeframe for tomorrow?
I don't get to check my phone a lot while working
What a great major...
#liberalarts
I'm meeting him at 11:50ish
I'm also gonna be there at 7:30 in the morning lol
Basically lol
"Work at McDonald's"
"'Write'"
"Teach English"
At least he can edit my essays lol
Well I don't come in until 9 SOOO
Why 7:30?
Good for him
Good night
You are so difficult
#lovemeorleaveme
Hahahahah
#butpleasethefirstoption
#ficklebitch
#picklebitch
#fucklefickle
Sorry you didn't get pickle tonight
I was in the love me mood
I dare to define lovemaking as more than penis
Penis + balls
Right right
That's TRUE lovemaking
Anyway, see ya 
Just stick it all in
Goodnight
And wiggle dat
Good night
730 because my mom has an appointment and then she is taking me to cartel
Ah I forgot what a gay bitch anthem Gaga's Donatella is
Are you driving people up the mountain?
Wednesday Lost in Translation 7:30pm is happening 
Prolly on driving 
Omg literally all the kids at the Tucson village farm
I'm getting breakfast at the UMC cafeteria
Where did you find that??
That's so funny 
What campsite are we going to
Found on reddit
I thought it was hilarious
How is breakfast
I don't remember. I asked Diviya the same question earlier this morning.
Haven't had it yet. Headed there now. Then I'm going up to meet Martha to see microscopes lol.
Oh cool!
Nothing that cool in my lab
Hey hey hey
Are you still here
I just got word that my mentor is gonna be late
Yeah I am haha
Where u at b
Sorry b
❤️❤️❤️
Hahaha no problem, wanted to hug you goodbye
Can you get coke on your way home
I'm in love with the coco
Is that what you mean
🌷🌿🌵
👖👖👖
Plants with pants
Do you mean coca cola
Yeah I do lol. Pack your stuff and meet us at Diviya's
When
7
Ok
More like 730
Diviya is taking so long
Well where are you
I'm leaving the house already
I'm at my house and Diviya is coming to pick me up rn
Nobody is at her place
I'm gonna intercept you guys
Why?
You're just gonna waste gas
I'm gonna call you one Zev
Sec
Diviya just called and a few things:
1) her mom was upset that we had sex in her bathtub but I clarified and said it was just a bath
2) Diviya thinks it's weird that you just dropped me off at home and we're not together right now? Lol
3) can you pick up alcohol from Diviya's house to store. Otherwise her mom will throw it away
1) good, hope she isn't mad now
2) Ya that's weird, we literally spent days together
3) can I do it tomorrow
What's up
Dawg
Not too mad now. There is always something to be mad about when it comes to her, hahah.
I think she only said that because her and Nate are still together right now
Mmmmmm let me see. Her mom is upset about housing it and Nate doesn't want to take it.
I ate a burger, chicken salad, chips, and drank some tea.
Doing some laundry now and unpacking. Wbu?
On Wednesday (my birthday) the loft is playing lost in translation
Also we should definitely go out to eat
Probably going to read soon
Curt texted me and he's interested in coming to coffee nights... Lol
Hi
Where did you eat all that
I am watching house of cards
I like curt!
Lost in translation sounds great
All from home haha
I thought you gave up on HOC? If I stop watching a show and then attempt to continue a month later I have to restart the entire season.
Lol why do you like curt? Probably because he got shirtless
Jk jk. He's alright.
When someone asked what I was reading I showed them the cover of the book, and there is an "Oprah's Book Club" label on the cover. Then someone said "oh, it's one of THOSE books." Is there some connotation???
Then someone else said they expected me to read a book like that lol
Is that Martha
Nah I can keep up well
Idk its a book for housewives 
Those books are
HOC is brilliant
I have met people like those in HOC
and I want to understand them
That's why I watch it. It's educational
I once had a babysitter from Puerto Rico who told me that if I ate fruit after 6pm I would get fat.
Yeah it's Martha lol on Halloween 
It's young adult fiction...
Exactly
Twilight, housewives. 
They could probably help you for lobbying. Aside from that idk why one would maintain contact with a person like that.
 
OMG kyrie posted on fb
Nice photos
Not as friends
As people who surround me
Gotta know how to deal b
Diviya's mom threw them out :(
Might actually cry
What the fuck
Fuck
To where
I'm gonna cry
Ah yes, this is the real problem
THEY WANT OUR BUSINESS, AIMEE!! How did we not figure this out sooner
Idk :( that is soooo upsetting
Nate didn't want to take it
He literally could have taken it and called you to see if he could drop it off
I turned some dollar box of pasta roni into gourmet shit with chili powder and vegetables
Why don't you like her post...? It's so touching.
Show her that you, as a gay, love her too.
"We thought Thurman ova there havin' a seizure, turns out he just excited about nature." -GhettoHikes
This sounds like Nate more than her mom than...
Maybe I'll like it! :)
I got some gourmet pasta from the freezer
Thx Amy's
Like ghetto hikes?
I don't understand y'all's fear of carrying substances. I'd rather be caught carrying alcohol than weed.
Also what is the chance of getting pulled over and the cop seeing it
I'm not going to place it on my passenger seat
When I drive you bet I'm going to be storing
So afraid and costing us $30 of liquor smh.
WHO THROWS IT AWAY
Check your privilege
At least I understand the work necessary to make the gourmet meal
The blood, sweat, and tears
How it feels to plant the tomato seed in the ground to make your pasta sauce
It's like that ghetto girl from Grand Canyon 
Ghetto hikes is some funny shit
And by I, I mostly mean my ancestors... Or my cousins and uncles and aunts and grandparents 
What have you been up to tonight
Oh my god more policeeeeeeeee
My dad does the tomato part
So actually I'm closer to the struggle
Why police again
I have been watching house of cards, long bath
Shaved the whole abdomen
It's all smooth n shit
I guess nothing could happen with the cops
You are right
Bringing it into my house with all the sloshing noise is another story 
You need to open the snap
Lol your dad just interacts with the xicans. He doesn't actually grow himself unless you count your domestic garden
Police over some stupid glasses and ex-dad's girlfriend cussing grandpa out and whatever
Being home is very stressful
I don't understand the feeling when people say that school is the most stressful part of their lives
I was going to ask for a pic but I can wait :P
Also Richie steals clothes from my closet and then wears them to his dad's house and I never see them again
Exactly. I will probably store mine in the attic.
Right now Alex and I are home alone while grandpa and mom are over at ex-dad's house to handle police, as members of both parties curse and scream at each other
Omg ew
God I didn't know kids could have moobs that young 
Is he gonna get diabetes
He used to grow?
Are they nice clothes
The act of going to school is never stressful for me
It's the knowledge that going to school may entail more work at home
You never know when an assignment from hell is headed your way
The doctor is worried Richie will get diabetes and I'm sure Alex is next. Portion control and calories are foreign practices in my family. 
*regulating calorie intake
I mean that your dad doesn't grow the tomatoes, unless you count him tending the garden at your place
Regardless, the clothes are clothes and they are my clothes, but yes. He takes nice clothes that I regularly wear and it pisses me off.
I find peace in working on assignments because it gives me an excuse to detach myself from the situation at home
I need places to go and things to do and people to talk to so I am distracted from my family, so I don't drown here
Thus, I started reading Gone Girl about 30 minutes ago :)
But I am saying he did grow tomatoes, like legit grow them
For years in Israel
:(
That's so sad
Is the book any good
Tell him no girls like fatties
Except some fat girls
Anyway good night
Goodnight
Sup
Yooo
I am eating quinoa with tomatoes and onions and bell peppers and some meatless chicken strips (?). Still tastes great.
Wbu? How's your day going
I've also decided I need to do more for Hispanic pride
Keizer says I am a 6 out of 10
My quinoa tastes like an organic chocolate rice crispy treat
Any interesting developments in your life or Oscar's life 
Send quinoa recipe?
His aunt died so he is sad. And guilty that right before she died he lied to his parents and went out to score a bj on grindr
My day has been stressful. The task I am doing cannot be screwed up
Like they would kill me
How do you feel about what Keizer said
Haha yeah so I use one serving of the Ancient Harvest inca red quinoa. Boil it in a small pot of water and add onions, yellow and red bell peppers, and tomatoes. On a skillet I fried some little veggie chicken strips, but obviously you can add whatever else you want. It's basic.
I also had some edamame on the side
That's terrible! :(
I hope he feels better this week
One time I missed my brother's birthday so I could give Shawn a bj
What is the task you are doing? Hopefully you can complete it successfully 😊
I think a 6 is kinda low. He says that I'm cute more than anything, which I kinda agree with.
I'm supposed to go swimming tonight but the weather decided to foil my plans
Also sorry, I just got back from a walk so I couldn't reply
How does that end up tasting like chocolate
I had to set up these plates of DNA for the sequencer
But you can't tell if they are full
And they are very large grids so it gets confusing and headache-y
In what context did Keizer say that
:(
I wish you could swim. 
Who were you gonna go with
Lol I ran into Keizer at the hospital and he totally ignored me. I was like "Hey!" And he was like "hi......" And turned away
I have you tell you a secret
Also hi bb boy, just woke up from a nap
During the camping trip, after the group split up and stopped playing truth or dare, KZ and curt went back to the tent and talked for a while. Curt was telling KZ he was really horny and then KZ said, "well if Reyna can't give you a bj I can give you one..." but Curt declined
Did you end up finishing? Do you have to do the KEYS presentation too?
KZ and I were up last night talking about attractiveness and it just came up
He likes the structure of my face and my smile, lol
I was going to swim with some of the older scouts
What's your plan tonight?
That must have created awkwardness
I am not in KEYS or SIMI so no
I am gonna make indian food tonight
I promised the lab
That I would try
I cannot imagine that image
What a cute dancer
What's your plan tonight
I might go to black crown at 8, idk yet
Wbu?
How demanding is Indian food
Really fucking demanding
I'll come to black crown whenever I finish with the food
Prolly 8:30
I'm gonna stay the night with older Boy Scouts
But I'm going to black crown first
Don't believe in objectification my ass
Literally
Lol well it's josh so I don't have to do much explaining
:)
I mean to some degree I do stand by what I said
What Indian food are you making?
Yes the dancer is so cute! Whenever I'm upset I watch that video and I feel better
I'm actually excited to see you either today or Wednesday
I am making chicken curry and rice
I don't think I'm gonna make it tonight :(
My meal is barely started
That sounds awesome! Are you up for Indian on Wednesday?
That's fine 😘 have fun cooking and good luck, habibi
add you okay if Boy Scout boy is there?
No....
You can't sleep over with him that's fucked up
Yes indian then sounds great
I don't think he's staying the night actually
Also there are like 5 people
U and Reyna r cute
Ok whatever you feel is safe
❤️❤️❤️
How is your food?
It sucked, more or less
So much effort
Oh well
Lessons will hopefully be learned
How has your evening been
awww I'm sorry :(
I would still eat it haha
I don't have high standards for food
My evening was great! Went swimming and saw Reyna and now I'm playing some racing game haha
I hope yours is nice
It's weird that I miss you even though I saw you yesterday 
My dinner is pizza
Awe
Awwew
Awwww*
What a nice dinner...
Goodnight and I hope to see you soon :)
Goodnight my boy 😘👬💖
It rained a bunch
Reyna met this guy from the Internet and now we are at his house
He's super rich
I can literally see all of Tucson from his roof
His backyard is on the mountain
"From the Internet"
?
Literally from some tinder thing
Ah tinder...
Is she on the prowl for the 🍆?
Pic of him?
Face
Well not tinder exactly but similar.
What then?
He has a bar in his house...
That's normal
Not sarcasm
Ok but he is like actually super super rich
Is the cute
He
Yeah kinda
Aka no
Just needs a better haircut
We just shot guns in his backyard
Sup
Real guns?
We are showing rich boy Arab music
He has his hands around Reyna's waist...
What's up with you?
Yeah real guns hahah
He handcuffed us both to this pole in his room
How did the Indian food do among the people in the lab
What's up
Like what have you been up to tonight
Sorry I've been at family friends house
I hated it, but it got better overnight, they said it was a good first try and gave me tips 
How is it going over there
I'm watching Wolfpack right now
I'm sorry I couldn't reply
I hope yiur gaining a good night
*houre having
I just got home
How is the movie
It's great and pretty funny
Reyna and her boy are cuddling up on the couch
 Best documentary ending ever!!!!!
Gonna see Wolfpack alone I guess :(
I can go see it again if you want
Hopefully you having good times in love and miss you 
Happy birthday!
❤️❤️❤️
🐢🐢🐢
Ahh gracias señor
Have q great day!
What's the plan tonight
Mmmm I'll see if people want to go out for dinner
Is that cool?
You don't wanna go just us? I'm cool with whatever
We can just do something alone
Do you want to just do dinner or do you want to also see a movie?
We can go alone
Whatever you want
You know actually
It would be nice to go out with the people today since they are all riled up
You and I can have a picnic and I'll give you your presents alone tomorrow or on the weekend or somethin?
Alright cool! Let's go out tonight. Caruso's
What time?
❤️excited
I'm thinking 8
Ok also please do not repeat this at all I swear
There's a party at Elliot's tomorrow
But it's super super low key as in don't mention it to anyone, including Reyna
Why am I invited to it in that case?
Diviya told me to invite you
Lol ok
Thx doc
Div
Basically Elliot doesn't want Reyna there :(
So it's not super low key
It's just no Reyna
He wants it small and without Reyna
She already knows but I wouldn't bring it up again
K
How has your bday been
So good. I went to blue willow for breakfast and got Diviya her gift. I took a nap. Then I met Jen at the mall to see Ted 2 and Bella came after the movie to eat with us and say happy birthday.
How was your day?
My day was ok, I didn't do much, and one in the girls in the lab got on my nerves because she has the same conversation and same question with everyone all the time and she keeps asking if she should go to GCU and they all say no and yet she hasn't gotten the hint. It's like she won't stop until some fool says yes.
/rant
What are you going to order to eat
Nvm
Do you wanna get dinner now
I want real food
Or go to Bookman's or something
I need to get Diviya's gift since she is coming today
Answer bish
Hi sorry just got out of shower
Well my family is doing cake now (ughhh) and right after I'm doing black crown. Do you want me to let you know if I finish early?
We could probably eat at 7::30?
7:15
Lol that whole thing is so annoying. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. 
Why can't she just make the decision on her own
Like figure out what she wants. She doesn't need to consult every random person she meets.
I could say we both picked out her gift together
I got her a clutch, some cute plate about drinking, and the Cancer magnet 
You can get a funny card
I'll bring a pen
I'll pay for 50% + card then
How much was it
You get the card and a gift bag
Lifesaver omg
No
I get 50% + that
Lol it was $26 I'm not having you pay for it
I am having me pay for it
It's pointless saying no at this point hahah
Thank you :)
Make sure whatever you get is funny to fit the theme. I've got gift wrap.
Also my theme for her gifts is blue
NSFW NSFW NSFW
Photo album of the guy I was looking for a while back
You will probably like the final ones
I think they look a lot like us, in a way
I'm actually done with cake now lol
The final entry photos seriously look like us
Like when the brown is inside
 
 
Why are you on Josh's mom's fb
I like the final ones
That's not even weird
You da bae that I think about all day 💖
Your fountain makes my mouth go insane 💕
Can't compare to how I be droolin' ova ya always 👬
It's the poussey that always be callin' out my name 🌷
Just some poetry I've been working on for my Tufts supplement
Lol ok just kidding
No I ❤️it
So I hope you aren't kidding
Send 
Except put my name at the end so they accept you cos I rub off on you ;)
Hahaha perks of dating someone who got into all 13 schools
Billings thought so highly of me, literally
Like when she found out I was dating you she seemed almost proud
Omg when Reyna was telling me how she wanted to have sex with Ale I said, "Reyna, you need to do that. That would be, like, your biggest accomplishment"
But I meant sex accomplishment
The poem is a play on modern love in this age of heavy sexual activities among underage children
"I'm technically 14/13, I got into NAU without submitting the application"
I think she was just surprised that people like me manage to find people desperate enough
To bang even our disturbed bodies
#youngshakespeare 
#shakespeareintherough
Lol so offensive
South side people be thinkin' that shit right there some Shakespearean type shit
Growing up with ghetto people makes imitating them so convenient
All I have to do is recall my childhood vocab
Did you talk that way
Lol is that 14/13 thing an actual quote 
No but this girl Esmeralda and some skater boy Jessie did 
"Did you speak in such colloquialisms? *gasp*"
Can't imagine Martha on miracle mile
Mm no but I thought about saying that at the time
She could be an empowered feminist hooker
Who then falls into drugs
And becomes a normal hooker
That could be a film
The deception of feminism
Privileged white feminist succumbs to the subjugation of women in prostitution 
Aimee that's like really good
The power is just too much
#conservativepropaganda
The money makes it impossible to leave
Lol sundance attendees would overlook that to analyze the number of steps she took because everything has meaning
My pussy is still wet from the rain 😿😹
"Wow, that scene where she steps with her left foot first. Genius. Not the right foot because she's making the wrong decision"
I almost almost sent to Caleb
Yap
Lol you could have said "what girls with no bio background think happens when they get wet"
*people with pussy
Remember that lol
More like frigid girls who don't get turned on
But thank god you didn't need to clarify
Omg 
What if you could only have sex when it rained
Like we had to coordinate times to have sexy 
*sex
Portland would be the best place by an even bigger margin
I would wait by the UA and whenever monsoon hit you would call me up to meet in the bathroom
No but like only you
Exclusively you
Public bathroom sex sounds hot
That's like me in the gym
I would totally do that
Sometimes I wish places were available for rent
But his dick is soooooo big 
That type of penis is actually the nicest
IMO
It's pretty
Too bad the guy is like 56
And gross in the face
Pic?
Public bathroom sex is so fun because you have to hold yourself up over me while I'm sitting on the toilet
Seats down of course
 
My JO material
 Lol
Thx b
Hot stuff
Did you just jerk it
In progress
Omg in the overnight the guy's dick is so small that the couple has to jerk off each time they want to finish
Hahahahha
That's not really realistic
I don't think
Goodnight b :)))
You are my little peach 🍑 #hornypetnames
Goodnight <3
Sup
Wtf okay so Reyna and I are at the gym right now and we just finished our workout
And some guy came up as we were doing our cool down stretches and started talking
One thing led to another
And now he's showing Reyna some "private" stretches that he didn't want me to see
I'm just sitting here on my yoga mat...
Reyna's whoring it up Thai week
This
The guy is like 40
Oh....
Wtf
Where are you
YMCA
Ohhhh
What's the plan
2nite
B?
Hey I have to pick up alcohol from my uncle
Would you come with me to pick up?
When
At 6:30 or 7? Whenever pretty much
K. Pick you up from YMCA?
No I'm home now
I'll be there around 6:50 if that's ok
Yeah that's okay. Can we take Reyna home on our way? It's on our way kinda
Ok sure but
$3 gas or something? That's really really out of the way
And not kinda on our way
Yeah $3 gas
On my way
Okay cool!
Here
???
Ok we are getting it now
Great
Sup
Sup
Sup 
Conner about us: fucking basis kids
Did Oscar say anything about last night?
He was still sad about the criticism
But other than that no nothing stood out. 
How was your day
Not that this is scandalous or anything, and I actually forgot about it, but when I was trying to shake off my high and it was just me, Oscar, and Nate, I rested my head on Oscar's lap for a while because my head hurt
But then Nathaniel started talking to me and idk what happened but I guess I moved
My day was lame
I basically slept all day and then watched half of Mr. Nobody
I want to see a movie tonight or go do something so I'll see
How was your day?
I did not enjoy that movie
Yeah that sounds grea
T
My day was chill. I was soooo tired. Nothing special. 
Magic Mike XXL 7:25?
Actually
Thinking about it
You're gonna sleep now
I'm really tired, I would fall asleep in a movie
2 ideas
1. Do something else
2. We go see a movie later tonight after I take a nap
Kk go to sleep
What do you prefer
I don't want you tired, period. Your sleep comes first haha.
I woke up at noon today.
Alright. Tomorrow then?
Kk
Aren't we doing picnic on Sunday though? Wouldn't it be better to do a movie then
Go to sleep and let me know whenever
Hope you're not upset
Sunday? I thought saturday.
Sunday doesn't work for me unless it is before 1
I'm not upset, don't worry
Good night for now
Mmmm well.. 
Idk
What's going on Sunday?
Probably next weekend then
:(((
If not the picnic then maybe we can just meet up
Sunday morning
Did you nap lol?
Briefly.
I am driving around town alone
Until my movie starts haha
I'm sorry :( ask your mom to knock you out
We can do breakfast
I went to bookman's
Ok!
Where 
Are you having fun
Lol why Bookmans?
Maybe some homey cafe where you can get eggs and toast and fruit for $3
Yeah I am living the dream now that I have an AUX cord
My movie's at 10 at the loft
Reyna might come. She's not sure yet.
Oscar bleeding for three days sounds almost biblical
They look like a bunch of moms hitting the club lmfao
LOL THEY DO
Yeah that sounds good
It does sound biblical. I actually kinda wanna read the bible for cultural insight
For that same reason I went to bookman's;
I bought a book for nostalgia (Little house on the Prairie), and another called 1491, about what was going on in the new world right before Columbus, with a sequel called 1493 
I have 1491
It's on my desk
Woah
I just randomly chose it more or less 
And on the way out of my neighborhood I saw a family playing catch and so I chatted them up and I'll probably head over there sometime
Charles Mann was always highly suggested by Rosinbum so I figured why not
You need a lot of historical context about what happened before 1491 to actually understand the book
I was like.... Ummmmm?
I consider myself versed enough...
That's awesome! That sounds like the biggest nostalgia score right there.
None of us grew up reading Little House...
Honestly reading it now
I hated reading the bible
It is clear that I liked it because I liked to live vicariously and know the practical ins and outs of people's lives in other places and times
Basically read Revelations and you'll be scared for life
Beyond that it's a simplistic book
Maybe a bit of a thesis on american culture
That's what Christy said!
Old Testament only tho buddy
The Old Testament is fucking boring and God is just angry all the damn time
The New Testament is where compassion appears
That's why I'm a jew and you aren't
I want to read Uncle Tom's cabin. I've read excerpts and it was excellent.
I strive to be like god, instead of Jesus. Power not compassion muahahahahaha.
Doooo eet
Thesis on political sentimentalism in terms of abolition and slavery: my favorite thing
Lol when you see young queers
Sentimentalism?
Ya so the idea is that authors publish controversial materials that evoke fear or other emotions, that way people do something and get political with it
You can have power but nobody to share it with if you show no compassion :(
You're going to be alone your whole life
Lol where are the young queers
Where dey at
Seriously, the only book worth reading is Revelations.
Omg the ASU MUN guy from Mexico who messaged me for a while after the conference came out On Facebook
Anyway
Good night
Hi sorry I fell asleep
The young queers at Bookman's
A girl maybe 13, horrible short hair, and a rainbow strap on her messenger bag
And a person of indeterminate gender, probably 15 or 16, chatting to a guy of 17 or so. 
I could do today but I said no because I wouldn't be able to cook food in such short notice
Boyyy
Do you know enough of this Greece business to explain it to me?
Reminded me of you ;)
Your phone always dies I don't understand
It's not dead, I don't have service. The reason I couldn't go today is that we went on a day trip to some lake. But it's thundering so we are on the way back
Would you workout with me?
Ok nvm I'll ttyl
It's not dead, I don't have service. The reason I couldn't go today is that we went on a day trip to some lake. But it's thundering so we are on the way back
What's up? I'll be home in about an hour
season 5, wow haven't even heard of it
Yes I can give you the Greece run down
I read an article last week
Working out now
Hey boy
I'm burning right now 💪
What were you gonna do at the lake? Which lake?
Lol the prairie joke was that it's the Little HO on the Prairie. Basically me if I lived in the south.
Greece rundown, go!
How are you doing?
I thought you said you could do today but not Sunday?
It's called Parker canyon lake
We were gonna chill and picnic and maybe canoe idk
Oh...
Greece I'll tell you in person
My legs hurt and my ears do too because my parents policed my driving hardcore
I could do this evening
Could have done
I'm sorry :( since you're such a good driver I couldn't imagine what they would say if anyone else drove Hahahaha
So then no 'birthday' dinner today?
If you're tired we can do tomorrow
Yes that is better
I'm not sure what my plans are for the evening but anyway I don't have time to make food before the sunset
Ohhh okay. See, I thought there was going to be an actual dinner and then a picnic.
Two separate things
Birthday dinner can be picnic
Oh
Yes then dinner tomorrow
Better to have a picnic when I have more time
Are you going to come to the essay meeting tonight?
What's that?
Who is doing that
Diviya and I
It was just about my class application essays and her essays for whatever
Maybe not your thing
She says if I come then Nate can come but he hasn't even started on his essays yet
Also I love the girl logic, don't you?
As long as it is productive
I say go
I can't work on essays during class time
What do you mean
How dare you
Whenever I'm given class time to work on an essay that's due in a month or so I can't do it. My best work is done when I'm alone, and other people can review it in person.
I wouldn't be productive at all
I still think it's super funny how you said "blah blah blah, period." to me once and I thought you were making a period joke
Ah gotcha
I am somewhat that way too
It depends how motivated I am but I often cannot work in class
I could for college counseling because I had a clear goal of 3 essays a week 
Coffee and reading tonight?
A quiet evening
Or tea rather
Diviya and I rescheduled 
Okay sure!
Sorry I'm eating, just a sec
My mom scolded me for putting non-organic ketchup on my brother's fish...
My mouth dropped when I saw the 3 essays a week thing btw
Short essays
And sometimes one of them was just a revision
It's not a matter of motivation for me but it's that I'm not creative 
Literally that's what it had to be
I had like 30+ to write
And about 10 weeks
Im going to see a movie soon but where should we meet up after
From early October to mid December
Ok when
Lol @ the ketchup 
8?
Alright!
I take that back I only had 14 essays
But I did 2-3 drafts for each
So it was 3 essays or revisions thereof per week
That's some Rachel Dolezal shit right there
Which one looks better?
I think Obama looks a bit like a lesbian 
Or something. It's just disconcerting
I was just about to say Obama looks hotter
Romney looks like the lesbian
I wish I was more adept at photoshop
So I could do this to you
Hey sorry I was driving
More adept?
You need to know how to use a mouse first, honey
Jk. I've been thinking about who would be a good candidate to do a face swap with me
You and Demi Lovato lol
Why the fuck does seven cups close so goddamn early
If I worked there I would work two hours overtime and then show the owners how much more money they would have made if they did that long ago
Invite all the black crown kids
What's our plan tonight bb boy
Is the joke the content or the fact that she misspelled "femininity"?
I know boy it sucks
8?
It was the content
Basically she's upset because she wanted to have dinner with Nate
But he's doing some boy thing and now she wants to do more girl things
She bailed on me for him
And then he bailed on her
And I bailed on the boys for her...
Well the thing is
Well we have our tea night
So she can deal 
He was gonna do dinner but she got upset that we don't do girl things so she let him go
Wtf
Okay I actually understand her frustration 
?
Sergio this is our night?
Lol I know I'm not talking about tonight 
I'm saying in general
There's the straight boys but where is the girl group
Who is in the girl group
Nobody knows :O
All the girls in our grade suck
You got the lucky bitches who want to go to raves and to the beach
That cos y'all backstab each other
Constantly
My eyes
Ow
He looks like a centaur
How I wish you would watch house of cards :(
He looks like your retarded fish
What I've come to realize is that if I were to run for political office, at this point I am already screwed by the records I have created of my behavior and manner
I understand Joseph
Serious public office that is
At first I thought the house of cards and retarded fish comments were linked, lol
You're going to explain to me when I see you
Where are you
Mmmmm well I'm home now
Where should I be?
Oh I'm picking you up??
Ok I'm on my way then
Lol it was never clear
Here
Kk
 
Tyler West aka kid Jakob tried to get me with
Oh...
He looks 30!
lol you say that like it's a redeeming quality bc I'm into dads
Breakfast tomorrow or nah?
Also idk why you hated Mr. Nobody so much because I love it
Totally
Where? What time?
I honestly don't remember it too muchc
But I know I felt it tried too hard. I like the more intuitive sci fi movie 
There's Biscuits Country Cafe right next to the gaslight theater. We could also do a Brueggers (maybe the one on Broadway by your house) or an iHOP or Good Egg
I get a free bagel with cream cheese from Brueggers because of my birthday lol
9 sounds okay?
It feels more like a dramatic romance movie than a sci fi film tbh. The sci fi comes with the few glimpses of his future life.
Sure let's decide in the morning
Probably more like 9:30 but I'll try and see when I get up
All breakfast sounds so appetizing right now
Ya
Okay, perfect
🌚
🌚
I'm awake btw hahah
Good morning
Hey
I'll pick you up at 9:30?
Alrighty let me ask my mom
She say yaaaa :D
Gr8
Maybe more like 9:40 sorry b
That's all good in the hood
Here
Hi
I was literally just thinking about texting you
That's so weird
Like 30 seconds ago
I made myself a veggie masala burger (tastes like Indian food in a patty) with a lettuce bun. It was soooo good.
How's your family shindig?
Also you probs heard my savers interview news!!!!!!
Where did you get a masala burger?
It was fun!
And yes congratulations
What did the application involve
Trader Joes!
It's already over? What did you guys eat
I submitted the application a while ago. There was some logic and math quiz lol. When I showed up to donate clothes I asked about my application and two people talked to me for a while and they set me up for an interview.
What are you up to now
Mom's having me drive alone right now lol
The whole "clearly male but makeup" really appeals to me
We are whatever. I mostly had gifs
Figs
The oldest kid (rising sophomore) talked about how flowing wells had a football game where they threw flour for school pride (idk) but someone laced it with ecstasy and a ton of people got high from inhalation lol
Where you going
I'm taking a bath. Prolly gonna read 1491
Was the math hard
I've always wanted to work on my eyebrows and eyelids with some bomb eyeliner or eyeshadow. I think I'll do that this week when I go visit Madeleine or maybe have Reyna help me.
He looks great in the first pic
Hahahahahahah what the fuck
Oh my god
That's the craziest shit I ever heard why am I not invited to these events
I need to go to a flowing wells football game
Also throwing flour is very normal. at the UA graduation the kids throw tortillas, hahah.
I drove to a few fast food places to get stuff for the family but I didn't get anything
Like for myself 
The math was a bitch, but only because there are like 60 questions that you need to answer in 5 minutes. You don't need to answer them all but I got nervous.
Crazy shit
I wonder why that is considered necessary at savers
UGHHHHH
I'm so pissed off Aimee I'm sorry
?
I just hate how immature my family is and how divorced parents act
Like I wish you understood
I always want to cry whenever they interact because I can't understand how two people can be so hostile towards each other
Every interaction is destructive
And like my grandpa went to dad's car (because he was picking Alex up) and asked for some bowl back that Alex accidentally left with and took to his dad's place, but then his dad said "don't talk to me unless it's in court" 
I want to punch a wall
Everyone is a fucking idiot
It gets to you after a while
It doesn't sound like something that should be irritating but it fucking is
Where and when did this enmity originate
It's been going on between parents since 6th grade but between me and dad since 4th?
Many years
But this level
This level since 10th
What was it before then?
Before then he didn't have a girlfriend lol but now she cusses my mom and grandpa out and he is always obligated to defend her because SO's are always right
I'll read your Beijing article soon, sorry
Lol I doubt companies even assess those personality tests or any test, for that matter
Apparently there was a massive storm south of Shanghai and the Internet was down
That's why Jenny couldn't talk to me
I have to tell you about the people at savers when I see you and you need to tell me about Greece
That sounds crazy! I feel like I vaguely might have heard about that...
For sure. Any idea when?
Are we going to that guy's house this week
Sergio I feel wonderful
I started a load of laundry that was much needed
I found your sweatpants
And put your other clothes in the washer
I cleaned my room
I messaged Sweeney as I have been putting off doing for weeks
And I messaged Doug back
And I opened all the snapchats
And nothing is weighing on my mind
No to-do list forever delayed
Now all I have to do is read a few articles I have saved
You waited that long to wash the vomit clothes... Lol.
That's great!! Although it's strange to me that those things don't get done immediately. For me those are always priorities, except messaging people back.
I do message important people back immediately though, so the Sweeney thing would have been a priority.
I'm happy for you
I would prefer doing dinner and going to his house tomorrow.
Tuesday is cool too but then we couldn't see the sunset because I have to volunteer in the evening
Madeleine says I was rude to her at Elliot's party and she's upset with me but I actually don't remember anything :(
Yes she told me that
I forgot to tell you
Right now I'm reading Gone Girl while watching Lifetime. Literally a housewife.
????
She didn't message me in the first place
Okay
I just had wanted to message her
Sorry it was in the KEYS research exhibition
I couldn't message you for hours afterwards 
Yeah lol I waited cos I didn't have a time that my parents weren't all around
What was Madeleine mad about precisely?
She just told me you were insensitive, I think regarding appearance
HELLO
I was wondering why you didn't text me back and then I realized I didn't reply
It's called GIF Keyboard 
What's up
Also I was very irritated and idk why
So I'm gonna hang out with Reyna and will during the day and you'll meet up with us?
What restaurant do you want to go to
Why did you become so irritated
Your birthday your choice
Yeah sounds good
Idk I've been irritated for the past hour
I was at the house of the lady who almost died and it was depressing as fuck
I excused myself to get a bean burrito from that xican place down the street
Once I drove and finished the burrito I felt great
aning I feel fine now
Sorry though
What a progressive comic for 2 years ago, the restaurant one. Hahaha
Do you think the female population limit in China will be annulled because of this new governmental ambition?
Lol no
I'm glad you feel better
Though
It's weird that we are gonna meet will
He's so boring
He has the personality of an Adidas flip flop
He asked us the questions I used to look up on the Internet
"If you had a million dollars what would you do?"
"If you could change one thing about your life what would you do?" Then it was awkward because we didn't ask him back
You know, I used to feel guilty about saying things like that
Is it bad if I don't?
I have the personality of a sperry's topsider and you of a converse allstar
Saying things like whatv
?
Sorry, I like to think of myself as a 2007 Alexander McQueen bootie
Judging him hardcore
I've really been enjoying the last few days with you
Minus you telling me to not drink because I get emotional
Of all things that's what you pick out lol
Lol of all shoes or of all things to not enjoy?
Or of all things to feel bad about doing?
Gotta be direct
The middle one
Things not to enjoy
I feel like we have disagreed on quite a few things, though I too had a great time. Surprising that that was the one you latched onto
Though I can't specifically recall other recent tensions
The drinking thing is the only thing I can think about?
Oh the looking at Oscar's dick thing
You were actually flirting
Just too fucked up to remember
I actually was not
At all
Lol
I'm joking
Ok I only latched onto the drinking thing because it seriously pissed me off
And I proved you wrong anyway
You didn't prove me wrong...?
Sorry I really don't want to upset you again
We can just let it go
You said I would act all emotional and get crazy and whatever
I literally didn't
I didn't mean that time in specific
I meant it was a general risk
So no you didn't do it this last time but you haven't disproven the general fact that it happens sometimes
Regardless I'm glad we both enjoyed the night
Okay then
I understand that it is a difficult conversation for you
Precisely because it is ongoing
Something hard to "prove wrongl
"
What the fuck
And I'll try to be less grating
Why "what the fuck"
No it's not. There are certain things that happen at certain parties that upset me, it's as simple as that.
If I were sober at the parties where I get pissed off I can assure you I'd probably get pissed off sober
And it's often triggered by external forces that you don't inform me of
And you would probably tell me in a reasonable way
And we would move on
But you are drunk so you just get sad and withdrawn until it boils over
No because you always dismiss my problems and say they don't exist
I doubt being sober would fix anything
You don't start crying and trying to drown at sober parties 
It makes the party more fun, no?
Lol
Idk what you're trying to do right now
?
Nvm
I don't know why this is such a difficult topic to have an open and honest discussion about
But if ever that is on the table let me know
It just feels like I can't address some issues to you without having you discredit them
I feel like you don't always take time to listen
I feel the same way except that I feel that I am walking on pins and you can suddenly become upset and withdrawn
Can we agree to set both these behaviors momentarily aside?
Set them aside for what?
Finding a solution 
Do you feel like it's pointless to work on anything now
On one hand yes
On the other hand I would like it to be happy
And us to go to parties without fear that I'll be a dick and you'll get upset
Even for the short time
Talking about this stuff makes everything about us seem pointless
Using those tenses
In a larger sense everything is pointless
But we work things out and do things and create anyway
But if you think it is unnecessary and likely to be a negative experience I understand
And anyway I am going to sleep, so goodnight, and I look forward to tomorrow.
I don't know what I want
All I know is how I feel about certain things and how I feel when things happen but I don't know what to do.
It is like this endless cycle of feelings except I'm scared to share them because they're going to be invalidated 
Which goes for everything in general
And that our expiration date is too soon to feel anything real or to develop anything
Fuck this
You just need to tell me everything you think is wrong with me
Whatever goodnight
I feel very sad that you don't express things for fear of invalidation
I feel like if I tell you I'm upset you're going to say it's not real and not understand where I'm coming from
If I tell you I love you I think you don't believe me 
I feel like emotions and feelings are very complex and form from varying forces that I am as of yet unfamiliar oth
With
Today I cried but I don't know why
I can't think of the right thing to say now
There's so much
I feel like I should apologize
Or ask what it means to say I care about you
No you shouldn't
Or tell you that I will be better
Or to move on
But I don't know
I feel conflicted too
I do know that I like you a lot and I want us both to be happy
Maybe we can talk about this type of thing over dinner
I enjoy the time I spend with you
You are one of my favorite and most important and most influential people in my life
I think it would be better in person
Less disjointed
Okay I'm sorry
No no it's fine
I'm just very tired
And I want to hear you out
But I also want to respond meaningfully
Do you want to do dinner alone tomorrow and meet with will and Reyna Tuesday?
 We will also have the picnic
Whatever you want
I think the sooner we talk this out the better
Ok just work it out with Reyna
Okay 🌚
🌚
I look forward to seeing you and I care for you a bunch, goodnight
Hey when do you think you will finish gone girl?
There's this chick at the lab and she wants to read it but she is like hella poor and I could buy it off you when you finish it to give to her?
Ummm does the program end end this Friday? I can finish it by then.
Or I have a Bookman's credit slip for $8. The book is only $5.
Ya by then
Oh ok that works too
Hey I forgot I am busy tomorrow
And Wednesday 
So either meet w rich boy today or at the end of the week
Are you doing WIW at SAAF on Wednesday?
I'll talk to Reyna
I probably have a lab dinner plus I have a haircut, so probably no
Ok I'll see if someone else can go
Maybe tonight we can read too?
Need some quiet time w my book
Alright!
Tell Oscar to accept my snap request and that its me lol
Lol j
K*
Sup
Cool photo bro
When do you want to meet and should I get a ride?
Where?
Depending on that
Black Crown I thought
You said you want to read
Oh ok. Yeah that's good. I'll come by at 6:30?
No I'm going to scouts
Starts at 7 but I can get picked up around 8
Oh ok
8:20 ok)?
Ya
:)
We are doing push-ups and stuff so i might be out around then
Lol
I'm here
Sorry b :(
Just a sex
Sex
Sec
Coming
The girl has armpit hair
Don't look, but trust me
They're one of THOSE couples
They're both gay
Obvi
It takes one to know one :P
B
O
I want to fuck the shit out of you
N
E
R
?
🌚
🌝
(although it should be the reverse)
I hope your interview goes well!!!!
Well?
Oh Ya it went good
Except the work is gonna be hella difficult 
That's ok
Did you go to your second interview
Are you still sick today
Ya
That's great!!!!! 😊
That it went well, not sick
Just a different sick, more cough and sneeze
Less pain
Did your readings from last night help at all
Just as tired :(
Fuck Ya they did
Second interview is in an hour
Ugh my mom talked to my grandpa's daughter who is a nurse at St. Joseph's and got me an internship there even though I don't want one
And if I intern for 100 hours then I can get a job there
The nurse daughter submitted my resume and recommended me so they put me at the top of their list
Good luck with interview
Shit
Damn
The world revolves around connections and privilege, I hate it
That's what pisses me off the most
About this
I ❤️and hate it
It's not fair to everyone else lol
Anyway I'm so so so happy for you
Have a good rest of your day!
U 2 booboo
Oscar's snap is actually rascodude
Sup
In English, my dad's siblings names are (youngest to oldest):
Daniel
Robert 
Alice
Isaac
Joseph 
David
They are transliterated as:
Dani
Robert
Aliza
Itzik (Itzhak)
Yossi
David
Do you not answer because I upset you
What? You didn't upset me lol
I'm just volunteering at the farm right now b
Lol the snapchat convo is kinda fair
?
Why'd you think you upset me
You opened my snap 
But didn't respond to my text
Phenol chloroform is literally the scariest shit
(Chemical)
The phenol burns/dissolves skin but it is also a local anaesthetic so you can't feel it happening
And the chloroform increases phenol absorption in the skin (more burn) and causes cancer
It can also damage the liver and kidneys, as well as reproductive damage
Omg today
Daniel came in asking if people say fabulous?
remove the "?"
Because he watched this show called abfab
(Absolutely fabulous)
And they explained to him that it's associated with gay men
And I think he laughed
And then he referred to his husband, but just by his name, not as his husband. And only in front of me and the coworker lady. It was a gay day for Daniel.
You wanna hang and talk?
Sorry I'm driving home now so I haven't read anything yet
No I had a lot of plans tonight and canceled cos I was sick, it would be disrespectful. But also I'm just sick and feeling worse
Talk AKA do whatever and then fuck?
That's not what I meant, but okay
Joking b
Well then I'll tell you my stories when I see you next time
Almost home b
Ok I didn't reply to snap convo because I don't think that's a reputable or serious form of communication lol
That's precisely why I don't reply to your snaps!
Like if it was something you actually wanted me to respond to you would text me, you know?
I engineered this whole conflict to make that point
No no, pic snaps are different
Just to test what I learned from house of cards
Thanks b
Like if I send an ugly face you should send one too
It's only fair
Really haha?
2 l8
What happened in the show that made you do this
I'm just kidding
I wish I could plan things out like that
Oh so you actually did get upset lol
Those Hebrew names sound almost exactly like the English ones. They take half of the English name and change the phonetics.
Where is your dad on that list?
I didn't include him
Is the name supposed to be Aaron or something?
I know
But what's the Yair English equivalent
His name doesn't have an English equivalent
I formulated some experiments off of stupid indie romance movies
Or like let them impact my sex life
I thought chloroform was the stuff that made people pass out?
Like what?
Yes it can do that but
You would have to huff it? 
It's not the kind of thing that happens accidentally
That's fucking crazy though. Was there some in the lab? What does one test it on or what's the practicality for it?
"Abfab" lol
Yeah all the straight acting gays totaaaally get men (NOT)
Ya I worked with it almost every day
It's for cheap DNA extraction
Lol did you have to sign forms in case you died
Omg I got a new alcohol hookup
Umm just things feminists say where they're like "you need to do this to keep a man" or "to make your man ___ you need to first ____"
Ya I did
Who is that
To be fair ol' Danny would've had me ;)
Jk
Who is Danny
Feminists?
Daniel
Lol
Oh I thought it was some gay who wanted to hook up in the lab and I was gonna be like, "you're an asshole"
This super sweet Tucson village farm girl ughhh I wanted to call you and talk but I felt bad
I wanted to ask about your interview and the questions and how your day went and shit but I didn't want you talking with an irritated throat
Can I come by lab tomorrow and drop something off?
Yeah like those movies where the feminist is giving advice about men or relationships 
Nasally voiced 47 year-old housewife: Gone girl is truly inspirational 
  
  
Literally ms Sweeney works with this guy:
LITERALLY LOL'd
❤️
🐢🐢🐢
What does "kept" under my voice recording mean
Also you dun acknowledge nothin huh?
Rude
Oh sorry
Mm you could come 
But it would maybe be preferable to just meet tomorrow after? (Think my schedule will actually be clear)
And yeah I don't wanna talk
🌚
Oh okay well Reyna and I are working out tomorrow
And then going to SAAF
I might join you for SAAF
Okay
?
Idk I felt like you didn't want to talk so I left you alone
I didn't want to talk on the phone
I did want to talk
And then I was going to go to sleep
But Sweeney kept talking 
Lol
So now I am actually going to slee
But you have to do the three things
Just send them fast!
Everyone is required
No phony shit
Nooooo
I only have phony shit
Night
🌚
You're terrible
Thx
🌝
Hey what's up
My plans cleared up
Can I come to SAAF?
Is Jay on meth
I'm at sparkroot wbu?
What about your haircut
You don't need to ask lol
Idk, why?
I just got home from work
It is actually next week...
He sent a snap
Can you take me and Reyna?
From spark root? Ok
We at jimmy johns now
Ok I'll be there around 5:55
Ok sorry we're at empire pizza
605 sorry
Kk
🌝
You're probably already asleep but feel better soon!!
Can I pick you up?
5:30-6?
Lol when I saw that I thought you meant then
Yeah it should be fine
I can get a ride somewhere?
Where
When
Well what are we doing tonight?
You don't have to pick me up if you don't want to waste gas
I gotchu 
I'll come by at 5:30
We are getting Korean BBQ
Or 5:45
Whatever time works for you so you can do your things
545 gives you more you time
?
I mean I'm going home at 5 anyway
I'll let you know when I get home
Oh I thought u were getting home at 5:30 and I didn't want you picking me up to be a priority
Oh my GOD that's so sad
Praying to god I'm never the one
On my way
Mmmmmm ok
?????
Scarin me b
I'm just now getting ready but it'll b fine
K
Here
Diviya gets upset with Nate over saying shit, Nate gets upset with Diviya over saying shit, stop undermining and devaluing everything I feel and making me sound like some over emotional and symbolic bitch because your apathy overpowers everything I feel
If I get upset over you joking about us not liking each other as intensely and then get over it, forget it
I don't get why you have to get so pissed off with me for expressing some sort of emotion
Sorry I can't be like you all the time
I'll bet you actual $$ that if anyone said that to someone else in their relationship the other person would be upset too
Or like other things I get upset about
I feel like we probably just don't care anymore
I feel like if I respond with my thoughts you'll say I'm devaluing yours, so I won't.
I seriously won't
I just want to also be able to share emotional things without you saying I'm being irrational
Please share though
I can respect your emotions
I might disagree but go on
That's so bitchy
? Okay then
Well
Comparing to Nate and Diviya is terrible
That's a horribly dysfunctional dynamic
And Nate gets upset about legit things
And Diviya doesn't
For the most part
But also
Nate doesn't 
Nate got upset because Diviya wouldn't hug him goodbye
Start randomly acting withdrawn without explanation 
Start trying to kill himself at parties
^not because of you
Start crying randomly at parties and be inconsolable 
And it was a joke
On many occasions
Is that all?
Basically
I don't have a problem with emotional at all
I have a problem that
Your emotional comes out as a lack of communication
So I can't even fix the problem because you won't tell me what's up
When you say randomly you make me sound like this all happens spontaneously and for no reason
That's what upsets me
And from my perspective it does
Because you don't say shit to me
I feel like you don't care anymore and if I told you you would get upset with me
You wouldn't believe that what I feel is something valid 
Even if it is valid
It does warrant that kind of reaction
Again it's not the emotion
It's the expression
Ok and what was wrong with my expression today
By telling you directly that what you said upset me
And then getting over it
Well I was upset at the kimchi thing
Because you got all quiet
I told you I felt uncomfortable
And that on top of lingering thoughts
Which is a fair thing to say but
I made an effort to talk to people
But at some point you withdrew
And wouldn't even talk to me
I get not starting conversations or engaging
But I don't get why you get all quiet and awkward to me
But anyway that's not important
It was just the chain of events
No but it upsets you and I don't want you to be upset with me
I wish things were like December 
Where we made everything work
You know and the other thing
But like you famously say, it's almost over
You are throwing this at me now for saying it
But you have said it over and over again
Okay yes but I say it by admiring it
"December was so great" implying over and over that it isn't like that now
Not "when we used to really like each other"
There's a difference
And then I'm the Villain for poking fun at what you always say
I say it was a great time and I tell you night after night that I had a great time with you
You literally compared the emotions we have now to then
If you said you had fun in December that's fine
You would have still been upset
I am 100% sure
You bring up events we had fun at in the past all the time
I don't get upset, 100% sure
But not like that like
"I miss December, we had such great times"
You would have been upset
Ok but like I said, I still tell you that I have great times with you whenever I see you
I don't say when we used to like each other
That gives bad connotations
I have a meeting tomorrow so I would rather not drag this out discussing the details. Suffice to say, I'm sorry for what I said, but I hope you consider deeply what I have expressed now.
So good night and if you want to we can continue this discussion tomorrow
Ya wow ok I didnt already listen to you ask me to not drink because you think I would get crazy at the last two parties when I literally didn't act like that at all
Bc I haven't been better in any sense, as of tonight
But yeah, I guess I just don't listen o you
Bc that's what you feel
Good night.
Okay actually it's wrong to go to sleep upset
And angry
I'm sorry. Like I've been better at previous parties I want to be better all the time and this is something I'm committed to. I will work on social things but of course I don't want to ignore you and I want to have a good time just as much as you do. I hope you acknowledge my apology and I want you to know I seriously mean it. I wouldn't make an effort to change anything for you and for myself if I didn't care. 💖 you are one of the greatest things in my life and I hope you have a goodnight, minus bitchiness from earlier, Nature Boy 🌿
❤️
Hey I got out early today what's up
Hey ya boy I was thinking of going to the gym today
What's up with you?
Well
I'm panicking a bit
Why???
 too
Because I'm going to assist the leading medical historian (in the world)
Idk whether to say yes or no to getting a fake ID...
So I need to read this thing this weekend
The doctor said
In preparation
It's 115 pages.
Fuck me
Is it another dense piece?
~
Oh shit... This weekend?!!
Yes
So I'm going to the library now
I'm printing it out
And that's only the non optional reading
Lol bring lots of quarters
Lol I'm printing at home
Ohhh you're going to read at the library. 
I really need to start analyzing the literature regarding visual learning
I assume you're going to read more than the optional
To have a report next Friday
*mandatory
Probably need at least 10 pages of writing, which means a shitton of reading because I don't know shit about the topic
What's the fake ID decision coming down to
Awww I'm at the park right now and there is a mailman who parked in the shade and he is sitting at a table and thinking and just resting
Idk it's really cute
So does a report mean you need to just analyze it and the credibility or you need to read it and formulate your own opinion or....? Like what could you possibly add to his research
No
Well today I read an article on Vice about how being 21 doesn't mean jackshit anymore since kids these days have access to everything
It means I need to summarize the literature
So I came to the conclusion that I won't
Lol link article?
Analyze all the literature on the topic
Present what is most compelling
So you're going to read all the stuff over the weekend and your report is due Friday? What are you doing the rest of the weekdays?
No ok 
The reading is for the historian coming Monday
The report is for the more general project, and I need significant updates every Friday
Ahh and what is the reading topic for the leading historian? How are you going to assist him?
He is coming in to
Analyze the records of this collaboration between NASA and the Tohono O'odam tribe in the 70's
And so I am reading a summary of that endeavor
A really fucking long summary
In order to be of use to him
Basically with the other work I'm doing the legwork for the doctor so he can get to researching
Hey sorry I was working out
On my home right now
Cool, what was the collaboration? Is there an internet link or something?
How is it related to medicine?
I'm worried about working during the school year :/ idk how I'm going to get enough sleep and do hw
No, they aren't public records, I got it on a USB drive of a scanned old text from 1979. I can check but I don't think it's available online. No wiki article.
Oh I'll just explain it I misread your text
Basically there were remote people without access to healthcare, so that was a problem. Also NASA wanted to work on its technology to treat health problems that arise on space flights. 
So
They spent all this money setting up this technology so that these remote small clinics and a special van could video conference with doctors
So that the remote people could get treatment
In 1972
There won't be as much HW!
But yeah it will probably take out from your free time and social time
By a lot
Ahhh I see the NASA connection. Providing healthcare when it is scarce. Was this conducted on the reservation prior to the reservation attaining better 
healthcare? When you say remote peoples are you referring to the natives
Ahhh I see the NASA connection. Providing healthcare when it is scarce. Was this conducted on the reservation prior to the reservation attaining better healthcare? When you say remote peoples are you referring to the natives
Yeah I told them I could close on some nights until 10/10:30...
I'll probably talk to them once I get my schedule and see how I can handle everything
Didn't you want to start working to have some pocket money? I thought that was your plan
I convinced Bella and Reyna to apply to savers with me
I love the feeling after working out when I get to relax, watch a movie, and eat some trader joes frozen meal
I wish you would come with me hahah
What do you mean prior to attaining better healthcare?
And yes, natives
I did want to work but
This opportunity I can't pass up, more worth it than an $8 an hour job
I do too
Maybe we can have a work date?
Get some chill food and coffee
Work
And then do something fun
I am 29/114 as of now
So I'm making good progress but
The parts I have read so far have had a good number of photos, more than the rest of the text
I assume the reservation now has decent hospitals
I'm not entirely educated on that so don't hurt me
They had decent hospitals then too
Hahahah lucky you. Let's hope more of the book is like that
The issue is that it's a big area
With small populations
Yeah we can do something. I'm not doing anything right now except for tumblr and the girl with the dragon tattoo
So many people are far from healthcare, and they, at least back then, may not have had cars, etc.
It would be a day-long trek to get to and from a clinic
I'm actually near you now
Oh you're at that library?
I can meet you
I'm gonna call
Here
Ok I'll be out in 2
Are you ready for the moon
🌚
🌚
Boucher Bistro
Sorry b I woke up 
Cos Sweeney
hahahah
Vice has the funniest shit
That in Tucson?
Nope
Obligatory
"But brown is differenttttt"
Lol one reason I'm excited for you to go there is to hear about your experience 
🌚 for real, sorry!
🌚
Hi b
Hey how you doing today?
Still feeling sick? :(
Also whenever you want to take a reading break open the snaps
Haven't started reading for the morning but
I had 🍆 off twice, the second finishing JUST before your snaps came so
Yes still shit shit shit
Sergioooooo 
You need to watch house of cards ugh
Since when do you believe this?
Hey sorry
I had church... Seriously considering telling my mom I can't go anymore
Before my snaps CAME
HAHAHAHA
*hahahah. No caps.
I can watch it today! I feel like I have to re watch it all though since it's been a while
Yasmeen sent a snapchat with a picture of The New Jim Crow and then "summer read 😍😍"
Well I certainly believe that it's fucked up how where a person is born makes all the difference
I believe in the concept of abolishing nations as an original institution, but it's already too far established
Reyna and I talked about this and her first response was, "I can see Sophia doing this" lol
It's unfair how I have the right to do something other human beings don't only because of my birthplace 
When we are the same color, etc.
Ummmm
Are you being facetious?
Maybe about the nations thing but not the birthplace rights problem
??
???
Completely not practical at all. Promoting a policy of acceptance of illegals is destruction of the economy.
No I'm saying in principle
The logical extreme that you propose
Not the current scenario
Hey sorry
I've been all over the place
But I did not forget about you, I swear
What's up?
How are you doing on your reading?
I'm currently making a chocolate peanut butter banana smoothie
I see you opened the snaps hahahah
My mom calls me big butt boy and it makes me cringe
When I was a child I was fast and efficient at bagging groceries and it was a job I was considering doing
Fuck Aimee!!!
My mom found weed in my brother's backpack...
She's going to take it to the police station
Hi sorry I was asleep
Wtf
Literally wtf
Hey lol
What a cute story from the girl
And what a realistic career...
Your mom's ideas about the police sometimes...
I am on like page 70
Lol ok I was like 14
She ended up calling her friend who is a DEA agent so we'll see how that goes
Her and my brothers are out for a movie now
As long as your brother doesn't admit you do it
I have it planned out
I'm just gonna say I lied to find out if he does
Make him feel less bad about himself
It's fucked up I know
Lol sounds like something you would do
Hahah I'm gonna see Priscilla queen of desert tonight at the loft
How is Aimee doing
Hi
I am ok I just got back to reading
I took one of those naps that just made me feel like shit
Like I got run over by a truck. I need to stop myself from napping midday because it just sucks
Did you take two naps today???
I'm so sorry b :( I hate those naps
I'm out with Trenton and Reyna right now. We left black crown and we finished eating at Zayna's
Who is the kid with the long hair?
No just one nap that I am still recovering from
The "not a phase" pic?
Don't day naps usually fuck up your sleeping schedule
Like when I take naps I stay up late and then don't get enough sleep
Ya that pic. Mmm maybe, but I usually take naps on weekends, when I can sleep in the next day.
Oh that's Reyna. I decided to give her a lesbian cut
Since you're gonna be doing serious work this week do you think you might not party's
*?
Depends
Did you save the Reyna pic? Wanna reexamine it
What is your conclusion
Hawt
I like
It's bad tho
Enjoying your night out?
Awww did you get the snap from Oscar
Nah
That said he misses us
Saw we
Awww*
Reyna and Trenton have been playing scrabble while I'm reading lol. We are heading to the loft right now
How have you been enjoying your day?
I feel like your day has been sad. Idk why.
Do you think the term cracker [bitch] is offensive?
It has been stressful a bit but not sad
Lol Sunomi wants to hang out like right now so I might do that, just to get out.
Que and Que
Add "so"!
To make quedó
Queso
Bring her to Priscilla
Tell her to go to the loft lol
What time is it at?
10
OK
OK
Where are you guys now
Black crown
Trenton is taking us to the loft in a few
K
Reyna's mom: "I'm seriously becoming lesbian. n are too crazy"
Lol
She would pick up all the lesbians 
What if she actually became one
Lesbians are crazy tho
Like mentally ill crazy
And weird
And mean
This time when she was there to pick us up there was a white guy
He looked drunk
And acted drunk
Reyna's mom is a little weird and inconsiderate so
I feel like I don't know anyone who is a lesbian
I know bi girls and girls who would experiment but no lesbians
I'm so glad you came 😘
I have met a few over the years and they sucked. But yeah I don't know any now either.
What did drunk guy do
I am glad too b
Gonna go listen to the Priscilla soundtrack and read some
How did Sunomi like the movie?
She actually loved it
Drunk guy pinched ass and slurred his I love you's
:(
🌚
Lol so random
So you're sleeping now?
Ja
🌝
🌚
Hahah no, you should send 🌞
Noooooooo
Okay okay, fine
🌚
🐢🐢🐢
🌞
I decide the time of day
Gay leaders finally allowed to serve in Boy Scouts lol but only if the troop's views are "consistent"
Sometimes I wonder why you have the power to end our conversations
Then I remember you fall asleep at like 4:17pm
You know atheists are not allowed in Boy Scouts 
There's always this secret society of them at every campout though. The kids ditch church services and talk about controversial liberal stuff. Not even kidding.
Whatever event I go to I try to find the deviants. Think church camp and how I found girls to talk about anal with.
I'm home alone for the next 2.5 hours lol
What happens if they find out someone is an atheist
Deviants can be fun or annoying. If it's the deviants of the liberal group, they suck. The deviants of a conservative group can be variable but often good.
That's cool, I know what you are implying and I like it but I am reading
Was that bitchy?
Slightly ya but I felt bad for distracting you
Like not bc of what you said
:(
Unintended
Don't worry, if I felt distracted I would just put the phone down
If the adults or staff members find out a scout is an atheist then you're asked to leave and you actually can't be in the scouting program
Funny though because they accept Buddhists and Hindus... 
Idk about Muslims. I remember a camp where one kid said a breakfast prayer in Spanish and there was huge outrage among scouts and parents because "nobody could understand" and "this is America"
Deviants of the liberal group - Josh, who sucks, lol.
"I hate sex" at the sex ed video
The deviants of conservative groups are pretty fun. It's nice to hear about something besides guns, cars, and Dubstep when I'm at camp. 
I think I'm going to go back to B&N today. I had too much fun.
Maybe tonight with me?
I'm on the last 10 pages now
Lol
Got distracted, sorry
Definitely! I'm going this afternoon and then we can go later tonight too
Great job!!!!!!
😊😊😊
More pics?
Hi
Hey what's up?
My mom yesterday about the weed in a fry's prescription pill bottle: "what's this? Is this oregano??"
What ended up happening?
I'm going to the family friend, I'll be done before 4 and in your area
She sent pics and is giving it to her attorney, I think
Ok cool hopefully Im able to go ou
She has diabetes?
I'm almost done no actually
Now
What's up
What's up
What's up
Sorry I'm finishing up food
The drug also has a positive effect on polycystic ovarian syndrome which her doctor's pretty sure She has
Oh well I need to shower and stuff
I was expecting 3:30
/3:45
Earth to you. hello. earth to Aimee.
I swear nobody's phone dies as much as yours
Oh ok
I'm good
It did die
Hello
So what's the plan
Where are you right now
Ok so I'm at miller golf links library
Do you want to go to B&N right now?
"miller golf links"
PCOS sux
?
Oh oops
Nvm I thought you meant something else
??
Ok
I do but i should shower first
Ok how about
So you aren't rushed and so I have some time to read I could come at 4:15?
Unless that's bad for you
No that's perfect
K
Kiki
Status?
 There in 2
Kk
Here
You end up seeing a movie?
Nah too late :(
What's up
Well I want to talk to someone but everyone is being annoying
Lol
What's up on divas
I heated up a kashi meal and made a cup of passion fruit & papaya black tea 
Also checking out New Yorker articles. What's up w you?
Nobody replies to anything
And Reyna comments on our privare chat but I want to hear other people
Don't be surprised if for the picnic I heat up a frozen meal and put it in Tupperware lol
Lol I might steal that idea
I'm chillin with the tortoise
Is it quiet at home 
No it's not at all. The news is blaring and my mom is yelling lines from children's books
Anyway, I'm excited California decided to open desalination plants. The arguments against it are pretty weak except for the technological malfunctions or and end to the drought
*or an
Thanks New Yorker! :)
Why yelling?
It's expensive tho...
That's the real problem
I've started to pick up on her accent.
You know, paying more money for local services that will eventually level out is pretty damn worth it to me. It only consumes 20% more energy than taking water from other areas and it will raise the water bill for Californians about $5 more.
Its pretty negligible for the citizens
That's true. On the system though it's a large cost
And the higher cost to farmers = more expensive food 
🌚
Sorry, I was reading
Love, 🌚
Sorry b Sweeney kept me up
But 4 real 🌚
Hahahah get some sleep and I hope everything goes well for you tomorrow🌚
Madeleine might consider spironolactone, it's an anti-androgen
I wonder if she has had androgen levels tested?
Or if the PCOS has not induced problematically high tesosterone levels
She seems to not have the secondary sex implications of high T
So I told her that and
She says she's never been tested and she only has symptoms of PCOS, but the thing is that when she gets an ultrasound there were no cysts or thickening of the uterine wall. Nobody can explain it.
What symptoms?
"Welllllll I get the weight gain, obviously, excess hair, few/no periods, sleep apnea, ugly-ass stretch marks, and my fertility's never been tested lol so idk. And I have slightly increased T3 and T4 levels"
Well if she doesn't have cysts it isn't PCOS...
She knows that, but because she expresses the symptoms her doctor treats it like it is.
That's kinda silly though
That's a poor doctor I would say
Ya but what can a single teacher mom with three kids afford
Anyway
How was your first day with the famous historian?
They have insurance...
What's up with you
I didn't interact with him much, he is a quiet guy.
And he was just reading all day
But I had a cool day
What about you?
I am working on my various applications for things at brown
Sup
That's pretty funny haha. Not what I expected at all. what did your day consist of then since you weren't much help to the historian? 
I went to the gym today and the moment I did my warmup run I felt nauseous. Still, I persisted through it for around 15 minutes and went on with my workout, but I felt sick the entire time.
I've been reading and drinking tea all day because I feel slightly shitty.
Oh cool, what are some of the applications for besides that one newspaper you want 5 positions for hahah
Also almost nobody fun is going to Jay's thing tomorrow. Diviya and Nate and Jennifer and Martha will be out of town. Reyna doesn't want to go. Madeleine is only going for an hour.
I spent all day reading papers. There's no clear focus for the project yet so I felt pretty lost but the doctor gave me the best pep talk ever
:( I really hope you aren't getting what I have. That's how it was
Just that and phage hunters right now.
Yeah I don't think I'm gonna go. :(
Haha what was the much needed pep talk about?
I hope I'm not either :( I can tell that whatever I have is in the beginning stage of what is yet to come, though. I'm still going to the party because I bought food for it and it'll be interesting to see the (now) juniors get fucked up.
I hope you had a great day 😊
I might ask to take the car to Jay's so I can leave whenever I want the next morning. Maybe hike sabino canyon at 5 or something.
Oh!!!! I get my license tomorrow
It was just like a "don't worry I don't expect you to be PhD worthy within days. No stress"
Tell me how it goes! I might join you for the hike actually
That would be fun. I could meet you there at 5
Congrats!!!
Don't fuck it up 
"...within days, rather within hours. Get to work, bitch!!!" Hahahahah
Okay b 😘
He is a super optimist
He's thinks things will just always work out
And I appreciate that
He's actually super not elitist
He doesn't think he is the bomb and he really likes other people and doesn't judge 
Well I don't know him. All of my assumptions were purely based on what I've heard haha and all the pressure he placed on you, but I'm glad he met and exceeded your expectations. That is really great. I'm glad that you have this opportunity and you're enjoying it.
What were some things you talked about that made you realize these things?
Are you still stationed in the hospital or?
Well he was very humble to the historian but he also talked about the scientific process and how his life goes and just a lot
Kinda
Same building but not the hospital proper
To be fair the lab I was in before was officially the college of medicine
So in the same capacity as I was in the hospital before, yes
Now my mom knows about me and 🌿
?
But she wasn't upset
Why
Why
I told her I don't like it too much
She asked me and I answered
Why wasn't she upset
Because to her I've only done it once...
And I talked about it in a very reflective, intellectual way
Even threw in the 🌿 is safer than drinking bit
Some probably had to do with the fact that I tried it at 16 vs. my 12 year old brother
Would she call the 🚔🚓🚔 on you
No but
She is going to test me every month (she says)
why can't times be simple anymore
I miss you
I mean that to the full extent to which I could mean it and to which you can perceive it
You have no idea
D:
:)
What are you even doing???
Nothing at all
I wanted to read but I am exhausted
Wbu
I tried to photoshop cleopatra onto my tortoise's body
But I got mad because my computer was being dumb and I suck at photoshop
You going to bed soon?
Hahahah what ended up happening with that
Pic?
Like how far did you get
Actually it's alright. I'm tired too and I'll see you later. 🌚
Aw
🌚
Sorry b
?
I'm so upset and stressed out. I feel like shit right now.
I felt like the fuck up part of my life was past me
I feel like I'm losing everything and things have been falling apart
I feel like I've let my mom down, like I've let you down, and just everyone
What?
Why do you feel like this?
Because my mom actually did get upset
She was calm at first but then started yelling
And I've been sitting alone in my room thinking
And crying
:(
Sometimes the truth hurts. It's hard to tell the truth like that.
Maybe you should just go to sleep. I promise you will feel better in the morning
She was starting to feel proud of me for my turnaround only to find out about my hypocrisy for criticizing my brother's drug use
This is also a product of her ignorance, but still
She will move on and be proud again
She will see what is important
There's a high chance I will be required to get drug tested by the court
??
How would the court be involved
She had to tell her attorney
You aren't part of the custody case
Custody case for my brother
Well I'm linked to her
The allegations are that I abuse my brother
Are you indicted for that?
You know you should probably consult your own lawyer
Because this whole thing is absurd
There is going to be a full in-home investigation over the following weeks, including interviews
I can't handle this
I know the entire "I'm only 17" thing sounds like bullshit to everyone else
What exactly led to this? I am so confused
But I really can't handle this
It's so draining
Maybe you could live with Diviya or something for a short time
My brother refusing to come home with my mom and her calling the cops is basically where it all started
Or Reyna 
It started with his attitude
None of my other friends have to deal with their family the way I do, ugh
Have you told your mom how it affects you?
You all focus on school and relationships and your healthy families, for the most part
That this whole ordeal is unhealthy for everyone?
Sure some drug/prison problems with Reyna
Literally you would all be better off if she just dropped this case
But it's not something that consumes her and her mom 
Yes and she got pissed off with me
And she said she loves my brother as much as she loves her other children and that she "won't lose Richie to his dad"
I haven't had one fucking goddamn conversation without her bringing it up
No matter who the fuck we talk to
Strangers, family friends, church friends
It has to fucking come up in conversation
"Oh yes your pot pie was delicious Sally, by the way, Richie isn't here because... Oh. You know how ex husbands can be..."
A joke scenario but I'm serious
Sleep tonight. And then run tomorrow. Or write. I know it's difficult but occupying yourself and avoiding her will be best
I'm sorry
Also start drinking cranberry juice
No it's fine!
You are one good thing in my life
If things piss me off I try to stay busy
That's not true
You have Reyna 
And all your friends even if you feel distant right now
And Billings ❤️
I was going to say the one but then I realized I have others haha
😝

Welcome to 'Deciphering Emojis: the analysis and impact emoji-sending has on your significant other' with Aimee Askira
Ok anyway lol idk have a goodnight
But real essay topic, no?
Clinton forgot to get dressed yesterday 
Lol
I feel like absolute shit. You were so right. :(
Also lol nooooooo. She had another fail this week with her climate change stance promotion:
At least no weed leaves
Sorry b, I should have been careful even though you said it was ok
Cos it SUCKS
No it's all my fault. 
Sergio: "I love getting sick!"
lol
many people mistakenly thought it was the leaves
Have a great day!!! ☺️
I love this^
I remember a few days before I got sick I had a sore throat and hoped it wasn't the start, then a couple days later I just felt like shit, not really in a describable way, just definitely shitty
No absolutely symptoms
Absolute*
I think this may be the flu
Is that Angela meeker
rkel
Jk
How significant is a chancellor in Germany? Like there's the president but what is her role?
For me it was the morning strep throat that went away within an hour, but today it's full body fatigue and that heavy, dazed feeling pulsating through my head, along with throat and nasal discharge.
Yeah that's what it was!
Like exactly
Btw strep throat refers to a specific bacteria
Dunno about ferment
Germany
Seems pretty important tho
Hey bae
What's up?
Are you sure you're not going to Jay's?
Hey
Prolly not
Mayb
Maybe
Wbu
I spoke to Annika today
She is so cool now
Zheng?
Annika Zhang
Ya
Oh yeah, where is she?
Chicago, northwestern
What's she studying?
Is she in town?
No
Biology/physiology, minor in critical theory
I might go, idk yet
It might be a fun drive
With my mom though, bc I failed the test lol
Her parents moved with her to chicago, and onto Maryland so she doesn't come here
Ya I saw that lol
How did that happen
Fuck... I didn't expect her to be so interested in that
I thought she was the strict biology type
See she's super cool
Like actually really cool
Ehhhh I would hate that
If my mom moved with me
That's social suicide
Lol i hit the cone while parking after my 3 point turn.
What is it that makes her cool
Please don't tell me fucking dudes
I'll lose respect for you
No no
It was only for like a couple months, they moved away
To Maryland as I said.
And she didn't live with them
Reyna and I are doing a nude photo shoot together
Or even see them that much
Whoa when
It's probably a bigger deal for her bc she's tooless
Topless
Tonight
Lol That's  really funny about the cone
At Jay's
Did you know if you know you are gonna hit it you can tell them and restart?
In front of them?
Actually chicks
But no she's just cool idk
A lot going on in her life
No they changed the policy in April
Hahahahaha 
I'm sitting in front of the hospital waiting
Doing things and being busy make you cool
And this black family is loading into a car with blasting 98.3
Jk jk
Like ridiculously loud
Waiting for what lol?
My parents. I don't park here cos it's either $9 or a long walk
I actually want to start listening to that station now
Last night someone called me pretentious
Who
I think I need to tone down the NPR hahah
Anthony
Lol
But you parked across the street for the Kiela lab??
Annika is really into like archery and art and the restaurant scene
No usually I was driven
Like maybe 5 times I parked there 
It was hard to find spots and I suck at parallel parking
Is it being interested in that or having extensive knowledge about that that makes one interesting?
Idk she is just cool to talk to ok
You know
She said she hadn't talked to anyone from basis except me since going to college
That's so sad
Lol basically Anthony
Only me and Shawn
But really, I think it'll be the same for all of us
What about his girls?
We won't text people that often
Maybe 3/4 people
I would hope to at least talk when we are in town...
Nope, arri was the girl person
I feel like once I go to college I intend to talk to Diviya and Reyna and maybe Jen or Bella
Haven't you made your post-high school list too, haha?
Lol no I'm more optimistic
I also don't think there is a reason we can't talk
You know, 80 people were invited to the party
Shit
I asked Reza to make it big and invite everyone
Everyone - all the grads who I'm not friends w on Facebook, lol
lol wtf
Also my sickness was gone within an hour of being awake
How are you feeling? What did you do today at work?
Any developments?
Are you watching the Lightning 
Today is hardcore
I am feeling better
Work is fine. Analyzing textbooks today
I'm driving in it
I love lightning but driving towards it feels suicidal hahah
Car is the safest place to be in lightning
Don't worry
Are you gonna retake the driving test
I can't believe you failed it
No one does that :P
I know haha but I get scared easily and I'll end up spinning out
I'm retaking it next Tuesday
I was super pissed off I ate 20 mcnuggets and felt gross after
Look at this!!' I want to make something like this before you leave
Some Little Prince inspired art
It's Wyatt's sister's art
That's 1000 calories
I know...
That's so pretty
And 90% of my daily fat
I was disappointed with myself
Today when I told my mom that I have job training tomorrow, her first response was "okay. What are you going to do if your brothers dad comes into savers and starts harassing you."
Followed by a 15 minute lecture
:(
That must be frustrating
Don't feel bad everyone has fat days
Where u at
Just left best buy
Where
With whom
My plans got canceled
I am free
Plans?
Bass lesson?
Ya
We can go to party?
Now?
Haha no at 7:30 ish
We can hang before if you want
I'm gonna go to the library
You can join me if you want.
Or not if you don't want
All good
Sure, which one?
I'm gonna write a book
Wilmot
That a joke? Haha
Anti semitism in medicine
For real
Ahhh 
It would be fun
Is this for the internship or independent study?
No just for me
I'll write it in college
I would like to start writing articles
For the NYT or New Yorker
Go out and investigate
Interview drug lords
Omg
I have some writing to do today too though
For which news agency?
Last night I read an article on the New Yorker about super tunnels for drug smuggling
It was fascinating
I got inspired to write after reading it
So beautiful
L
What's up
Sorry I'm getting ready to go to the library
Brushing teeth and all that
Wtf my mom is getting off
Ugh
She's inside
I saw her
She didn't see me
Whet care tiof 
Today the doctor was trying to say that the nurse's book had more illustrations instead of photos and he called it "a compensatory hypertrophy of illustrations" it took me a bit to understand
How do you know it's his bf?
Facebook stalking
They look like each other
What's up
Explain the doctor comment..
Also that video is great
Nothing really. Making food. Wbu?
How was your day? What did you do
I was so pissed off because  Joseph came up to me after you left and apologized because he said he wouldn't have come if he knew you were going, since he feels that when he's there he monopolizes your attention
Also there are so many stories omg
Well, what he said isn't untrue, but I told him that his assumptions about me shouldn't determine whether or not he comes.
Last night jay and I were sitting on the floor in his parent's bathroom while playing with the dog, and I said I love it when dogs lick me because I feel loved. Then jay said, "the dogs can lick our faces and then we can kiss each other and we technically wouldn't be kissing since the dog's saliva is on us"
Also this black guy from Tucson high came and he kept hitting on me. Booby invited all of these Tucson high guys and Sadie invited her TH girls
We played beer pong and danced a bunch together. Another gay guy joined us for twerking to gasolina 
I watched over Jose as he threw up and he fell asleep in the shower :(
Had to hold his hair and hands back
I failed my other babysitting duties because Nina had to go out and console Ivan (who was upset and taking a walk outside) and she told me to watch Yulitza, the friend in the pic, when I got distracted and when I tried to look for her she was off fucking Abi's ex
*Ulitza
Where are you going?
Lol you waver between saying he's super humble to super pretentious
I can't quite get this guy
Family friend's house just got here
Literally fucking him?
Did you see it?
And did Abi bring him
Yes, literally fucking him. People accidentally walked into the room where they first went, and then Joseph told me that as he was exiting the bathroom the girl came up and said "he needs to go pee" and then they both went in together
Abi brought him and left his ass lol. She was like, "he wanna be fuckin another girl then he can stay the night"
She was super dramatic
Nina and I had to calm her down
But look at her!!!
She talks like a chola but got the smarts of a schola
Although abi invited us to another party on Friday lol
She said its gonna be ghetto af. Everyone hooks up and grinds.
Sounds fun
Such a good pun
Us includes you, lol
Wait so she started the night as his gf?
I know lol
Would you want to go?
No actually, they're only friends but she still has feelings for him even though they dated in 9th grade.
Last night keagan took a video of me doing/saying something funny and then Wyatt said if I liked being filmed that his sister is looking for inspiration for a new piece, and I said I'm famous for my inspirational pussy pop and Keagan got really really uncomfortable and stopped filming me
This morning I stayed with jay and Joseph and Elizabeth, but it got awkward once Joseph left bc jay and Liz were fighting and then when things settled down he put his hand up the front of her shirt in front of me, while talking to me
Turns out Fatboys Laydee is my cousin on my mom's side...
Lol  @ Keegan
How did you find out about fat boys 
Keagan*
Why were they fighting 
Yeah probably would
The guy posted a video of Abi sitting on the toilet on her story..
How did Abi go to basis
She messaged me directly lol and she was all excited but I'm scared to open the message.
Jay left pretty late last night to go get coke (??? And Ulitza and her hookup wanted some and they were like, "yes please! I need something to wake me up") and jay's mom got upset bc Jay wasn't responding and she kept yelling at Elizabeth and saying she holds Liz equally responsible. Liz got upset and doesn't want him to keep doing stupid shit like this. Jay thinks she's unreasonable.
Jay's mom threatened to call the cops
Did you get to sleep at a reasonable time?
Also how is the family friend doing?
Sometimes hanging around ghetto people is so much fun
Ulitza told me about her fights with other guys and girls to protect her gay older brother
I wish you were there, it would have been a lot of fun. I could have waken up to something nicer than Nina jumping on the bed, hahah.
Oh that actually sounds scary
Did ulitza do it
Lol link?
Did you open the message?
I need ghetto in my life
I wish I was there too. That said, I totally wouldn't have been decent at work today if I had stayed
But it sounds so crazy
Did you talk to keagan other than that?
Oh, and Elliot pulled his dick out on Diego
Jay ended up chickening out or something, I'm not sure. He didn't get it but the people who wanted it were kinda upset.
It's on Abi's snapchat story lol. We were laughing about it in the morning but Jay was pissed bc they conspicuously flashed bottles of Malibu and vodka in his bathroom
No haha I might never reply
When I talk to ghetto people I turn really ghetto. Probably due to my upbringing and growing up with my family.
I say shit the way they did in the thug porn video we watched
Code switching I never thought I was capable of
Yeah! It was the most keagan and I have ever talked. He's awesome. I almost drunkenly apologized for sharing that NPR article about trans hormones but then I realized that would be offensive and he probably didn't read it
How was Charlotte doing?
My family friend's mom hooked up with son-in-law's brother :O
Like my friend's ex husband's brother hooker up with her mom
Because his wife died
How did that happen
Yeah it's probably good you didn't
That would have been awkward
At least for me
If I were in that position
Wedding day 1969
That seems pretty fucked up. Like both people who were married want to forget about each other and then this strange connection has to be established. It breaks both the bro and girl code.
In a fucked up way though
How did what happen?
I had the best time with the greensfield kids. They asked me if I wanted to ditch the party to go with them to losbetos but since they weren't returning I decided not to go.
Do people get married in glasses
I've never seen someone get married in glasses
Wtf
I thought that too
But it's a good look
Their smiles are very homicidal-esque but the bridesmaid's dress is killer
Her family is just a fuck up
Hahah see the connection?
At least relationship wise
I'm so hilarious
What are other freaky stories, Aimee, darling?
I can't tell you I feel bad
Yes it's like out of a movie
That's her mom
Not bridesmaid
I know right it looks so good
Damn mama can't get it!!!!
*can
Lol ok but my grandpa's son fucked his cousin
I'm positive it can't get any worse than that.
I'm sorry, but the men look hideous in those photos
No it actually gets way worse
Like way worse
She fucked her sibling
Omg she fucked her son
Something incestuous to an incredibly personal degree
The mom fucked my friend's husband :(
While they were together??
Yes
Is that why they divorced?
God, this is one horny mom
No, and that's the worst part
Who is this lady
Lol the mom married 2 impotent guys
Jesus
I know it's just so bad
And that's not even the start
Continue?
Why did they divorce then?
I feel bad
I love the pic
How was your day
I'm driving home now
Hahah it's okay then
Yeah I've been finding the best GIFs ever
Well, I'm sick as shit. I lost my voice entirely and I was going to respond to one of your voice messages but I literally could not speak.
And today I had to go through training like that too :( which, btw, is Sunday from 10am-1pm and I get paid $8.75 an hour, holla 
Although with this $15 minimum wage business for fast food I feel like I chose the wrong job
I stayed with Jay and Elizabeth and Joseph until 11pm today and went home, napped, went to job meeting, and then basically did nothing the rest of the day lol
*am
Lol not in AZ
Send gifs?
I am so sorry :(
I am still sick
Tomorrow I get my schedule. And right now my balls are so shiny and nice
Going to doctor on Friday
Should balls be shiny
Yes, they are shiny when you pull them back and squeeze the scrotum skin
But you can open my snaps and be the judge of that
I know not in AZ lol but just you wait a couple more years
It's fine honestly. Today was the only intolerable sick day.
Whenever I go to the doctors and I'm sick he tells me to wait it out, lol
 
Sergio I need to go on a mega shopping spree
 
Mmmm I doubt it
About the wage
Mine usually too but this is a weird cough
For too long
Is you telling me about the shopping spree an invitation?
More winter clothes hmm?
Hahahahahahah
That's amazing
Priscilla invited me to go on a shopping spree with her tomorrow but I'm not buying anything
I remember you had this serious infection one time
Something to do with your lungs and chest
It concerned me so much
I have our poetrygenius shirts!!!
No just like professional clothes
Nothing fun
Khakis, button downs 
Maybe jeans if I'm feeling antsy. Or polos...
I don't recall an infection?
Oh
The skin infection 
Yeah that infection was super my fault
Skin infection??
Yay shirts
It was a skin infection on my chest
No no something about your cough and there was liquid in your lungs or something
Hmm?
Yeah lol
Begins with an r
Maybe connected to binding?
I think?
I actually need to get polos for work
Kewl
I've never seen you in jeans!
 2
Ok ur gonna sleep now
Yo gets it
Niet
I'm gonna jerk and then go to sleep
I wanted to do that today too
But I felt too sick
:((( bb
I was gonna do that maybe 20 min ago
Open snaps first?
Did it hotty
Loved the from above boner pic 
I'm jerking off :(
There's just something that elevates a dick pic when it's like "damn, that dick fucks me"
Pic
More....?
That was hot
Results?
Results in a sec :)
I finished too
Nice nice
Weird how you get constant pleasure and I get it 85% at the end
84.76% by my calculation sir
I'm such an idiot
I got cum all over my shirt
Hahahah
Well mister
I await to fuck my prince
You be awaitin a long time
Jk
Good night 😚
Lol ok then that's cool
I can survive... Maybe :/
Goodnight 😋
Ya it's an invitation to shop btw
None of that mall shit though unless it's dillards 
They don't carry my size :O
Wtffff...
Thanks for that. I'll send you a fucked up pic from the textbooks tomorrow
Hahahah looking forward to it. And good! We can find better places
Buenas noches cariño
 
The top one is a cut off cancerous dick
I can't find some of the other notable nasties
The bottom of it is the head 
U answer Fb but not me
Ya sorry it took too long to repress the emotional trauma
Those pictures can NOT be real 😷
They both surprisingly look like shits
One bloodied and the other on someone's pooch
Also, I thought you forgot about sending pics lol so they were completely unexpected 
Saw this and thought of you hoy. Part of a collection of LGBTQ+ pride pins.
I want that top one
Sorry b
You gotta know how the world b
With the pics
That's the one that reminded me of you haha
How the world be for 1 out of... Mmmm... how many thousands of people, maybe?
Can you do a bit more explaining about this opportunity on August 11th
You and Bloomberg business and finding one of those business card holder folders actually made me realize the importance of connections, so I think I'm gonna do it
It's humbling when you become the thing you despised
Well it's gonna be a fairly large group but
The idea is that various educators, and students of all levels will come together to look at some online medical education videos 
and then we rate and give comments
It is for the development of K-12 medical courses.
You will meet all kinds of cool people
Including a cute Finnish guy from Boston University
Named Matti
Lol
I agree about the humbling
I hated some people for working so hard in high school 
But now I just wish I was one of them
And I'm working on becoming one of those
Ok this is gonna sound ambitious and I guess that is okay, but is it résumé-worthy or a network builder?
It's one day hunty
You can't put one day on a resume
Also did Isamu have Kittredge or Fulford?
Oh see, I thought it was just a lunch for a further project
But maybe it will lead to something
That's how you made it sound
I'm so fucking excited to start this year!!!!
I asked to switch to Billings as my CC but I think I should have Kitt and ask for billings to write my letter....
but yeah. Isamu question?
Well you might meet cool people
But it's not too likely. Still, everything is an opportunity
I mean you will meet them for sure but I don't know how much personal contact
Well there is a lunch
So maybe you can get lunch with some cool prod
Prof
Maybe Matti could be a friend when I go to Boston
Idk about Isamu 
Billings will write you a letter anyway
But if you have Kitt he would have to write you a letter two
Too
As in, there are three letters of req. two teacher + college counselor
You could ask him? I think he had Kitt... Not sure
What's up
Hey sorry
I'm at JCP to get school supplies for my brother but there is no reason for me to be here
My mom got pissed off because the lawyer and the therapist had to interview Alex (???) and I said he's not very intelligent and he says random things all the time and can't have a cogent conversation, but she got pissed off and started telling me that I should never disrespect family and that children are "smarter than you think. How can they cry and communicate when they need to have a diaper change"
What's up w you today?
I know there are three, but idk if I could have billings as a counselor and also have her write an APUSH letter
Oh right sorry you have bass
No I just got out of a medical appr
Appt
She couldn't write both 
:( you are right
But Kitt isn't a good option :( who is the new one
Actually I read back through
And somehow I got the impression that there were 3 c counselors this year, don't know where I got that
Oh wait nevermind
I misread again. Jk
I was scanning for the number 3 instead of the word
I had a good time at work
I actually really like the doctor, he gave me a chinese play to read
That his son translated
It was about this pair that rebels against the bourgeoisie by pretending to be married so they can rent an apartment. The 
landlady's daughter wouldn't accept applications from married people, and the landlady would reject single people. So it was never rented. So the man went in alone, put in his deposit with the daughter, and then met this girl and had her pretend to be his wife to meet the landlady. So they got it.
And then it was implied that they probably were gonna actually get together, it was cute 
And very Maoist 
RE: networking-- were you mocking/satirizing me earlier?
I hope it didn't come across that way :/ I'm sorry if it did.
Very serious though. It started when you told me and I kinda dismissed it until I read an article on Bloomberg with advice from millionaires. Then the practice solidified in my mind after seeing the business card holder.
I didn't take it that way initially, but then I wondered
That makes me sad
:(
I wanna go reading again
I have realized that after work I am tired
And while when we go out I don't get a ton done, it's compared to getting zero done
Plus I mean I like you
*that you grew skeptical of my intentions
Sorry I haven't responded to the other stuff, I will once I get home
Shall I meet you at the library? Or do they close at 8?
Still hate children though lol
Hmm
They do
So 
Idk we could go to somewhere else...
Lemme think
Ok we could go to the U of a library
It is open until 11
I can pick you up
Whenever
That's perfect!!!
You're genius
I can get a ride if it's more convenient 
Lol I just googled "quiet places to study"
And it said public university library
Lol I tried "quiet places in Tucson" and it wasn't great
And I had already tried the health library (closes at 7) so I looked at main again
Great minds think alike
Tbh I thought they would be open until 4am or something because I remember when my mom went to the UA and we got home at 2am
Yeah if you get a ride that would rock
Text me when you arrive
You're already there?
Sweet Caroline by Frank Sinatra
No
I'm gonna leave in like 10
I'm gonna be on the third floor, southwest corner
Alright, On my way! 
ETA?
Btw the third floor is actually only one floor above the lobby
Definitely before 8
7:50 maybe
Here
Most effective attack ad like ever
(I think it sucks, but it killed Michael Dukakis)
And this one where he looks like a deep
Derp
Lil Dicky- ex boyfriend
There's a town in Mexico called Juchitán and it's basically a refuge city for "muxes", Mexico's third gender of people born men but wear women's clothes and makeup and grow their hair out. However, they don't identify with any gender.
Also that was such a pointed attack in very short time! How to kill someone in 40 seconds, hahah.
Lol I love these ads! So much shade
The voice makes everything sound so nonchalant which makes it fucking hilarious 
lil dicky?
 
These are the people I want to read autobiographies about. Or the self made female billionaire in China. 
I think I will write a college essay about the first time meeting my aunt on my dad's side and the disconnect in terms of wealth and language
Talk about how NPR and sperrys meets south Tucson and dirty diners playing rap
Some white trash guy wore a shirt at the store that said "DIE YUPPIE SCUM"
I have goosebumps
Is that a hand?
!!!! :) going to DC 
Burned hand yes
In the interest of your affirmative action I must advise against NPR and sperry's
I <3 my yuppie family
Congrats!!!
Lol Walmart grant
That hand is disgusting. Why does it look netted?
Ok that's fair. Well then I'll have to think of another angle.
What did the doctor end up saying yesterday?
Lol I know but moneyz is moneyzzzzz
There's a roommate preference section. Is gay okay?
It is covered to keep the grafted skin on
It was the nurse practitioner cos the doctor is on vacation
And I don't trust her at all
But she said it was allergies probably. But I don't get allergies
But that's ok
Money HEYY money Wooooo
Lol prolly not
 
 
"I suspect liking licorice is linked to a gene as there ARE countries where people love it - Denmark, Holland, Australia, even Italy. When someone tells me they like licorice except for the black kind, I tell them that other stuff isn't licorice, it's gummy candy."
Lol allergies creating that much of a reaction??? OK!!
She said it could have been a virus at the beginning
And then I was like well then how can it be allergies now...?????
And she was like "oh well, you feel better mostly right? Take a claritin!"
Lol are the pics from tumblr
I read that too and laughed
That's the go-to panacea. "Take a Claritin!"
: Nurse... I think I have cancer
Nurse: Well you feel better, right? Take a Claritin!
Yes hahah!
Soooo how is tonight working
??
So
I can pick you up around 8?
K
8:30
Ok
Probably a bit later b I am so sorry. I was in marana and I didn't realize how far that is
Lolol ok
How much later
20
Bloody hell, mate!
:(
Here
lol ok you could've said 5 min away
Sorry
?? For what
Upsetting you, being a duck
Dick lol
Not fucking you like I said I would
(Though I was planning on it, the mood just became inopportune)
I'm not upset, more that I think we are different people and I have a lot of personal things to learn and discover
It was helpful
I agree that I'm very much a person who thinks my way is the right way, and I'm not happy about that
But it's very hard to change 
I was literally thinking that
But also I don't judge that hard really
And so I think as long as it isn't taken personally, which you do, then it's fine
Ok but when you say things like that it's difficult to tell you something
But that's not your fault
If I thought my way was the way you would hate telling me anything
You would open a discussion and close it just as fast 
Probably would never bring it up again
I disagree
Why would that be the result?
Right, I forget
You would want to see the logic behind my reasoning, etc.
?
Ok idk
It's late
You're probably tired
I'm not mad but there's no need to be mean
What specific thing was mean?
Oh that wasn't you being sarcastic ("Right, I forget, You would want to see the logic behind my reasoning, etc.") and then backpedalling?
No, because it's something you do.
I'm not trying to be mean.
I do think this is pointless.
I am very confused
But also willing to just let it go
That's okay
Because it doesn't matter
Yes
Though I don't appreciate coded communication
But I'm not mad
Do you feel like we just don't get along
I feel like it is true for everyone from time to time so no
🌚🌚🌚
Right, but some people more so than others
Ok goodnight
Also fucking could have been a way to change the mood
Why do you even fucking continue to be with me if I'm disrespectful and not understanding and boisterous and gay 
I really don't understand what you find attractive about a person like me
And I'm just too pissed off right now
Ok yeah that didn't happen
You're cool
Sex is good
Mao it's ok
B ok
Cool
Sorry my phone was dead all morning
After getting past the BS politics, the new Jim Crow is very compelling. I still don't appreciate the focus on extraordinary cases and lack of statistics, similar to the bullshit the media pulls, but basis is fair. I still don't think it's all explicitly or implicitly racially motivated, nor do I blame any specific politicians, but the war on drugs is so fucked up
What's up
will you succ me
Are you a crip
No
For you to say the war on drugs is not at least implicitly racially motivated is kinda ignorant...
The fact that yesterday you assumed Abi's party with xicans would have hard drugs is a pretty strong example
I think it's linked to a disdain for poverty
Which is linked to race but I don't think race is part of the equation 
WELL
her ex-bf supported drugs at Jay's
It was based on that
If not for that I wouldn't have made that presumption
When asked to think of an average drug user, many people tend to think of blacks and Latinos, regardless of clothing (which is usually the indicator of wealth and poverty)
I think of a meth head, white 
And what about marijuana?
White for sure
I don't associate drugs (except maybe crack) with minorities
"Bias plays an important role in this: most Americans now think of colored people when they are asked to imagine a drug user, which leads to discrimination in the criminal justice system "consciously" and "unconsciously.""
Maybe it's not the case for you but it is for many other people
They are real assumptions and stereotypes
But also
It's not a fucking disdain for poverty either, because In that case explain Wall Street to me
Explain coachella or any other music festival
I don't think a bias is equivalent to an explicit motivation to hinder black progress
And people at Coachella don't get prison time :P
I think the racial profiling
And all the police tactics are deplorable
And those have been upheld by the federal government. But I don't think anyone any step of the way has had racial motivation. Except the cops.
I don't think the main motivation is to hinder black/Latino progress though. I think people just assume that black/Latino people will grow up to be criminals and that getting them off the streets will 'lead them on the right path' and off of drugs
And even their's is misguided--- they think they can get more arrests and convictions (which bring money to their department) if they go after minorities. And while minorities don't commit more drug crime, they are less able to fight allegations.
When movies advertise black and Latino lives as those of crime and drug use and violence there is a clear stereotype that officials in the federal government feel obligated to suppress 
And most of those movies are spearheaded by Latino and black directors...
One thought though that comes into my mind is the Al Capone defense, which I can't confirm as true:
That many homicides in ghettos go unsolved. It is not debatable that african Americans commit more violent crime. Because of the disdain for snitching, people aren't caught. So they go after people who they know to be bad on what they can catch them for-drug crimes.
I'm not saying that's the right thing to do, but I would like to know how often this is the case
So you're saying that convicting minorities is a way of getting more $$$ by exploiting how uneducated they are???
Yes absolutely
Which is awful
Police departments should not have financial interest in arresting people
"According to the US Department of Justice, blacks accounted for 52.5% of homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008, with whites 45.3% and "Other" 2.2%. The offending rate for blacks was almost 8 percentage points higher than whites, and the victim rate 6 times higher. Most homicides were intraracial, with 84% of white victims killed by whites, and 93% of black victims killed by blacks."
It's not like the white homicide rate is SIGNIFICANTLY lower
Nearly 50/50
Ummmm
You very much misinterpreted
Let me get my statistics together one DRC
Sec
Ok then explain
And also the Latino/black directors may spearhead the material but unless you're in that loop you most likely will not hear about it 
A study from the DOJ
7.6x more likely to commit a homicide as compared to whites
It is unpopular to look at offending rate because it is politically incorrect
Actually, I see your point. My fault was in the fact that I wasn't taking into consideration the differences in population.
Right
50/50 split, but only 13% of the population is black, and 75% is white
Also if you look specifically at young black males, the rate is incredible (as compared to young white males or the population as a whole)
It is hard to come by the statistics because it is politically painful, but I will find it
You usually see the victim rate
Because that is palatable 
Written by a black professor at Columbia
And I'm not gonna say the drug war has been fair-- it hasn't
But the idea that white America is just as criminal is just not true. Maybe in relation to drugs. And maybe that means they should be held just as accountable for their drug use. But are violent crime rates the same? Hell no. And we should be working on fixing that too.
Young black males commit murder at 14x the rate of young white males
And I think I read it is 37.6x higher than the national average murder rate
And I'm not saying that's a justification for these drug laws and police militarization. I just wish this book acknowledged the origins of the crime problem inherent to some inner city communities
It's painful to look at and necessary to confront, but I guess the harassment of innocent civilians by the police force and the overwhelming amount of blacks/latinos(what category are they under?? Doesn't say anything on the description for under) is just shocking and needs to be explained
There was a correction I found that said many reports included Latinos under white
Not for the one you sent but an earlier one I found
Does it talk about the introduction of crack and other hard drugs to minorities?
But the fact is that the police harassment is very overrepresented in media. It seems so common because you see it all the time on TV, but it's not nearly that common. That said, it's not ok and yes it needs to stop. But let's not look at the crime problem, and then say "but police" and disregard
If you took only non-Hispanic whites the disparity would be larger
What do you mean about the introduction?
The reason people bring attention to white-on-black crimes more than black-on-white is because of the unfair legal action taken... Also I think that the movement is sheltering people from the harsh reality of black violent crimes
RE: your article
Regarding the Al Capone defense, a good example is your uncle. He was convicted of a relatively minor crime but the fact is he was involved in a lot of deep shit, it was just that he was only caught with financial crimes. 
Al Capone, a known murderer, was imprisoned on tax evasion. This book would count him as a non-violent offender. 
I think the movement is trying to make the black community look good, and no lesser than any other.
Yeah, when the CIA and DEA agents circulated cocaine throughout LA to fund the anti-communist movement in Nicaragua
So even this book doesn't push that idea
In fact it is not that explicit at all
The idea was that a few CIA agents overlooked it and allowed it to go on 
And that one of the early dealers was being paid by the CIA, but was not an employee, for some reason linked to the Contras
The fact that this (radical) book does not pursue that path tells me it is not a legitimate conspiracy theory
It does say crack fucked shit up
But the CIA link is very shaky to non-existent. I read this Brown Political Review interview with the biggest and first big crack dealer in LA  at the time
And the way he put it, crack was a brilliant invention, and if not him, someone else would have been dealing it. It was inevitable from his perspective. Didn't need a CIA push
Wait ok quick question
Can we meet up today
Please
And read
We can do black crown
Like now
Or sometime soon
It's just that I'm home alone and I want to be productive today. I'll explain.
I'm not ignoring what you have to say though, I promise
Yeah that's cool. 
I'll head over
Ok let me know when you're leaving
I'm gonna shower first and I'm cleaning up the house a bit
I'm leaving
Do you plan on coming in for a few minutes
Pls don't dleep baby
What
Are you going to sleep
I was trying to say don't go to dleedon't 
Sleep
YOUR NOISES WERE SEXY
you kept talking and talking
saying very nice things
❤️❤️❤️ u fuckd good
Hate it when u think u gotta shit and then you put urself at risk of getting hemorrhoids
Boston gays in 1773: OMG YAAAAAAASSSS, spill that tea HUNTY!!!!
I shoulda fucked wit u during ur Tess-era when you were super gay
Lol wasn't this supposed to be picnic day
Omg the video
U wish I was super gay?
Whoops
Lol he a gay mormon
The endless fashion knowledge might have been annoying but it would have been a different side
You were more gay last year
It's been a journey to straightness :P 
🌚
❤️
🐢
🍆
One last video!!
🆒
I swear
You'll be happy
Please watch
With audio
Thx 
I can't stop laughing
Ok
🌚😘💖🙏
I don't think Kitt is staying at tucson north
Who were you assigned for CC?
OMG perfect for your mom!
BASIS didn't prepare me for this :(
Lol
Wat
Hey could you send some good photos of me. I need one for my student ID
Thx
 
With a light background?
 
Thx b I got it
FU
❤️
Hey I'm all done now
Why don't you think Kittredge is staying??? I got him originally but because he's such an ass I asked for billings.
You checked his reddit, didn't you?
Lol you didn't hear yet? She signed up for an Arab dating site last month.
It's so weird to me that you don't have an essential profile/ID pic
I have many many many potential pics
What even is that OFFENSIVE article??? Where did you find it??? Explain yourself????
Yeah he's moving to Chandler
(I feel pretty guilty tbh)
When!!!!!
Like now I think
Don't mention my source to anyone 
I can say I found out on my own from reddit lol
Lol it is by the author of this slate article I read. I looked her up and that's what came up
Lol if you're comfortable with that
Oh my god that sex module!!! Is there a link to it? Can you email?
It's like sims gone wild and verbal
It was literally 45 minutes
I wanted to die
Sorry b
It's a paid program
Like you need a student log in
Demo video
How was work
Werk
Twerk
I'm holding off to send you a pic of my great mature lunch
I've been "cooking"
Tomato soup and grilled cheese lol
One of my favorite combinations
That's lame. One would expect the "future" to involve real actors raping each other. Make the sexual harassment experience more appeasing and interactive rather than scare the shit out of students.
You didn't have fun choosing your own path?! Hahahah
What if you fail
Work was great! All my coworkers are so sweet and they say "hi new guy!!!!" every time they see me. Training and reading manuals was a bore though. I'll tell you about it when I see you
Fuck... Kitt got genital herpes from his wife
What a cute meal
I agree. I wish it was more real. I just made the "right" choice each time because I thought I was being graded or otherwise monitored. I never got to hear their answers to my actual concerns :(
It was super way too far feminists
Feminist-y
All right
things I never wanted to know
Ok
??
What's wrong ;(
Sorry, I'm just out
I haven't had time to sit and really reply b
Lol I'm just joking
I just thought it would be funny
What's up today
What're you doing tonight
I just read and watched house of cards today
Plan is to keep reading wbu? What did you do today after work
I think I just saw your mom with your car lol
That's very possible
She's out with my car
Where she at
And where you at
Hey, I just got home from hanging w Priscilla 
Anthony has a boyfriend!
We went to copper country, buffalo exchange, urban outfitters, and some vietnamese pho place
She was at country club and speedway turning onto CC
Yeah! In the demo informational video it said that you could see your score compared to other students.. Which is kinda freaky. Like what if yours is low? Do you get in trouble or something? What if you don't take it seriously?
What were your actual concerns?
There was this funny quote from my savers training video. Remind me to tell you hahahah
They were really easy questions-- it was clear what they wanted, but I could imagine some students answering how they actually feel, leading to lower scores
I got 💯
But also during the videos they would ask you "like or dislike" and it would tell you the percent of students from Brown who gave each answer
Some were like 99.67% and 0.33%
Who is he?
Did you have a good time
Did you ever end up meeting up with anthony
I don't know if anything happens if you fuck up the post test
But I also didn't want to take any chances
Or risk like a session with a counselor there telling me about sex assault
Ooh good for you. So certain answers were only half right or three fourths right or something?
Compelling article
It's kinda stupid though because for each situation one way is not the only right way. Everything depends on what the person feels comfortable with and whatnot.
No no, I mean that very few students deviated 
It's not up to you to make a judgement call on sexual harassment.
It was an aggregate
Like 99.67% answered one way, 0.33% the other way
Eh, it was structured to be pretty agreeable. At least the times they asked questions were at agreeable times 
 
That's the boy. A psychology major at Kenyon... Lol
aning No future together
They kind of look similar
In a weird way
And he looks str8
Cute dinner too? :P
Yeah I had fun! No, he kept asking if I wanted to meet for coffee or do Common app stuff but I'm too tireddddddd
My thoughts on possibly driving through Cleveland
Did you have fun today?
They do, I thought the same thing too
No your dinner is not cute sorry. Too few interesting colors
And the fish looks burnt
Jk
Yeah I had funny kinda
I was thinking about it and I think the odds of me graduating college a democrat are scary high
It's weird that fat people have normal sized feet 
It kinda freaks me out
I wouldn't be surprised if Diviya got married before 30, impulsively. 
Or Martha, if she ever manages to get past the 1 month mark
Or Jay
I think he would marry a stripper just cod
Cos
Like while drunk
Or something
And then laugh about it
You obviously never saw Kim's pregnancy feet 
Also it freaks me out too. 8th and 9th grade was basically me wondering how Christian Daahir existed and how his tiny legs/feet could support such a massive torso. Probably what fucked me up. He looked like a big chicken.
Omg ew
I want to vomit 
Btw I'm sorry I haven't been replying b
My head hurts so bad ;(
I am falling asleep
Oh ok good night feel better
Sorry
<3
Please send interesting articles and thoughts and pictured and anything for me to look at when I wake up at 1am feeling better lol
Cute thighs on new bedding btw ok lol
Also I always thought Carly in iCarly was such a bitch about giving Neville that shitty ass "new" car bc her reasoning was, "it's new to you"
Omg Jay would be that guy who accidentally married the Filipina
Martha's expectation IS marriage before 30
I think about the odds of you becoming a democrat too or like passionate about some cause
"We're not Detroit" lol
I expected Cleveland to be some boring ass cracker city
Why youu textin me boi? You feelin' betta?
I am the worst person when it comes to imagining other states or cities
Who knew Kentucky had forests?????!?!!!!
Not me
Lol.....
I mean it hurts but I tried Falling asleep and I can't
I'm not tired
Also I missed you
I am the same way about imagining places. I almost always have some mental image based on nothing
:(
Take an Advil?
Or something
Speaking of which, hahaha: 
That was stupid
Sorry to waste your time
Ok but it's fair to assume that would be the terrain... Idk. I know Louisiana/Florida marshes and swamps.  
I liked the video 
We don't keep that in the house lol. The best cure is to DIEEESE
Go buy some?
I can smuggle you some
I saw this yesterday and wanted to send it
You would do that!
How sweet of you
It's only a headache
I actually eat pluots a lot
In the summer
Also I've been thinking and we should do either a cool picnic or a nice dinner for you leaving and my belated birthday, I guess, but mainly your leaving
!!!
I didn't even know it was a thing.......
I assume everywhere that isn't desert-y or farm is pretty but I think I'm deluded
Mostly your birthday
#dad'sanagronomist
#whitebenefits
Awww are you touching yourself right now:(
I thought we were gonna do a thing today
No I'm not
Good👏👏👏
I just wanted to maintain the streak of snaps
 don't fool yourself I did like 4 times today
You've been pretty active lately, I'm impressed
Snap active
You screenshotted one?
Snaptive
Can you send it?
At first I read it "dad's anagronomist"
I'm laughing
But you can't tell
I can't believe of all pictures you choose that stupid one
With a sad face on my head
For all we know it could be a deformed thumb
It was funny
I guess it's better to have on your phone than anything else bc it's ambiguous
That lady is the head of surgery at UMC 
She has a thick jew accent
And she was the director of SIMI
She always wears this jewelry with question marks on it
It says penis
It is not ambiguous
That lady in the picture???
Is the director of SIMI?!
Why is she in that background
What happened to her
Who would do such a thing
Did you do that with photoshop?!
It's not entirely reductionist, Aimee. The straight boys at least go to school.
I don't know how it happened I just found it on google.
And I meant that you are reducing their individual personalities 
By saying the (true) statement of the things they share
As if because they share that they have no individuality
Idk why he's defending them so much. It's not like we are rejecting our stereotype because it literally is a set of traits we share
Also the things that we associate ourselves with aren't derogatory or offensive
I could understand if there are exceptions, and we do recognize and acknowledge them
Jay's race thing just really pissed me off
We are talking about a clique of 4 people in a high school for christ's sake!!!!
I mean I can say some individual things for them and I guess it's offensive in the "demeaning their complexity as humans" thing but...
You two are really fired up about this...
Did he text you privately too?
Ugh ok nvm
No
Ok
?
Sorry b
I just don't understand 
Understand what?
The anger underlying this argument with jay
Fetty Wap has one eye
Idk I've been upset with his arguments for a few days
How did you find that out haha
Ok anyway idk just forget it
Why is that?
Wikipedia
Is the joke that almost all books are about that and they are so diverse, so why should we box books about minorities into the category of "black-experience"?
My tortoise is determined as fuck
❤️🐢
I prevent her from going somewhere and she still has hope and keeps pushing on
The joke is that all literature is basically written by white males and that she shouldn't even be asking for help since it's everywhere  
Not diverse,
The problem is the underrepresentation of black literature 
Oh I thought it was nuanced
That was my first assumption
At first I thought it was making fun of the way people suddenly took interest in the black experience since it's always existed
Awwww that's so cute
I like trailing my finger in front of your tortoise and making her follow it
Or trailing anything
Yes please
She is such a cutie
Hahaha
You know it's very affirming how into the P you are
Affirming for yourself?
I'm buying a bunch of political pins right now
Are you asleep? :(
Okay well goodnight
🌚🌚🌚
Sorry b I fell asleep
Judge bitch
This is the kind of shit in New Jim Crow
We failed that long ago
And the privileged Khloe kardashian or Paris Hilton run free and drink all the booze they want as they drive
Ok actually so far I don't understand why she would get pulled over and why the cop would feel the need to use the breathalyzer 
Oh it isn't a race thing
She was speeding
I thought your Jim Crow intro meant it would. E
38 in a 25
No
Just that it is unreasonable probation
That is so fucking depressing
Another sad thing, kinda unrelated, is how disabilities usually result in poverty
Disabilities get pretty good social security
Livable for sure
Lol it's not as easy as you think
If something unexpected happens there's no backup plan
People end up moving to section 8 housing bc they can't afford the mortgage
The poverty rate for working-age people with disabilities is nearly 30%
The disability check is nothing compared to the life they had before lol
There's no mobility
Only down
Sometimes literally
Ok sure but it's not extreme poverty. It's lower middle class
Sorry that's how it be
They aren't productive
They shouldn't be awarded
20 turtles fighting for food
You can't really see it in the video but it was crazy
There were literally 20+
Alex: do you want to take a turtle [out of the water] until it dries out?
Where is that
I want to go there
Silly alex
It's at fort Lowell
What did you feed the turtles
Don't kill me... Idk if this is ok or not
White bread...............
That's horrible
Like really truly awful
That said the turtles there are of an invasive species
So it doesn't really really matter
So they need to die
But still don't do that
Turtles are not fish
They eat real food
My grandpa said it was ok
He's the turtle expert?
I knew I should've consulted you first
It did attract 30 turtles though
It's like feeding a kid marshmallows or cake or something except worse
Of course they like it
It's ok though just never again
Now that I think of it, it's like feeding a gay bread... Omg I can't believe it. That comparison hit me the hardest.
How's you doing bb boy
Did you read the thing about how squidward is a POC
The new tumblr thing is analyzing the POCs in children's shows we grew up watching
Fresh SJW shit this week!!!
It's funny how you still have to go back to school shopping hahah
Want to go shopping tonight?
Sorry b I will answer the rest soon I am reading
Ok no worries
Ya boy. I also got a panera gift card we can get some good eats
Gr8 what time
When does the mall close
8 I think
Oh nvm, 9pm 
 Ok when should I come to you
Ugh hold on my grandpa is getting pissed bc I said I don't have to go to scouts
? :((((((
There is literally an amateur baseball team called the "liberal bee jays"
I love bee jays
Where do you want to do shopping
Hahahah
Is it a school team?
Park place
Maybe tucson mall if you feel like it
Is it gonna work out tonight
Would tomorrow be better?
It's just that I won't get out until 8:30
We could read tonight
I'm sorry :(
Tomorrow won't work. Actually I don't think any time until Sunday will
But that's ok
:(
Yeah we can read
Okay!!!!
I'm gonna head over there now cos the library closed but don't feel rushed
Ok I'll be out now
Light is on in my car so it should be easy to find
?
Accepted to brown ED!! Fuck!!!!!!
Also lol @ this
See that's the kind of thing I think you could benefit from
That guy is comparable to you except the shit high school
I can take a good picture of you
If you let me
Which one did you use?
I took my own I think the problem was that the background had a bit of a gradient. I'm gonna photoshop
Also I didn't get into a biology techniques class because my skills are too advanced. Lol I'm ok with that
I can literally take a good pic of you. You've seen what I could do for Reyna.
Also got my license lol
Wow
Seriously?! That's fucked up.
I didn't think you would
Jk
Congrats
I wouldn't be okay with that
I mean you're going to brown...??? What the fuck do they mean too advanced for that??
It means I know how to do all the lab things they teach I guess
Which makes me sad cos it must be such an easy class
Texts I need from you
Hahahahahaha
Do you have any new thoughts on last night? I'm torn between "who else could it be" and "that's unlikely"
How does it feel to be on your last day of summer
How does it feel to not respond over text
Jk
I'm sorry
I try to not reply when you're working bc I don't want to distract you for a long period of time
I'm not working today
Until 1:20
Oh! What have you been doing?
Reading a bit, house of cards, Internet 
Wbu
Was the biology techniques class separate from the phagocyte class?
Yes thank god
He speaks English on his own terms. He knows what words mean, but when you ask him what he ate for lunch or how his day was he either makes something up or says he doesn't know
It's bacteriophage not phagocyte. Phagocytosis is when a cell engulfs a microbe and eats it
He's 12.5% Filipino
How old is he
He got the eyes
4?
I could read chapter books at 4 :(
My mom played Mozart to me while she was pregnant cos it was supposed to foster brain development
I think I told you that
Caught you
What do you mean by "that's unlikely"? I keep thinking about it, but I think I wouldn't freak out about something like that unless we fuckin and I see a hand on the window or something  
You're too funny today with this texting stuff
I'm actually laughing
My last day of summer is unfulfilling 
I mean it's unlikely someone would call and they would get there relatively quickly 
Ill probably go to gym
:(
Or we could do lunch or something idk
Sorry b I don't have my car
Now that I can driiiiiive
!!!
I can drop you off at hospital
Ya?
Let me see how long it takes me to get ready
You're scared huh
I don't think it's realistic time-wise at this point but it's a great idea 
Oh actually no
It won't work
I need to drive to my lesson at 5:30 so I need my car to be there so I need to wait for it to arrive
Awwww :( okay well, another day
Today I got my license and I've been voluntarily babysitting all morning, waiting to leave lol.
He's 5 :/ since he can't read my mom has him doing phonics on the Internet with those websites lol
I swear to god he's gonna break my Mac... She lets him use it all the time and my keyboard and trackpad are fucked up
You never told me about baby Aimee and Mozart! That's adorable haha
Also very upper middle class
I told my mom to do the same but NOOOOOOO
noooOOOOOOHHHH
I was actually born into the middle class excuse you
Is he gonna go to kindergarten
lol
Yawning
I'm driving without shoes and I feel ghetto
No, by texting me while driving you won't initiate bad habits. I promise.
How old were you until the ascension to upper middle class happened
*when
Basis kindergarten starts tomorrow!!!! I'm excited to record the results
Like 12-14
Yay go him. I hope he doesn't get expelled 
It's gonna be depressing bc all the kids in his senior class will have gone to elementary and middle school with him
They're gonna hate leaving each other
Or love each other
Gil and I have been in school together since 2nd grade and its fine
And Veris since preschool but not in the same grade since middle school
Ok yeah but if you were friends with Gil in 2nd it would be a different story
like from 2nd-12th
He's unimportant to your life
  
Vacuum cleaner
The right way to suck dick
Well then have a good time at work!
Thx b
LOL
and apparently I look asian cod everyone thought I was Veris's mom's son
Cos
Very sad how we more or less have segregation in the schools here
Or at least there are definitely shit schools full of poor people, and the opposite. But given free school choice, it seems people are willing to let their kids go to shit schools... (Buses are available for all I believe)
I read a thing in the newspaper about a shortage of teachers for TUSD because they make less than 35k
That article is so sad though.
"Another is that parameters set long ago by the Supreme Court prevent the busing of students beyond a school district’s boundaries as a remedy for segregation." :(
Veris's mom could be half white
When I went to a TUSD school the teachers and principal told my mom I belonged somewhere better...
How did it go btw!!!
What's up with you now?
Beebz I'm sorry I was working at the farm today
I also went to gym
Lol jk
She has a heavy accent though. 
What TUSD school did you go to again? 
It went pretty good but it was a bit depressing I can't go into specifics
How was your day eventually 
I'm sorry :( I hope you're feeling better now
Or like the day got better
I went to Erickson elementary
My day was great. Drivers test, got $$$, drove around A LOT, worked out, volunteered. The alcohol hookup apologized to me. She got creeped out by jay lol. 
My day felt so long
I can't believe I did everything I did today
Also went school shopping kinda
I cleaned my closet
I found a note Reyna wrote me. I remember I was like "I love you more man, Kesha loves gluten?!"
What did you do at the farm?
Does Kesha love gluten
Lol that says "than" not man. Or is that the joke
You did so much
Lol bitch u took ur sweet time too so don't even rn
Excuse you I was taking care of my family friend who had 2 serious medical procedures
And all the people in the rehab ward by sending positive Energy
Ok now I feel really terrible...
:(
What happened to her? What's the latest
Does she have any family members who are staying with her or something? :(
She's fine it was just some unpleasant routine things
And from time to time but not consistently
At ze farm zhennifer and I ran the entrance to the farmers market. Handed out samples of fuckin awesome roasted bell peppers (I ate 30?) and encouraged people to enter a farm raffle lol. It's very lax and we talk the entire time. Although today was packed!!! 60,000+ people saw the farm FB post
It really says "I love you more than Kesha loves glitter"
 Did she have the procedures recently?
60K?!? Impossible
Yes one today one end of last week
Also Martha's boyfriend was at the farm running the worms/compost station
Yeah that's what the PR girl told us
How old is she again?
Today the doctor said that she was amazed at how few pills this guy in his 70s took, and he took like 6 a day. I was shocked that that's below Norma
Normal
Omg every morning my grandpa takes like 13
Sometimes they fall on the floor and stuff
It's so depressing
She is 65
Alcohol hookup on the top right
What's blue and not very heavy?
A depressed caterpillar 🐛
Light blue :O
A depressed ant 🐜
Lol I think depressed insects are more cute
Depression is cute?
For the sake of the joke, yes
We found this stupid flower that smelled like cucumbers and it looks like I'm blessing her with it
It looks like
She's concerned because your face got stuck
And in the first one she's happy you got unstuck
Aimeeeeeee!!!! 💐🐭👅
You little nugget
I'm glad ur alive
Have the best night ever!!!!
Follow your dreams
Good night
Wear foundation at least once
Wow, okay...
I'll sleep through my dreams
Oh I thought that's what you were saying
"Have the best night ever"
Nah bitch you gotta wake up when ur dreaming and follow the dream
I have worn foundation :O
I looked like Luka when I wore it
Ok yeah I was saying goodnight but yours was lame so I didn't want to leave just yet
🌚🌚🌚🌚 screw you ❤️
Have the best first day ever
May your dreams be golden with Klimt 🌝
Wasn't that beautiful? Trademarked!!!
What did you suggest I write my common app on again?
Finding out your dad wasn't you dad
Oh yeah. Have a good day!
You too! Happy first day!!
Hey b how's it going?
I had probably the best day ever. I'm really happy.
This looks trashy, right? The new drama teacher pulls these eyebrows off so good. She looks like Morticia from Addams family hahah and she has a septum piercing and other piercings too
So well
What are you doing in veris's mom's lab?
*doing shadowing her
This looks trashy, right? The new drama teacher pulls these eyebrows off so good. She looks like Morticia from Addams family hahah and she has a septum piercing

Omg when I see you I have to tell you the Kittredge quote
He's so sweet btw!!
You've got to do what you've got to do, love 😘
Also the mountain is on fire and as fucked up as this sounds, it looks really pretty
Tell me about Kitt
I couldn't see the fire
I'll tell you about introductions when I see you because they're too funny to get over text. But Kitt was like, "you might think I'm the biggest asshole and I might be, but for this class I'm going to give you my all. You guys are my priority and I'm going to write the best letters for each of you. You will all get into college, I have no doubt about it"
"It's okay if you need to come into my office and cry"
A super reassuring guy. We are starting the UA application tomorrow.
Today I learned about cytocele. When a bladder herniates out of the vagina 
I cringed 
Come to coffee with me and Reyna tomorrow?
There are too many things you say you will say in person and then we forget
Just dictate it!
:)
  
And the social justice warriors in the room go silent....
Why wouldn't I?
I didn't know hernias occurred for women
Idk busy or something 
What
Hernia?
  
I know... But I didn't know women could have hernias. Like I didn't know where it would come out.
Where would it come out for men?
And it doesn't have to come out-- it can just protrude into another organ or whatever
Balls
What 
You are going to have to explain this to me
Tomorrow
I'll meet you at black crown? Or pick you up?
I'm taking car tomorrow
Again
You're not working tomorrow?
I am working
K
Ok good night then! I am 💩ed
Ok we'll talk about it tomorrow then
Goodnight
🌚🐅🛀
How accurate would you say the acceptance rate calculator is on unigo?
Not at all
Ok cool
What did it say
21% for Brown lol
I was like ummmmmm no
 I think I got 48% it told me
Might have been another website but I think it was unifo
Unigo
Predictors are silly
48% for you sounds accurate though. Your essays are what brought you to the 100%.
No but you see
It gave me 48% for like every school
I definitely had better odds than that some places
I got 70%-99% for some schools
Tufts was 9%
Maybe it just hasn't been  well set up yet 
Ok see
In no world could tufts be 9 and brown be 22
That's not realistic at all
Oh ya I know
What's the shower thing
He used to record his shower times (he broke it with Elizabeth though!!) to not be late to school, but now it's not a concern
Are u ok?
Ya
Why
Idk you've just been weird
But that's fine
My mom this morning: your breakfast is organic so it's good
: ok ya but what is it lol
I also had a stupid dream about you
 too!
About me? Lol
Or yourself hahaha
Her: organic, I already told you!
You
You were taking a clothed shower with Reyna at my house without consulting me and you excluded me. And also some mom was in the bathroom with you guys 
I'm laughing rn omg
The mom part killed me
I also had an exclusionary dream that made me jealous :(
We were invited to Saskia's first party at her new house and I was gonna drive there and we would meet up. When I got there you brought Oscar and you two kept talking and excluding me. Then you touched his butt and thought I wouldn't see and I was like UHHHUHHHH
Also the other part of the dream was that Byroad (cool, hot drama teacher who, now that I think of it, looks like Alex Vause) came to Jay's party and had sex with students
The shower thing would never happen though
Yeah you would never shower clothed lol
Lol that reminds me that Reza tried to tell me yesterday that he fucked a teacher and so did his friend because they needed better grades. And I was like "sure" and he more or less silently conceded
And I'm sorry
I don't even think oscar is cute so
And he's kinda boring too
Lol you actually think I would shower with Reyna
Who do you think I am
I wouldn't do it while we're still together and I wouldn't do it voluntarily. Maybe if I was drunk and we both got vomit on us the most I would do is take turns while in the same bathroom.
........
I mean at that kind of school would you really not believe that?
Ok if there's anything you should listen to it's the new This American Life. Very relevant to our discussions and what you're reading, and also it gets personal and heartbreaking 
Tbh I'd probably shower with a mom
Think of all the people who bought this.... 
"It's healthy though!"
I'll check this american life out
Lol that water wtf
Wtf
I dunno the nude photo shoot is pretty close
What was breakfast
For a second I thought it was that water
WF pulled it off the shelves eventually haha
What's the story
How do you feel about that? Does it make you uncomfortable?
Did you find it on the Internet
Breakfast was oatmeal with berries and quinoa, a veggie sausage patty, and French toast
It was pulled because people made fun of the product since it's literally asparagus in water
Aimee I miss you and I can't wait to see you 💖
I will see you later, have a great day!!!
See you!!
But still answer my things lol
Oh
A bit uncomfortable. It's like if Bella Ruhl and I did that, but a bit less because she liked me
And breakfast sounds dynamic
Wtf
So many dead baby photos. But I spared you. This is only a placenta
Infected
What's the plan
Do u want to pick me up or should I drive there?
?
I can pick you up
Sorry my phone had died
I'll come by around 6:20
Is a little later ok?
When? 
Like 6:45
It's just that I'm not home yet
Ok I can take my car if it's problematic 
Not at all
Sorry I was working on something that's why I didn't respond
Be there in 10
Ok thanks for letting me know
Here
Hor
Hot
sXe
secksi
haht
Did you originally know about the second "birth"? (When the female also has to push placenta out too)
*placenta out
R u going to bed now
Sorry I was looking for cool shit to send
What
No the persons pronoun is sXe lol 
Those chicks in the vid are engaged :O
How did you find xreligiousxvomitx?! Lol that's someone I follow
You sent me...
The vid from that tumblr
Ohhhh right
Sorry the pics
Yeah so after the baby is born the mom still has to push out the placenta
I didn't know these were the qualifications 
 
Lol @ both
Why aren't you asleep lol
Too fucked?
Is that a thing
Ya
Sometimes I enjoy the fucking so much that I can't stop thinking
Good! If you stop thinking you die
Oh you mean you can't go to sleep
Hum
❤️❤️❤️ good night 
It's nice to stop thinking sometimes hahah. When I jerk the twerk I go mind numb 35% of the time
Goodnight bbbb!!! seeing you today made me very happy 💖😍🌚
I remember what I was going to say! The gender fluid / NB way for Latinos to identify is "latin@" 
Hey how was your day
That's basically me every time I drink some healthy smoothie though, lol
Alex to mom: "guess what! My mom died. Oh! You're my mom"
Did you see the comments after that Boy Scouts joke hahaha!
 Today Morgan was like, "I have the snap chat of this very hot gay guy who lives in NYC if you want it" and then I said I was in a relationship and he said "the guy doesn't care. At my drama camp this summer he was making out with everyone. Even he's in a relationship with a guy who works on Wall Street!"
Also Martha got pissy about leadership roles. She's starting her own club - medical research club - and doesn't want Diviya to have a leadership position in it
What was your "I'm gay" moment? Can you tell me about it
I'm currently sitting in the savers parking lot waiting for my shift to start and I see this woman go to her car and reach into the tire crevices for her key??? Like she keeps her key out in this weather (windy and raining), lol
Lol Martha
I didn't have an I'm gay miente, did you?
Moment
She does know that becoming a leader in a club that you weren't in the year before in senior year is super suspect 
You are working now
That's sad
Until 10
we can meet up after?
I might get out early
Like very likely
Ya
Yeah so I'm done
I come back tomorrow 2-7
Ok I need a while
Ok I need a while
I'm not doing anything. I got home from bookmans maybe 40 minutes ago.
 There you go
Hi
Sorry I just finished restoring
Ok I guess it's too late now
Hopefully I see you this weekend
And I hope you are not upset
Too late?
Ok well
Why do you think I'm upset??
Nvm actually
Ya I need to finish up some stuff too this iPhone setup took forever
How was your day
I heard about my roommate and dorm
I am gonna be in the lane far away dorm which is sad
But it's a pretty dorm building and it has its own vegetarian cafeteria with ethnic food so that's cool
The guy is from rich Boston suburb and is the most average white male ever
Why is that sad?
That's awesome!!! Are you getting a meal plan or how is that working?
Is that all you know about him?
It's really sad
You're the second person I have been with leaving for college
Anyway, sorry. Ignore that.
I'm sad it's literally a mile from any classes
Yep I think meal plan is mandatory at least for first year for sure
Yeah that's all 
I'm sorry :( soon you will be off too!
Look up on tumblr "thedudewhosadude" 
Can't believe that's your roommate
You could even look him up
Alex hill
Belmont MA
I wanted a cool kid :(
I hope he doesn't like sports
Sadie's boyfriend looks exactly like Joseph...
Exactly
No, the joke was that the tumblr user is your roommate
Nvm
He looks average
Oh lol
Ha but
Ya but
He writes pretty things
And it's interesting idk
It's not that he's hot
He's just so passionate about sex
I got in trouble for being too sexual today in the hallway
I'm not even joking
Or exaggerating
All I was doing was playing with reynas hair
Anyway, I feel like you're going to sleep now or something
I'll read the tumblr
I'm not
Who told you off
There is an important journal called proceedings of the national academy of science But the acronym is
PNAS
I can't believe they could make that oversight
Casler
Ok and again, I am not exaggerating, but the older French silver fox daddy interacts with me and Zayna during lunch and free period in a flirty way. Idk if it's just the way he talks or what but he doesn't make an effort to talk to any other seniors 
What is his job now
I think it's bc I'm the only gay
Casler probably thinks you are straight 
:)
Ok
?
Ok
Sometimes I see things that are remotely sexual and I wonder how people in the company can overlook the implications
No, sorry
Amanda probably filled him in on the gossip sooo I doubt that
Ride the CLITT
I feel like you're just weird today
I'm really not?
What company 
What are you gonna do this weekend
Guess what color my phone is
I tried showing you the bear fisting the other bear on the mountain but u didn't want any of it
Ohhhhhh
I was wondering the color earlier
Probably gold
I'm getting a 6 this October too
Ohhhh?
This means you now have slo mo on your camera
Tomorrow I'm going to a party at night and staying the night
Ya it's gold
I get the sex company thing now
Oh cool where
Did you get a say in the color?
A Ventana canyon suite
What are you doing this weekend?
No church tomorrow btw
Why thanks for the details Sergio
I am going camping with Joseph and Veris
If that means anything to you
Yes I chose it
Yeah that would be cool
I mean my entire family isn't going to church but I am free 
Nvm
???
Oh I thought you meant the house was open 
We can hang though
Are you ok 
You have said nvm like 3 times
No but the thing is that I don't like telling you my problem with you leaving bc it seems like you don't care
You say "well we knew it was coming anyway"
Go ahead let it out
we know when people are dying but it doesn't mean I won't cry the day they do
:(
There's nothing really to say
The process just fucking sucks
I'm still gonna talk to you 
I remember what it was like when Anthony left
And it won't be the same
But it won't be the end, and I hope we will still be close, there is no opposition to that from my end
I know, and I wish it was easy for me to be so okay and supportive of you
And I'm sad and scared too I just function by not crossing the bridge til I get there so I don't worry 
I understand. 
I guess you're right
No no
You should be feeling more than I should
It's just how I am
I am trying to explain why I may seem to be dismissing you but I'm not
For yourself going off to college and starting your life
Oh okay
I mean I was the same way with Anthony
I just function differently. I respect your way and you don't need to change
I didn't think about it before too much but I fucked myself over because I had unrealistic expectations while it was happening
The same way - how you are now
How so
It was sad because I didn't make a big deal about it and we still maintained feelings, but eventually things deteriorated and we stopped talking altogether
Idk
Anyway, it's Zayna's birthday party tomorrow. I don't want to go because Joanna and her friends are going to be there.... 
They all judge us hardcore for drinking
It's like josh except for everything
Oh. Well that sounds fun. 
If you want to talk about this in person I'm open to that. 
I really hope it doesn't bother you or annoy you though
I'm fine but the thoughts come randomly. It's something that on a normal day I wouldn't think too much about.
Why don't you guys rent some horses and ride them while high
Lol there is nothing out there
One thing I admire about you is how much more confident you are now about your body. It was so amazing the first time you took off your shirt and went swimming
Nothing at all
Like with the boys
Also I'm not gonna smoke
It doesn't both me
It was very Aimee-zing
I'm glad you say that... It stresses me out
But I also don't want to wear a swim shirt and be soggy so
Like they were all so comfortable and supportive about it
I was really proud of you
I think I more or less made sure to stay in the water or be covered lol
But yeah
Haha you're not going to smoke? So you're saying you will just pass up the numerous joints that Veris and Joseph will be taking like pros?
Yep
I'll watch
That NEVER goes well
For anyone lol
Peer pressure is stronger than we think
😎
#thanksaimee
#summercorruption
Fucking up juniors since 2014
😎
Did anyone mention it? The swimming 
Covering the red, high eyes with dem shades
Yeah Jennifer and Joseph talked bout it
👀
But they were also surprised too
👀
Like it was a life event for the Facebook account
Oh my god the first time I touched you
And we were completely naked
I was really weirded out but not in a bad way when the bandages came off
Basically I'm so happy for everything you do
It was like whoa
I know!!!! I remember the first pics haha and you showed your mom
You know the scars are really fading. Still very present now but I do have faith that within a year or so they won't be visible
I got you that bio oil you only used twice
Yeah I might start that
Stopped with the scar tape it was a lot of maintenance 
What did they even say
Is the scar tape the tape that kept coming off in the pool hahah
What did your doctor say on scarring?
Jennifer just told me they talked about the moment for a while and said it was awesome to see you not give any fucks and to just get in the water
I think he said I'm young so it'll be chill
Today in physics
The teacher was like, "yeah the telescope at NAU was the one to discover Pluto"
Then Chris goes, "so... You know this for a fact?"
It was very funny. These stories are not so funny over text :(
Making the research class has been a daily goal of mine
Today Nathaniel was contributing to class discussion and he said "our papers need to have minimal flaws" and Rosinbum said "it's impossible to have a perfect paper"
Then I was like "you've clearly never read my research papers then"
IT WAS VERY FUNNY OKAYAYYAYYYY
"If I wear my poetry genius shirt and people don't know what it is I'm just gonna look like an asshole"
"I look vaguely Latino"
*reaearch class laugh has been
OK!
I won't pretend to get it but if you say so
Just so you in
Know*
In works too I guess
My tortoise's common names are lumpy and hooper
Depending on how I'm feeling
Or pooper if she poops
I released air but in the way where you're kinda laughing. Like when you see/hear something really cute. Like seeing little baby animals lick their paws.
Because hooper is too cute of a name
I love how each name is dependent on certain feelings 
My mom does the same thing
Alex becomes Trumpy once Fox News comes on
Omg Richie was onion patch because he always smelled like shit
And my mom calls me big butt
Then she spanks me
Has your tortoise mastered the art of soccer yet?
Lol omg trumpy
Send that to the chat
You have an Oedipus complex big butt?
Ya I called in a favor and had messi come down. She won 
One day a decade or more from now Alex is gonna realize trumpy 
Who told you about my Oedipus complex
Lol you could hire some local chicanos to play
She'd probably get the best training from that
The only time Palestinian kids are useful
Them too
When I was younger I wanted to fuck my dad and run away with him, even though he was an asshole
I thought that was weird until I found out it's pretty common
Do you have any experience the Oedipus complex 
*eith the
They're also good for use as human shields to create sympathy for terrorists in western audiences 
I do not have that experience
Lol I was trying to keep it consistent with the tortoise soccer theme
But those are literally the two stereotypes
It seems like every country but America has kids who play soccer lol
And Canada too
Except like 
Canada
Or China 
Or India
Or Korea
No, I feel like the more impoverished the more likely to play it
It's either soccer or milk cows lol
"India"
India is pretty impoverished
Makeup damn
In the same way I imagine citizens of Kentucky and Tennessee to be hicks I imagine skinny Indian/African kids kicking around coconuts
Indians play cricket
Dominicans play baseball
Get with the culture
Oh I also call the tortoise TZ
pronounced TeeZee
oh thanks for the clarification, man. I thought it was pronounced TehhZee.
ATZ break? You? . Mimi.
Poor Indians play cricket?!
"Dominican republicans"
I remember you said that
AZT but I appreciate the joke
Azidothymidine 
Ok the Asians without makeup look really derpy and like 3/10 but then makeup BAM
It's like cute to damn slay
Don't say slay I
K?
I knew it was wrong but I wanted to keep the TX
TZ
But I agree hahaha
Is slay too gay
No it's like... Failed gay
Cos it's last year
Wow look at you
That's shockng to hear 
What are new gay things that they say
There haven't been any recent gay developments
The movie stonewall is coming out soon but it was spearheaded for whitewashing 
When I imagine you being friends with Tess and Panteha I imagine this super gay junior who knew all his fabrics and textile designs 
Sorry b you missed that train 
 I got a gold iPhone as I said so maybe it's a new era
#duggar
Or like black father 
Yeah regardless I'm not planning on seeing it
Really though, anyone who makes a big budget gay movie about protest should know that they won't succeed
Because protest-y people inevitably find things to bitch about
Maybe I shouldn't talk to you for two weeks to see what gold iPhone 6 life does to you
Exactly!!!
There are always representation issues
Even if it were perfect they would be like "Hollywood is capitalizing off the struggle cow it's popular now"
Even with movies like Selma and whatever
It was supposed say "since" not cow
People get upset because it's not a perfect portrayal 
Sergio good talk
I'm sleepy
I think it's just funny that this guy thinks that now is the right time to release a movie like tha
Ya
Okaaaay
🌚❤️🐢🇮🇱😴
👬
Fuck yes new update!!!!!
You can now see black emojis 
💂🏿
👮🏿
🎅🏿

🌚🌺🙇🏽🐰🐸👨‍❤️💋‍👨🍑
💖💖💖💖💖💖
Is that flower a...
I actually think the idea of that as a flower is really hot
lol what do you become at 11:08 pm
We needed black angels to protect society since black officers can still be perpetrators of the inbred institutionalized American racism
It looks like a rectum
Rectum
Rectum
Rectum
Are you laughing at yourself like I am lol
Take a video on slo mo of you blowing a raspberry!!!
Lol screw you
One eyed one eared flying purple people eater
Thank god you don't have termites in your ass anymore though
This is too much for me
I'm going to send these when you least expect them
They're the best form of blackmail
K boo boo
Where do you save them :O
  
That's my new alarm
you have the 57 year old truck driver chain smoker pervert to perfection
Omg at least you're not Liz
With the scorpion haha
Be lucky with termites in your ear
  
🌚
Ok but REAAAALLY though
Keagan just used "lawlz"...
......
…...........
Why
In what context
To a funny video I sent
"Lawlz I just watched this and it's perf"
Send vid
It's really stupid like idk why he found it so funny
Exactly, especially when it's not worthy of such a response 
Beyoncé breathes and bitches start jerking their boyfriends off
Ok goodnight be
Ur beautiful
Ummmm????????
Did she answer
What the fuck Aimee
No not you
I just woke up like 5 seconds ago and I was about to text you
Oh nvm
Whoa
I'm magic
Like I open your texts seconds ago
The moment you sent it
What's your plan today
She wanted to know if we still want to run Global this year
I was up until 1:30 playing games on andkon arcade, like penny's diner or those strategy global domination games
I was gonna get breakfast with sienna not sure if still on. And then leave for camp around 3
I miss those games
I feel like I lost my guilty hobbies
Besides reddit, which isn't even a hobby, I just do respectable things
Sup
Hahahahah
I think I'm going to go out for breakfast too but I haven't picked a place yet
My plans were deferred
You masturbate and party? Lol
You played that skater game until you deleted
If you had a dog while growing up I think you would have liked it. Once you get to a certain age then it's kinda annoying because we get busy with lots of things, but in your childhood the dog is such a big part of your life!!!
When I was in 4th I got a puppy Rottweiler and he died like 2 weeks after he was born. I had to make a grave for him and on my tear-a-day table calendar I wrote "WORST DAY EVER IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
It was MLK day
I was also very jealous of Richie growing up because he was small enough to ride the dogs
My first kiss was MLK day
Lol that such a funny reason
Yeah but those aren't really hobbies. There's no progress. At least you can beat a game
You used to be an avid film watcher
No see
Lol MLK day is a big day for children and they don't even realize it
That too it's respectable 
Until later
I still watch TV but it's house of cards. I watch a movie that's won an Oscar
That's true. Also, you discuss them and analyze them and try to make real world connections. the average person would exit the theater and ask where to eat.
It's not like I don't have hobbies that aren't respectable
The only thing I can think of really is video games
Or like making friendship bracelets
What really is a hobby that isn't respectable?
Collecting action figures. Trading cards.
Why does respectable mean giving up our childhood vices?
Maybe we can go shopping
Well
I would say respectable hobbies are either
Idk... Going to the mall was a childhood thing
1. Social in person-- like cards
It's not respectable to own things from there anymore
2. Relevant to the greater world-- house of cards
3. Create something tangible-- a   pretty card table 
K b
Yes, however it is very unlikely that the average card player will further their hobby to pursue competitions or create formations
Where did you want to shop?
I have to go to work at 2pm
Park place?
We could go like very soon? 
So that doesn't matter?
Well I'm still going out to breakfast at Denny's but I can ask to be dropped off after that
Oh ok
Let me know when you get to Denny's, I'll start getting ready then
Alright :)
Mom: "let me tell you something. that was very rude of you the way you asked me to go with your friend when you knew we had plans after breakfast (to buy Zayna a birthday present????!!!)"
reasons why I never want children and want to get on with my own life
Will you be free tomorrow too? 
Tomorrow night I will be free
Ugh and I look so good right now
Among other reasons to want to go
Ok I'll leave u alone now and let u contemplate life alone
Ok :(
😘😘😘
Stay sexy babe
Text me before you leave though
I
K
???
Okay?
Ya sorry no implications there
I'm just working
Soul train is the best thing ever
It's a show where they brought on all the best like funk/soul/r&b/black pop singers in the 70's and they play and dance and everyone in the audience dances too
And they all dress cool with platform shoes and afros
And disco of course
It's like a show of triumph and liberation
And hope
Bitch
Ass bitch
:(
Hey yo
What work were you doing?
Finalizing class application but I finished that long ago
That sounds awesome! Can you send some links?
Is it only music or are there sketches too?
I still have 2 assignments due in a week but I'll do that later
Live Music + dance lines 
Back in the 70s it was ok for white people to have Afros smh what a shame this world we've come to
Samer needs to straighten
He is appropriating
Clowns need to get the fuck out
#StopClownAppropriation
Please send links though
Appropriating gay culture too.. The LGBT and POC culture is NOT a joke
Ok soon
Omg travolta Saturday night fever mmmmm
Clowns participate in whiteface
Fuck... I didn't even realize they were making fun of albinos
Literally Reagan
That's how evil that is
"LGBT culture"
Ohhhjj drag!!!!
I'm dumb lol
How evil is it on a scale from ladybugs to Reagan
We could find pictures of people/occupations on the Internet and call out what they're appropriating
No the rainbow
Ok!
I think most men don't realize they are appropriating gay culture all the time--- the village people!
Oh fuck Aimee I'm sorry I have to go to work now
n are so ignorant
Ok bye
Lol no
Or when men think it's ok to listen to Britney or Madonna or Gaga
Even Katy Perry
Ok are you leaving soon too?
Omfg I wanna kill those Katy perry cishits
Cishet---> cishit
~~
I found out what that means like last week lol
I thought it was ciSHet
And it was like cis shit
Not cis het
Ok anyway I'll see you later I'm actually gonna go to work now 💖🌺🙏🏿
pray to black angels for security
We can do our appropriation activity later hahahah
Hi
I'm back
When black people in suits think they can appropriate 
Sorry that was an accident
What
Duo
Sup
Hi. This is from your email.
I'm going to work soon
When do you finish
7pm
Shit
?
I mean that's late so
It's not realistic to go shopping then
Ok well
It's not late for me and I'll have the car but whatever
But the mall will be closed
We can still hang out though
It closes early on Sunday
Should I pick you up when I get off my shift?
Yeah I know
You're forgetting the mall was my life in 8th :P
I'll meet you. Where?
Why???
Ugh
Because I will likely be out with my car
Where are you going today
Shopping
I could just pick you up at your house at 7:15
Is that ok with you
Or if you don't want to go out then we can another day
Bc I'm gonna be going in very soon soo 
I only get one 15 minute break
Yeah that's good
7:15
Mm ok
? 
Idk
How was camping?
Did you smoke
I did not smoke!
And it was fantastic 
 
I'm done!!!
Let's hang out babe
I fucking hate the Dillard's parking area
 too
2 min
R u sleep or r u dancer
You NEED to watch this
LOL
"Your dick is so nice and thick. I'm glad I picked you." Lol
I thought it was funny
Did you forget how to text
What's up right now
I died 
I was facetiming my mom
With the tort
I hope I make enough $$$ by the time I go to college to clean out my closet and restock with sexy styles
Wow
"I'm not close to my parents"
That's a very sweet and rich thing to do
Hi
Sorry I spaced
But I am going to sleep :(
I suck
Ah okay
I'm watching a movie called Comet and there's a girl in the beginning who looks exactly like Bella Ruhl
Anyway
The character is super annoying though and intrudes in other convos
❤️
Ya I know 
The movie makes no sense it's like mr nobody but colorful and in our times
Ok anyway
That's a plus
Ya
Whenever I say it's pretty people get upset with me
I agree
It's pretty
It's nature
All natural
It's not in an area that is killing people
Destruction is beautiful
Fires happen in nature
People can be evacuated but not animals or plans :/ that's the only sad part
God save the plants
It's good for the plants and animals in the long run
Keeps the ecosystem happy
:)
Survival of the fittest, right?
This movie is super pretentious
The characters are describing what it means to use the adjective beautiful
Ugh
The description included the words "cells" and "molecules"
It's easy to define
Tortoise = beautiful
That's it
Everything else gets a different adjective
Nothing is worthy of beauty but too typist
#+}#+*|
*tortoise
🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢
🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
😴😴😴😴😴
That emoji fucks me up
The cool one. It's very sarcastic.
Something else fucks this guy up
🆗🆒
Is he begging to get fucked up or is he stating the facts
The world will never know
🆗🆒 = 😒
Jachnun
A Saturday morning meal from Yemeni Jews
It rox
That and sabich
Holy fuck sabich
It's like a slow cooked puff pasty but thick and glorious 
And savory
Sabich looks so good. I think I'll make a sandwich for myself for lunch this week.
Well
It involves all kinds of very specific preparation
It's the kind of thing people spend a lifetime perfecting
But yeah give it a shot
I've been looking for middle eastern food to cook for the basis global advertising campaign
Yas
Sabich was the best meal of my life
The guy only makes sabich and you can only have it one way 
I was gonna ask if it's the NYC equivalent to pizza but I thought that would be offensive
In a hole in the wall in central Tel Aviv
No it's not THAT popular and there aren't many variations on it
Like if it's a common street food item
The ingredients are consistent. It is common though.
Usually made in like shacks yeah
But not available at like the beach or the middle of nowhere or the grocery store freezer aisle
But yes good comparison, I would say yes
Then there's this thing called a Crembo 
Best dessert
Like the Israeli Oreo but way better
Light and flavored marshmallow-y stuff on top of a soft and semi sweet cookie all coated in chocolate
Ugh the food there is just so good
The only food I can talk about from my travels is the perigee
Pierogi 
Which is depressing as fuck
Hahahah
:(
Maybe you will get some cool D.C southern food
Also my mom isn't connected to her culture in a deep way like your parents (grew up in Israel, migrated here)
I wouldn't even say it's her culture
My knowledge of Latino food is maybe two soups and the names of different dishes I have never tried
In the same way that I consider American culture to be my culture
:(
Latin
Well ok but
I think crembo would be like those marshmallow puff things we ate that one time from bashas. Not Oreos lol
You have experienced a lot of ethnic food here
Way more than most
It is like that but if those were 100x better
Who hasn't tried an enchilada 
Mallomars try to be Crembo but don't come close. The Crembo is less thick, less marshmallow-y, more milky
No but like
Ethiopian
diterranean 
Thai
Indian
Greek
I'm getting Mina's for lunch tomorrow damn it you made me hungry
That's fair but it's not the same as experiencing it from the country itself, you know? (You should know!!!)
Well
The frozen pierogis are nothing compared to fresh ones in Indiana oh my godddddd
I mean when I went to Italy I liked their pizza and bread and cheese but it wasn't earth shattering 
I remember everything
It really depends on the country and how popular their food is here
:O
I can't even imagine how pierogis could be particularly appealing
Ok yeah but I mean trying something new somewhere else is special
I will probably remember my first street food meal when I go to NYC
Oh we had them at the polish restaurant!!!
I had an obsession for months after that and I made my mom search the frozen aisles for them but none compared
Lol street food is actually not that prevalent in NYC
And most of it is not at all exciting
Except in the hipster neighborhoods
But then it's hipster food
I'm going to look up food places in DC right now. It's weird that I'm leaving in like a week and a half.
It's just really expensive
Ya!
"Sophisticated Cajun-Creole cuisine"
With kale
Yeah so I'm hitting the G Street food plaza right across from the White House it looks awesome
Ya!
I keep imagining a lumberjack voice when you send that
🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚 b sorry I am sleepy but I enjoyed the good talk a lot
And I am hungry
And jealous 
Or like the schnitzel voice
They look Dutch
Red hair in pig tails
yaaaAAaahh
jaaAAaah
Ok yeah goodnight sorry for keeping you up
S'ok
🌚🌺🐸🙏🏾
🆒🐢
I'm beyond pissed off
I was gonna get a phone case this week but anyway I figured it wasn't that important because I have been dropping phones for years with no issue
And of course
I catastrophically cracked my phone 
It's barely even useable. And some color is distorted. Fuck my lyfeeeeee
There goes $109
Fuck!!!!!!!!
I was gonna order you one too and you could've been covered, like, yesterday
Can you take a picture and show me on your old phone?
That's so humiliating oh my god I'm sorry
What are your parents going to do
Also how was your day?
Ho
I'm sorry :( I couldn't listen to the audio messages earlier but I know you can get through everything
Is it this Tuesday?
That's great though that your phone is fixed and all. Jennifer spilled water all over her Mac this morning... It's in a bag of rice.
It is this coming Tuesday, not tomorrow.
:((((
Fuck Apple
I looked into my dorm more today
What makes his expectations so high for the paper?
Apparently it is literally the most coveted freshman dorm
I know right?
Even with distance factored in?
It was renovated like last year
Walk in closets
The other freshman door is only slightly closer
And brown is pretty small anyway
And it is next to the pool and rec center
The rooms have sinks which is apparently a big plus
Here's some photos
Oh and Doug is in my hall fuck
Is it only makes?
Males
Coed
Well I heard it used to be single sex floors
And I don't believe it is now though I am not sure
That's so awesome. That would be my dream dorm. Wake up for a morning swim or workout whenever I'm stressed
That's disconcerting for me and for you too I assume..
How progressive
Why is that disconcerting
Wait what is disconcerting
Doug
Oh
Yeah guess so but its like 200 people
So I'm not too worried
Is that your common room?
There is one per floor
Love the cubical furniture 
It's one of the lounges
Two per floor
Those photos are of Andrews and the two adjacent halls
How was your day
Did you listen to the new this American life
Actually, there's only one photo I like (dorm room interior with furniture. Also aren't you worried about using the restroom with everyone around? "Why don't you ever use the urinal"
That's a thing guys notice
No see the bathrooms are single 
I think
They were everywhere else I went
I'm pretty pretty sure
Like the bathroom are separate rooms
My day was okay. Kittredge announced that he's moving at the end of the month and our replacement CC is Winkelman... I've also decided I'm going to ask Rosinbum and Swindle for my letters.
Drama is in the process of finalizing our season. It's probably gonna be Harvey, Suddenly Last Summer, and Much Ado About Nothing. We are now officially the BASIS Blackbox Bandits, although I preferred Blackbox Bitches
I hung out with people today after school, mainly Reyna and Diviya and Nate.
We started a college collaboration group chat to discuss common app stuff
I am finishing up the first AL podcast right now (6 minutes left) and I'll probably watch a movie after that
Kittredge today to Claire asking why he's leaving: not to belittle you since you're still a kid and you can't possibly understand why I would leave, but when an adult is offered a position of leadership and it impacts their career they take it
Damn so I was right. 
?
About him moving
Also wink is good though 
How do you feel about him leaving
I'm upset. I expressed my concerns to him: Kittredge is more experienced, he taught us more recently, he is more aware of the BASIS culture. Wink is going to shadow in our classes.
Anyway
You're absolutely right
You wish you had billings?
Kitt told me he held a screening process and that Wink had the best writing, but yes, I want her over him.
  
All the food is covered for me...
Omg that rocks
I wish I could see the cc selection process it sounds interesting
You HAVE to do shawarma
"if you want breakfast ordered in or if the cafeteria breakfast is okay"
I'm staying in Maryland at night and we are taking some vehicle to DC
 too. Kitt said that Wink beat out all the applicants outside and inside of school.
Anyway I feel like I'm bothering you or something or you had a bad day and need some alone time, so I'll watch my movie I guess
I have your 2nd present if that makes things better :)
I hope you're feeling okay and I'm sorry your day was so shitty. It absolutely sucks that you are stressed out but I know that you'll power through it.
Here's a little nostalgic vine: 
(no matter who was at the door for parties)
No no sorry
I was just getting settled sorry!
Omg Veris
Who pays for this trip
Damn wink
Damn
Do you know how many applicants or any other details?
They just tested his own writing?
❤️❤️❤️
What did you think about this American life
I have no idea who is paying. I'm gonna send back an email and ask if there's a general budget
Bc salmon looks good af lol
Some kosher meals are like $25
Nope. There was an interview too, of course. I wondered what the process consisted of though.
Oh ok I just wasn't sure and I didn't want to annoy you
I thought you weren't replying because you were tired of mof 
*pf me
Dis rican Lyfe was super depressing, although I was glad to hear the final report that integration was successful and the parent's concerns over violence and decreased scores didn't manifest, which made me so so so so happy
How is the second part any different?
 
I look bad but very happy. I was inspired by your poetry genius and sweatpants so I wore the same, except I got A LOT (and I mean A LOT) of dick stares and people even called it out. Nina, Reyna, Bella, Zayna, Jennifer, Madeleine, and Martha told me they could see my dick.
But that I looked hot regardless.
When I listened to the audio messages and I heard you talk about your day I wanted to cry. I felt so terrible for you, Aimee.
Alrighty well Aimee
No Sergio omg
Sorry I was jerking off this whole time
?? I'm going to sleep
Oh
Ok let me reply first :(
I thought you were already asleep so lol
I am not tired of you!!
Ever
The second part is about a success story
You fucking tease you send a text about your dick with a pic attached with only torso
Listen to Hotline Bling by Drake. It's his new single, although it gets repetitive so listen to 3 minutes
I know haha everyone else got to see it today but you
I almost cried all day because of the phone I was sooooo pissed. That so nice of you
Then I almost threw it on purpose out of anger
Aight
I've almost done that too.
When my iPad cracked I just wanted to burn it I was so pissed
It was disgraceful to have it in my presence 
Listen to "High By the Beach" too. 
I'm only asking for 6 minutes of your time lol
I felt the same way
Ok ok
Ok actually need to come clean
Half the time I was jerking
Other half there was an askreddit thread for people with HIV to tell their stories and it was engrossing
One guy helped an injured guy out of his car after an accident, ripping shit apart, and the victim bled on him a bit, and the guy was cut from ripping the metal. Bam
Another guy was part of a very large STD study in 1979 before the epidemic and they had kept his blood and tested it-- a huge boon for the knowledge of the origins of HIV in the U.S. He and others requested not to know their status cos there was nothing that could be done, but finally asked for it in 1991. Another didn't know and infected his partner and his partner died 
A couple were college girls who were raped
And a guy who was drugged and raped in a bar
Ok I'm sorry sorry ugh I meant to go to sleep at 11 but I lost track of time and now I'm so upset with myself
I'll read in the morning I promise
Sorry!
🌚
🌚🍑🙏🏾💜🌺💕🐸
^they look bad together but whatever
"When the moon comes out I dream of an ass and pray to it and love it and fuck it and love it some more until I make froggish mating calls"
Way to incorporate the rectum!!!!
Would you mind sending the link for the HIV stories? That sounded crazy as fuck
I felt awful reading the first one about the guy who contracted it accidentally 
I'm applying for an Amherst fly in and I put my race on the app. Should my essay focus on being gay?
No
Can you come on Tuesday? 
I'll send the link
You should focus on your turn around
For a diversity fly in?
Yeah I can!
What's the prompt
"We ... give special importance to the inclusion of talented persons from groups that have experience prejudice and disadvantage ... because the best and the brightest people are found in many new places, not few; because our classrooms and residence halls are places of dialogue, not monologue; because teaching and learning at their best are conversations with persons other than ourselves about ideas other than our own."
Tells us how your own experiences and background will allow you to contribute to these discussions
Ok gay is still not good
But neither is my suggestion
The turn around and seeing Both sides of ignorance and education 
Ugh
Maybe slip gay in
Plus what you said
I've experienced homophobic mom and supportive mom
Lower class and middle class
Ignorance and intelligence
Atheism and deep religious understanding
You could talk about dichotomies
Can you think of one more person or two for Tuesday?
Yeah I'll ask Reyna and Madeleine today for you
Thank you bae 💖
Thanks b
Soap 
Hahah what
Did you ask them
Reyna says yes and Madeleine is considering with the time
Thx beebz
How was your day
I cleaned my room and later I will work on my Jim Crow essay
Slow day. 
Well I also organized my clothes, like what I would and wouldn't wear
Removed all the shit that was too small or old or in bad taste
Hey! I finished u-pick but we got caught in the storm and I just left 
Joseph is going to volunteer with us next week I think hahah
My day was awesome. The drama teacher said she loves how I stand up for what I think and that I would be a good stage manager, so that's what I'm doing for the after school drama club
Also Rosinbum melted my heart today when I asked for a letter
He said of course and that I'm disdainful in such a respectful way and he appreciates it. I'm intelligent, he loves having me in class, I'm critical, I'm funny.
I wanted to cry and I was so in love
That's productive!!! Each step to organization is necessary. I'm glad! 
How are you feeling?
Also Madeleine will text you with questions I couldn't answer hahah
Too small or too old or in bad taste can always be donated to me.... Lol
Right now is probably the biggest storm we have had all summer 
Omg stage management is sooo stressful
Too small would totally not fit but I will show you if you want
XXS and XS
I am feeling great but I was tired all day
Sounds like you had a great day
Disdainful? What
That's not a positive
No he said it was the wrong word. He meant critical or skeptical of facts I'm faced with and that I prefer to question and investigate on my own.
I know :( she said I would be the stage manager and I wanted to be like, "haha shouldn't it be a gay of the other gender?" but I would probably get in trouble 
I'm going to be in four productions this year. One of which is a musical.
Great, I would love to see the clothes. 
I feel ya boy. I wasn't tired today but that was definitely me yesterday.
Wait Aimee are you completely certain that you can't find the brown sock you borrowed anywhere
So what's up
Let's meet soon? I'll bring the water bottle and the clothes
They are in two trader joes bags
Are you gonna audition for the lead
You might like some of the clothes in the "not my style" category
Floral ones
Though I kept the purple flower shirt and the best
Vest
On the fence about the red floral
Not the rose one, the rose is too small
Well the sock is important to me... It was a Christmas present from Jennifer and that was the only fun pair of socks I've ever owned
Did you go storm chasing? How did it go?
I'm going to audition for the lead for every play
Oh a fun sock?
What pattern?
Sorry didn't mean to be so inconsiderate 
And the picnic bitch when
Well we more or less missed it but we went up to the rillito and it had some ponds
I'll look, I'm sorry. If I don't find it I'll get you some other pair though I know it won't be the same so I'll look hard
I mean it doesn't look like the nicest sock but I loved it a lot hahah. I don't mean to place such a burden on you but I would deeply appreciate it if you looked.
Picnic bitch
You haven't told me a day that works for you
Sorry I haven't been replying
I don't really have a good reason
Im just writing emails and researching colleges
I'm so tired though
Soooooooooooo
I feel like a huge asshole
I kept saying I would but ya
Sorry I fell asleep
Ok
How is today
Sunday works for me
I meant how is your day going
I was relaxing reading the NYT and then I get an urgent email asking for what I had thought was my weeks work, needed ASAP. Fuck. 
Hey
I'm at an evaluation for my wisdom teeth. Also I have to work from 6 to close..
What ended up happening with the email?
Today was great. Kittredge helped me with my essay and he was more and more surprised as he kept inquiring about my experiences. He loved my initial approach but was thrilled with the final topic: the fanatic church and it's indoctrination methods on me, and my transition to becoming a critical thinker
This whole thing has consumed me it's all I think about it's insane
If you plan dates with me or tell me when you're available I can plan my work schedule around that
I make my new schedule every weekend 
How are you feeling?
How did the evaluation go? 
I am working on it now. Half way done or so
Send me the draft?
I am available like all the time except when you are at school so just let me know when you know
When does he get back in town?
Monday but I need it sent to him tonight
Well it said ASAP but I took the liberty of making that mean tonight. 
Remember when fun. was a thing lol
I have to get the top two out first.. :/ I meet with the surgeon in October 
Did you get yours out?
Of course! I used yours as inspiration a lot last night
Get it done 😊
I don't think I have any 
Lol yes I hated them
Well I'm working on it, I have all day, but by now I am scraping the bottom of the barrel
I feel bad that we haven't been talking much
When will we see each other
AIDS flyer dispensation on Saturday 
You don't have any???
Well when are you working this week?
I am literally free all the time but Saturday, though I will probably be free some of Saturday so that might work
I feel the same way
Yeah I don't think I have any. Not sure, I didn't count, but my dentist I think said that once or something
How was your day
I am sad that you are working when I am not working though I understand
Obama wrote a short NYT editorial in favor of voting rights
The article which took me like 3 sessions to read is 29 pages long
Practically a dissertation about the history of voting rights and some profiles 
Sergio omg
There was this guy Kevin who was the height of androgyny and I thought was like a model a couple years back at SOS, he was a musician not an actor. Now he is on Nicole's snap story, I think they are together? Or a GBF? unknown. Shocking 
I really miss you
I want to meet up soon, I have so many things to tell you, nothing in specific but just like life, and to laugh, and listen to cool music..:
Legally blonde
It's a sad day when you watch legally blonde alone and can't share the jokes with a friend
Cos the boy is at work
Hi!!! 💖💖💖
I'm missing you so much too I just got off
I'm working Friday and Saturday 5pm-close
We can hang out on Saturday all morning
We can't though cos I'm busy
Thursday and Sunday
Work
Thursday and Sunday you're busy?
Okay well I hope you are free Saturday morning so we can do the AIDS thing and maybe get breakfast
Also I have gifts
"a short NYT editorial" lol
I'm free after school tomorrow
Models attain the skinny model look through cocaine/meth so it wouldn't surprise me if Nicole knows him
Ok I'm joking
No I'm free those two day
Days
I am not free Saturday morning
Ohhh I see. Your snapchats explain why you miss me.
How was your day?
Believe what you want lol
No actually I got an email back from Dr. doctor and he seemed happy so I was happy but you were at work so I wasn't happy 
Cos I couldn't share 
You can always send things and I'll read them later! I love hearing about your day so much. Like I always try to ask you questions and stuff and I want to hear.
I see you watched legally blonde :(
Yes I finished it and it rocked
When I read that I got sad because I miss watching movies with you and laughing and stuff
Elle really resonates with me
And welcome to me was added to Netflix
That's great though! The ASAP and sardonic tone didn't sound promising
What sardonic tone
My day was awesome. I made friends at work and we laughed over Justin Bieber's butt.
I found a cool SAT vocab app but I guess it's too late for us
I befriended a gay xican who is majoring in journalism
How is his butt
Ew
He was showing me his tattoos and stuff.
He turned 18 recently
His butt is on Instagram lol
Why does Elle resonate with you?
You after getting into all 13 (14 bc NAU accepted you without an application): "What? Like it's hard?"
WELCOME TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHHAAH
Neutering dogs on live television
That scene was disturbingly funny. I found that funny but I think I'm fucked up so
It's not too late for me!!! What's the app?
Oh god I want to lie in your bed and watch a movie with you so badly
I think it's called SAT vocab, you have to buy more lessons sadly 
I thought it was so funny
Are you going to bed soon 😔 you're texting like bedtime
I don't think I'm texting like bed time but sadly yes
I've done all the flash cards if we are thinking of the same app
Can I pick you up tomorrow
Yeah there's a specific bedtime texting method lol
It's not a flash card app
Trust me on this
Of course :)
I might take the car to school tomorrow though..,
Elle resonates with me because people don't expect shit from her and she gets motivated by that
It depends on what my mom says in the morning.
Ok I can figure it out
Just don't plan an after school anything 
I forgot that characteristic... Maybe I haven't seen the movie in a while? The entire time I feel like she doesn't have an intellectual broadening or expansion though. Like yes, she solves the mystery but it's nothing to expect sgain, you know?
Okay bb 
You got my time slot
She graduates top and studies like a mofo
But U.S.
U.S.
Ya*
Gr8
Oh I forgot about that foo
Too
Idk if I should watch a movie or work on my Amherst and middle bury essays
Or sleep lol
🌚💩🇮🇱👬🍆🌺🍵🎅🏿🐢
Don't sleep yet!!!!
I need advice for an executive decision
Mm watch a  movie
Unless Amherst is due this week
Middlebury due 14th I haven't started yet
Amherst due 17th
In that case watch two movies cos you need to stress less
Mmmmmmmm

Yea idk
Fuck the institution
Love ya anyway

Breakfast
U boob
SERGIO OMFG
I gained like half an inch to an inch
So I'll probably keep growing
And be like 5'8" or 9"
This Asian important guy named his daughter rissa lol
Stereotypes
Hello
Hey I just got home
I got my first paycheck and your final gift
I look like a duck, lol
How was your day?!!!
When do you start working?
Also I fucking hate improv
I suck so bad
It was uneventful, I went in for a 3 minute meeting
Literally went all the way there for 3 minutes 
What did you suck at
I went to the doctor and got three shots
What is that breakfast. It looks like something sweet or savory, but I can't tell which 
Lol it is baked apple
With like honey and oats
Also that's great!!!! I told Nate and Joseph when I got the "I grew" news and they were like "ummmm..."
They thought I was talking about your sensitive area
Hahahahahahahah
I'm going to work at 5 :/
How did you respond to their assumption
Well I said no lol because I really don't understand how that could have been misinterpreted 
Also it's evidence for this theory I discussed with Nate and Joseph and jay that humans are inherently sexual
And Nate said I just want to sleep with him lol
Lol
Yeah really that's pretty unambiguous 
Though I think people assume everything you say could be sexual
That's sooo stupid. A three minute meeting. What a dick
I sucked at coming up with a persona to take on
Well 5 is approaching
So if I don't reply don't let that stop you
 Alright, enjoy your work
I will be crying alon
Alone 
I'm sorry, my love
Send fun things 
Ummmm OKAYAYYAYYYY
I am so bored sorry
Without reddit and you 
And I'm bored of house of cards
And I don't have the will to watch a full movie
I just had a customer go like, "my name's pronounced Kah-Tahn. Spelled Cotton."
So I'm reading 1491
Lol
What race
And I checked out the CUTEST black lesbian couple ever.
They had a little baby and they had a pride flag on their credit card
Was either one and to
Andro
Cotton is a white man lol and he was looking for "authentic" coach and fossil bags
Lol
Well there was a more masculine black lady with a buzzed Afro
Why no recdit?
reddit
Reddit is stupid
And I want to be over it
I guess I have work to do but I don't want to do it right now
I read all those things I wanted to read last night though
And I made the PowerPoint
So it's not like I did no work
I'm missing the clapping emoji? I was gonna send it about your new discovery buttttttt
Lol yeah I'm exhausted right now
Lol
I'm on my 15 minute break but I just want to leave
Maybe you need an under the counter bj ;);)
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Found it
Is it frowned upon if I bring you a surprise? (Not bj)
All of my emojis are Latino
Oh yeah Alex Poelstra and isamuu came in and I checked them out
whoa
How was that
I was like "hello Alex, are you ready?" And he said "my body is ready" right in front of my manager
Maybe they are just tan bitch don't be racist 
Hahaha it's a very fast paced environment everyone would notice
Did manager say shit
No but I tried to keep it professional. We talked about school starting and Sarah Lawrence
Isamuu has a terrible bowl cut
Nothing new there
My mom texted me and asked where the laptop is (I hid it) and I haven't replied
It's on and I don't want her reading my essays...
Lol
Is it a shared laptop
The thing is that my family buys other laptops but some idiots break them after a week....
Mine is the only one in good condition
So yes, now it is
You know, I got $90 for 11 hours of work
Is that good or bad
Or it was like 10.4 hours or something actually
How does that even happen
I get 8.75/hour
Seems no taxes were taken out
Nope! And guess who's getting a new fleshlight wit da moneyz dooeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait for real
My brother does stupid sex video chats and the computer gets a virus, idk
You could get some clay and mold it around your dick
Lol jk. He drops it and shit
And then fire it
And fill it with silicone
And then your dick will live on forever
No. I was actually planning on taking you out for dinner
How would I pee ;(
How would I jerk off
Maybe your brother is high all the time :O
How would I feel anything
Oh
Awww
The mold
Wowwwww Sergio
Yes
Wtf
Picnic Sunday we need to plan still
I could penetrate myself with my own mold
Ideally, on the mountain so we can eat and then kiss and then hike
Ow
Ok I need to talk to them about my schedule bc it's all sorts of fucked up
They have me down for Sunday, Monday (I have scouts???), Friday (5pm-2am?!!!!?!!! That's the most concerning. Idk who the fuck thought that was ideal), and Saturday
I literally gave them my availability
But yes, I hope it works out
That is so sad
Literally it's right when I am free that you work
I mean week days yeah but
I mean I guess mornings
No but they're great about accommodating to my needs
I basically work whenever I want
Don't worry 💖
I'll see you later, break's over.
Enjoy your book bae
Bye bae
Oh my god
I just fucking got out
Fucking customers suck!
:(
Ok then
Hi
Sorry I was sleeping
What happened
Your shifts seem so long
I know but I was just sad you didn't text me at all
it's all on messenger from last night 
I had terrible dreams
I cheated on you twice and I was late to work by over an hour
:(
I feel so alone lately
Well like not really alone, because I go to school and see all of my friends and stuff, but I mean in terms of you
What a bitch, why didn't you tell her to go
What was she like? Old?
I'm not going to church today
I'm going somewhere to work
She was kinda ghetto and Latina. She wanted to sign up for a savers club card (another 5 minutes) and her daughter was like, "do you speak any languages other than English mom?" And her mom said French and the girl was like "no you don't???"
Then the mom said, "girl I know errythang"
She was maybe 32 at the oldest
We can't be too rude I guess? I was the only one in the store being nice to her
She kept asking me for my opinion on the clothes and she was like, "is this the biz/business or no? Ugh but it's forever 21. So cute!"
One time she was like "thank god we got the fashion police up in dis bitch"
The girls and I play word association games, so like one of us will say LOL or OMG or something and we'll come up with words
Then this happened:
Mine are always the best. Here's mine from the OMG round:
-Obstetricians may gag 
-Organic minus GMOs
-Oatmeal's messy guaranteed
-Oxford millionaire gentlemen
-Oscar movie guilt
Ok well ur just dead so I'll talk to you later then :/
Sorry I'm with family friend I don't want to be rude
Ok
I might be back before you go to work
We could chill
Yeah ok
Hi
That's actually pretty interesting, too bad he's a butt head
He's been really nice to me this year
What's up
I just got home
I've been arguing with Martha about what adulthood means
We have this college group chat and we're trying to help Martha come up with a common app prompt
Lol
What does she say it means
We're not mature emotionally or legally
And I'm saying that emotionally comes from different experiences and that some people can experience it before the legal age
She disagrees
She is also privileged
It makes sense
Ok the last part is a joke
Anyway
I definitely think she isn't very adult
What have you done today
Is your family at church
Are you not at church
I finished my Amherst essay and fly-in application. I was at the library all morning. I'm going back soon.
No church for me
Should I send it to you?
When I showed it to Kittredge and I told him you helped edit it he was like
"Yeah, I'm not gonna read those"
He told me it was beautiful
Which library?
Lol that's flattering. Also congrats! It's great to be done
With this step
:))
Yeah I know man
I'm starting my Amherst supplements this week 
Don't "man" me
Sorry
Why Amherst for you
Wait so what is your plan this afternoon
Why aren't you answering me :(
I want to see you Sergio
I'm working from 5pm-sometime. I'll probably be out earlier because my manager, Marco, said im doing projects today
How was picacho peak
I got lost there once
And until 5 you are working?
I'm making a quesadilla right now lol
Alone?
My mom's asleep and Alex is on the laptop
Oh
Alex can use a laptop?
She said I can go to they raft though
The library
I was gonna go there after eating
No, he can't!!! It's frustrating 
Oh is that how he breaks it
So like what does he even do
Picacho peak was awesome, we went to the ostrich farm
And there were all kinds of cool animals
Loved it
How did you get lost??
He hits the trackpad and keyboard
What do you think of library?
Are you against it
Oh I didn't realize I could come? I tried to ask and you didn't answer 
That sounds great, which library
The one on Wilmot
Yeah ok
Ok lemme know when you're close and leaving and stuff
I'll leave in like 10
Coming
 2
R u here
I'm next to ur car
No weigh
When you are done, could you send me the essay Zayna thought was mine, the UChicago?
 
 
If you finish early you should come downtown
With us
:)
Hey 
That's so fucked up ughhh
What
That you guys are going downtown
Who's going
Reyna Nate Diviya
:(
Ughhhhhh
Maybe we can meet up after
Like how late would you be willing to stay out?
Pretty late
Ok good
This'll work out then
We can finish our intimate moment up tonight hahah
You have no idea how depressing it was to have to leave you
I missed you the moment I drove away. I was so happy today, Aimee.
Could we have a sleepover at your place?
My mom said she wants me to come home after work before going out
I was so happy too
Maybe. 
:)
<3 <3 <{
Kooky last heart
Hi
Hey how's it going
Great what's up with you
What're you guys doing
What am I missing
The store's closing now
We are on 4th it has been awesome
Besides missing you, of course lol
I'll tell you in person
I want to quit retail 
I'll also tell you in person
Why
Ok
What's the plan
So how feasible is a sleepover
I'm getting out before 10 so really soon
Going home and I should be there by 11
What's up
Ok I'm done!
Yes!!!!
I would love to
What time
10:30?
When r u guys leaving 
Can you tell me when you're going to black crown
Hello????
Hi sorry I was driving b
We are at black crown now
....
You were supposed to tell me
Ugh well then I'll leave now
Sup
LOL
Yes
I got home to literally do nothing. Some chores that took 10 minutes but I've been listening to rent and writing
That's too bad I'm taking Reyna home this is my first time using dictation so if it doesn't work I'm sorry
:(
Anyway have a good one
No no sorry I just got home
I am reading your article right now
Ok
I'm not working today
But the article took a while for me to read 
Anyway I just feel shitty and stuff so
I'm still reading it
Why do you fee shitty?
Idk
For one, my manager got upset with me for calling in.
Anyway I'm just really upset and blue right now
So I feel like you talking to me wouldn't be good
It's too complex for anyone to deal with by myself and I end up hurting people
Alright, well I hope you work through it and do something that makes you happy 
*with but myself
I don't think you ever hurt me but that's ok
No but I feel like I can't have emotions without you getting upset
I understand it's expression but
Well if you want to have this discussion
Yes exactly
Ok but how do you think it makes me feel too
I feel like a bad person
I feel bad for feeling anything and for the way I act
I feel like I should have just left work and gone straight home
I'm so upset
I fuck everything up
I think you should take a nap
This is just self-destructive
Your boss was inevitably going to be pissed
And if your job is going to upset you this much and put you in a bad mood, it would probably be best if you quit now rather than later in the week
Ok but a lot of it was also feeling uncomfortable with you two
It really doesn't matter anymore
Do you feel that you would have felt so strongly if you firstly didn't get upset from work, and secondly didn't retreat to the living room?
I don't think being upset from work was a major problem. The reason I blamed work was because I wasn't there initially and you two had already done your things and whatever while I was gone
So I felt like I was intruding on something already happening
There - downtown or whatever
I don't think that is fair to us.
I'm not denying you felt that way
But if you put yourself in my shoes 
When you hang out with them alone, and at school, I have to deal with that constantly 
Not that you resort to living rooms but you have been sad over it
The reason I left was to give you guys alone time or whatever
Right but that's a big difference. I was upset but I didn't act out and let it affect later interactions so negatively 
?????
What
We didn't need alone time at all. How did you come to that conclusion?
I felt excluded
What made you feel excluded? 
It seemed like you guys enjoyed your company a lot and when I came it didn't mean anything
It's no specific things but little actions to make up a whole. Like when you say I exclude you sometimes and I'm not.
It felt like you both were (you more than her)
While we did enjoy downtown, we wanted you to come and have fun with us entirely
And that's fair, but going to another room to make the situation worse just heightens the issue and makes the whole thing uncomfortable 
Sergio, I know I have said this before, but I feel that you have really not taken into consideration how your actions in themselves perpetuate your feelings of discomfort. You need to find a more constructive way to deal with such situations.
I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable, I understand and I am not disregarding that
Why do you assume I don't realize that? I just don't know what a constructive way to deal with that is yet.
Do you understand how upsetting it is when I encourage you to make an Instagram so we can all send links
Or I grab both of you by the head to tell you I love you both
You read the entirety of the Atlantic article?
And then you're all telling secrets and stories and talking about some dance on a YouTube video
What else am I going to do
Telling secrets?
Or whatever the fuck
What the fuck Sergio
What
That was inflammatory, and wholly a result of emotional interpretation and not a fair representation of the facts of the night at all
Okay well I'm sorry
I did not read the article in its entirety
There is a concept of cognitive behavior therapy, and Buddhist philosophy, stoicism, many philosophies, that our view of life is distorted by our mentality, and that we can recognize and correct for these distortions.
I'm usually very cynical
I don't trust a lot of people
And, in my opinion, that would be beneficial in the case of last night. We were not telling secrets. We were not acting unusually in watching music videos, something that is primarily your interest, not ours. And telling stories is no crime. You were upset from work and came in with poor attitude and didn't want to contribute; that does not mean we third wheeled you, that means you isolated yourself. When I ask you what is wrong and you don't answer and go be by yourself, that's not me isolating you. 
Oh my god but it's not even a matter of the activities we are doing. A lot of it is the way we act in the presence of other people, specifically Reyna.
The attention dynamic
Because you were withdrawn from the second you came into black crown
And I tried to draw you in
And you were being all grumpy
You know what. You're so right. I wasn't engaging in conversation at the couch or holding you guys or anything.
Or talking about my brother and BASIS or anything, basically
Just me
Super withdrawn
But you turn on a dime
One wrong move and you get all weird and then it's a snowball effect 
What do you want me to do about this
I want you to either externalize your feelings so we can remedy the situation in the moment before it becomes problematic
Or just let it go and continue trying to enjoy the company and bring yourself back to the center of the company. 
And honestly at this point I don't care that much
It frustrates me but it doesn't really matter 
The point is that I care about you 
And I want you to understand this issue so you can better yourself for future relationships
Though I feel
That this behavior is a manifestation of your insecurity with me
And that if you were in a relationship you felt more secure in that you wouldn't act like this given the same scenario
And so I hope you find that security that you seek
I guess something that fucked me over is how you said you loved me and liked me and whatever in 8th grade and then you said "oh jk" so fast
But I couldn't agree with you more
A situation like that would certainly lead to some insecurity issues with the same person in the future
Basically, I'm really sorry for the way things happened and I appreciate your help
You know the reason I initially was going to call in today was bc I thought picnic was today
But that's alright
That's what I thought the plan was too
Oh!
But you slept over so it complicated things
But if you want we could still picnic
Mm
Eh
Why
Uh
Ow
Uf
Ok
MmEhUhOw 😺
Pk*
😹
Ok lol sorry I was just being weird
😎
Well...
We can go eat somewhere and see a movie
🆒🆒🆒
🆗🆒❓
And exchange gifts there?
Or what
Fuck, my final gift won't be ready ready yet
We could see tangerine 
Yeah!
It's ok mine is long overdue for your put off birthday
Tangerine 7:30!
Hahahah I forgot about that
Regarding the insecurity from 8th grade though, while I very possibly would feel the same way, it's really too bad that you felt that overshadowing our time now
Ok 7:30
Food before?
Cheap food
 I understand that what we have now is stronger, but because you dismissed me for reasons (someone else provided more 'intellectual stimulation', etc.) and us initially doing things without commitment made me feel that at any time you could find someone better
Like there's always someone better and you were the type of person to get that
I mean I don't feel exactly like that now
It's a lot less intense of a feeling
It made me feel like I was in a competition with the rest of the world
And I guess now I kinda feel that way with people you admire
Which is unfortunate and I'm sorry
I know this is kinda silly but There's a memory of me sitting on my ex-grandfather's bed, in his guest room, and you and Sophia were texting me. There was some hashtag thing.and I felt really insulted and stupid. Like there are just things you don't forget, idk.
Of course, these thoughts don't affect the way I think of you directly. If there's any influence it's subtle and unintentional.
It's only a reflection
I care about you a lot and it's the last thing on my mind
Food before sounds nice
I've been wanting to try that Indian food truck but idk when they close
Is fuddrucker's cheap. I don't remember?
I was the type of person to get what? But yes, given the context I understand the initial desire for commitment with significantly greater clarity. Though it is very much too bad that continued to feel that way regarding people I admire. It's a bit suffocating for me, but I see the origin.
I remember when I let her use my phone and you got angry, and wanted to assure it was me you were talking to after that.
Lol no not really cheap
Indian food truck is good if it is open
Sonic, Taco Bell, La Salsa
The truck isn't doing dinner today :(
Too bad Chick-Fil-a closes Sunday. I understand it's a day of rest but I mean it's so exclusive 
Lol any other ideas?
Lol native grill and wings?
Beyond bread?
I was gonna suggest either that or baggins but I didn't think you were in a sandwich mood
Fresh sandwich
I am in a sandwich mood but
I don't think either place will work actually because baggins closes at 5, and beyond bread at 6
I mean we could hurry
What kind of businesses are we dealing with here god damn
I mean subway is 24/7 and I have a gift card
Lol I'll ok I'll pick you up
Ok I need to ask mom first
Let me know when you know
I'm just gonna hang out and drive around because there's a podcast I want to listen to and it's hard for me to listen to podcasts when I'm out of my car
She said okay
Ok 
Ok well I could be ready very soon. Should I give you time?
No
It'll take me 15 to 20 minutes to get there anyway
Hahaha okay then
Alright, let me know when you're leaving
Here
Ok 3 min?
R u ready
4 what
Sleep 😔
Goodnight!
Wow
When I saw that this morning I though it was a bruise
Like something out of he pathology books that you wanted me to see
Also my day went so much better than expected
He came in at noon so I got to finish up some stuff, and he was still happy at the pro/con list, and the additions I made this morning, so he didn't seem to consider what I had done for the remainder of the last week at all.
He said it was "brilliant A+ work" and that he had never considered many of the angles
So, I am wayyyyy less stressed
I also had a decompressing discussion with one of the office girls before he came in, she talked about how he stresses her out. Also, I realized I do my best work under intense pressure, which is unfortunate.
How was your day?
Probably less of an emotional roller coaster than mine
I tend to catastrophize.
Like if I fuck up one assignment I will fail the job and never succeed in life
To be fair that's how high school can be
Fail one test, and you have a C and can't get into the college you wanted
And then you can't have the life you wanted
And you get depressed
And kill yourself
Thanks Mr. Chambers
Though actually I am still a bit stressed because the other office lady said that she had emailed him that there was "zero tolerance" for issues and imperfections in the meeting tomorrow and I haven't even rehearsed my presentation
Hey
"Let me tell you all the things" -me
"Hey" - you
Jk I do that all the time
No sorry I'll reply, just on my way home
I'm going to DC the 23-26th
Iwhich makes me sad because I think you'll already be gone
Who are you taking tomorrow?
Could you take Madeleine?
I think I'll be here.
But we won't see "do I sound gay" when it comes out
Gonna leave on the 29th
I can take anyone, so yes
We can see it the day I get back the 
Right but the first night is with an anthropology professor q and a but that's ok
Also 
Did anyone ask if they would be allowed to leave school?
I know you said you weren't planning to go to school
And jay and Madeleine are 18
Lol he needed you to provide an element of empathy for the lower classes to his project. That's great though! 
I do my best work when it's something I really want to do. Last night I wrote this bomb ass Carleton essay and it was the best thing ever.
Like I have to share it with you
Eh, I've learned to love and manipulate my shortcomings to work in my favor.
A C doesn't mean much to me anymore. I know I'll do well because I want to.
Kittredge thinks I have a good chance at Macalester and Reed
Fuck.... That zero tolerances thing I rough. What's your presentation on? Who all are you giving it to?
My day was great. We did a speed dating thing in research and I'm working on developing my research project. It's going to be about the formation and struggle to maintain a Jewish identity on college campuses, especially with all of this extreme liberalism and political anger
I also switched out of capstone physics (THANK GOD!!!) into macrobio with all of my buddies (Joseph, Jen, Bella, Martha)
Joseph was an excellent addition to my lunch time. I really like him a lot.
Share!
Giving it to you guys about the pros and cons of stem&m lol
So everything I've already read
That sounds like an interesting project
No I added some interesting things
How/why did you switch out?
Btw I intentionally included double affirmatives. 
I switched out because physics is a bore and I don't want to read 90 pages of physics shit. I'd rather read about the animals.
Yes
Did you do that to mildly irritate me?
Sergio
Diviya is the only one that might need a ride
Check with her? I haven't heard from her.
I thought you said you did nothing in physics
No? I did it because everyone thinks I hate him.
Did it mildly irritate you
No no
The double affirmative 
Yes, I know
What
I don't dislike him
I am so confused
Oh you mean in the Joseph statement
I thought you meant in another text
Which one?
"So everything I've already read"
Oh no
Carleton?
All in good for
? Wat
I agree you have great odds to macalester and reed though I think you would better fit at macalester
Larissa's email to me today
*all I'm good for 
You know, that email makes her sound so professional and dignified
So does my writing lol
I sent it to y u
Please don't hit me
It deepens my understanding for how she managed to succeed so much, together with my experience with her at Amherst. We had like such a great time talking. I felt like I'd never met her before like that
It's not quantifiable but I disagree. I have never seen you write like she wrote in that email. Not that you can't, I just haven't seen it. 
Not that professionally 
When is this due
I would prefer to discuss in person
Not that there is a whole lot wrong with it at all
Also what's your plan for the week
I for one am free 
Due sept 3rd
I don't think it sounds professional. it's very casual. I feel like the average person discussing a common app would talk the same way.
Essay
My google drive is being dumb
Yes but it is long and it uses semicolons ugh
Could you check your email
It should have a request for access
I thought you said you read it already
And wanted to discuss in person
I did but
I went to open it on my computer
To read it more seriously
And it said I didn't have permission and even though the email was there it wasn't in my shared with me folder
And yes I made sure I was in the right account
Omg look up thesaurus Rex
That's what I am
Also today I had the opportunity to use the word ruminate. I don't even know where I got that word from, it just occurred to me in internal conversation to use it so I did
That's what everyone is
Yeah but I feel like I especially am
Like I am constantly using it
Whenever I am writing something for real
I wouldn't be surprised if I use it more than you
Bc macs have the built in dictionary and thesaurus
Also I already submitted my application
Oh then why discuss
And why do you do that
You have time
If you care about others input then you wouldn't do that
I wanted to try one essay on my own and submit a first draft to see what happens
Ok but
It's a stretch for Carleton anyway
Like if you just submit it and get rejected there are no conclusions to be drawn
It could be because of shortcomings of the essay or for other reasons, you will never know
But ok
I know, and quite frankly, I don't care all that much.
I've already thought it through.
But thanks for expressing how you feel.
So that was really bitchy unnecessarily
All I said is I wrote a bomb ass essay that I was proud of
I didn't ask for any help
You could have just said that
I did
You phrased it in a mean way
Phrased what?
I don't care if I get rejected
That's what I don't care about
The fly-in might make a difference but the supplements are what matter
Right but the way you mentioned that you didn't care about input was kinda mean
It doesn't matter at all
But it came off as dismissive AF instead of proud of yourself and confident 
I never explicitly said I don't care about input?
I never said that at all, as a matter of fact
"But thanks for expressing how you feel."
I said thank you for expressing how you feel about telling me it is a stretch 
Ok let's move on, text misunderstandings
I didn't mean to put it that way though
So I apologize
Anyway
I liked your essay a lot though
No it's ok
I have no plans this week except volunteering stuff. I want to work tonight at black crown or something but yeah.
I wish I could go to saaf this week but I have a google hangout interview at 6:30 :(
Google hangout interview?
Yeah for Brown Political Review
I hate Skype and hangout was the other listed option
What are you planning to work on tonight
Chinese homework, essays, game theory, reading bio packet, and British accents
Is hangout just IMing?
Or is it a voice call or something 
Pretty sure it's video 
Shit that's actually a lot
Is all of it minus the essays due tomorrow
How can you learn a British accent so fast
Game theory and bio packet are due in a week and on Thursday, respectively
You need a partner to practice speaking
I'm sitting at the bookmans park lot listening to folk music on NPR
Zayna was helping me after school
Anyway
I feel like I really bothered you today and you're probably super busy with your presentation and stuff so I guess I'll just drive home and then go work somewhere
Your GIF selection was wonderful though 
I'm not bothered at all
I feel bad for insulting you
Unintentionally
Sounds like you had a good time at bookman's
do you ever feel like you don't like talking to me about things
It was okay. I was really tired and peeved, so I pulled over by bookmans.
Not really, other than Israel 
:(
Hey sorry
Lol where are you
Audrey Hepurrn
I was at target
But they didn't have what I needed
And too many sorority girls
I wanted to vomit
For some reason I actually love the card design
It's the stereotypical trendy tween girl card but I love it 
Remember when I looked like I belonged in a gay fraternity with my toga and my purchase of ping pong paddled/balls
I said I would get work done but I haven't done anything yet besides nap. That's why I said hey sorry; I thought I slept for so long and I sent that without checking the time
How's your thing going
Also may I ask why you check ftm forums but choose to remove yourself from it publicly 
Lol yes and that gif
Lol you slept then for like 20 min?
I'm just chilling
I think it's precisely because I remove myself
But also its a bit compulsive
Did you at least do the Chinese homework
Can I tell you something
?
Yeah, like 15 minutes actually. 
I still don't understand (except for the compulsive part) but that's okay.
I haven't yet. It shouldn't take too long though
Ok so
This is super fucked up and idk if you'll get upset or not
There's really not a reason basically. I just do it because. Maybe I feel alone somewhere inside. But not conciliatory
But during lunch Jennifer said I should invite Oscar (she noticed we got along and "rapped nicki together" at Mady's) to Joseph's party since you'll be gone and Joseph said as long as I don't fuck in his bed
Eh
I think it's in poor judgment
But it's not like you said that
I honestly don't think he's that fun at parties, but that's my only objection
So you're actually not upset in any way?
No not really
I mean on one hand I hope you abstain for like a bit in acknowledgment of what we had and its length, but that is your choice and I won't judge you harshly. And also I'm not a huge fan of what Joseph said but I'm sure it was not in a mean tone. So no I'm not upset.
Yeah I don't think that im gonna want to do anything with anyone for a while, especially a week and a half after you leave 
*especially not
Do you feel the same way?
About that?
Like for yourself
My hypothesis about why you do it is because since you're so removed from it you want to understand if what you're feeling is normal. Or, it's a way for you to sympathize, even though you have an aversion to it. You still feel like you should understand, regardless.
What you're feeling is normal - compare your experiences to other ftm men
In terms of hormones and relationships and discrimination, etc.
I don't mean trans being normal lol
Sorry I should've rephrased
Anyway, back to original q
Regarding the abstention- 
In principle absolutely, but I feel that I cannot say for certain. Moving across the country alone is such a big shift, I will have no good friends. It's more difficult to say with certainty, I feel that I will feel lonely. I don't think I'll have sex quickly, though. 
I suppose but I really truly have already seen all there is to see
It is repetitive 
The posts at least
The pics can be interesting
I'm pretty sure I will abstain
I am just a bit afraid
Of what life without intimacy will be like
Of any form not just sex
I feel so comfortable with my body around you
Like I don't know
I feel like we've shared so much
You are literally the first person to see my dick in confidence
Idk :/
This is making me sad to think about
Like I literally feel like crying
And I worry so much because I hope that other people love your body the way I do
I don't think anyone ever will
Which is scary as fuck
But also draws me closer to you 
Like I really don't think it is possible to have a more considerate lover 
Except like you + the ability to feel when it's the wrong hole
I'm actually crying Aimee oh my god
This is so stupid
I'm sorry
Hahahah it's just dark sometimes!
In the light im always fine
Lol I would take you with your occasional ass pain rather than a judgmental normal person who didn't stick it in the butt
And day
Any day*
I think something truly beautiful is how after your surgery I wasn't repulsed in any way by your scars or anything
Like I still found you as attractive and beautiful as ever
And the most beautiful and hopeful thing to me is that I feel like you would feel and act the same way to anyone you truly cared about. If I was me but with some other kind of body I feel that you would feel the same way. I hope there are others like you 
Lol I don't think scars are at all repulsive in comparison to my 🌺 and 🍑
The way I think of it is that I care for you so much more than anyone in my life right now, and your being is composed of both your body and your mind, and both impress me every day.
That's what I've thought of every person I've ever been with
While I reflect on the past, each person still holds a special place for love in my heart.
It sounds cheesy but
^^how is this promotional video real?!!! Lol 
🌺💕🍑🐸💖👨‍❤️💋‍👨
👉🏾🌺
👬
😛
🌺
Modern Art
The video is gone omfg
I had to cum sorry
😘
No, you scroll down
Lol wow you couldn't help a brother out
And you say I'M selfish ahahah
Those girls look so concerned with academics
...And this is why I am not attending a public university
Literally it was girls like that at target and they were wearing sorority brand shirts; kills me every time
And seen them all week there like every time I go to target or so many fucking sorority girls 
When I imagine the sorority culture and the fraternity culture that's what I was imagining. That's what I don't want . At Dartmouth they were not that clearly blonde-elitist. Like it was legitimately about social interests and shit and of course all smart and motivated. Yeah the dressed like hos at parties and danced like them but it was all in good fun and without the exclusivity bs
Immediately after I saw the video I almost had an aneurism after asking myself what each and every single one of their majors could be.
Omg 
That is the best description 
But you misspelled aneurysm
And I thought it was disgusting how they have all this money going for editing and video production and aerial shots smh
I give it a nine out of 10
So, I give it a 9/10*
Right like that was one of the things I considered, how much money they had spent on that
Thank you for the correction!! That way I don't embarrass myself in the real world
I just wanted to be cheeky
The way you described Dartmouth frats made them seem a lot more appealing
No but seriously how do they get degrees
Yes there's drinking and brotherhood
They were so appealing
Right but it's like not douchey there
But there's also a deep sense of intellectual encouragement and specialization based on academic interest
The business major frat, the law-bound frat, etc.
But also kissing ass
I mean the whole concept like networking at all
Ok but at least they'll be the successful white men
Lol
Fair
I hope Charlotte doesn't get caught up in that
She's way too smart for those bitches
I can't imagine the U Alabama girls in class. Like I really really really can't.
Have you seen her snapchat story from today...
It seems like a lot of mindless conversation about Jake and the bitch who stole the blow dryer in the morning.
I think her story is gone by now I didn't see it
I feel like they are like Demi but more self-righteous
it's still there. Listen with volume. "KAPPA KAPPA KAPPA!!!!!!"
Lol iPhone dictation made Demi into dummy
OK I'll check again
Lol why are you using fiction
Lazy
I think Charlotte like I friended me on snapchat
Unfriended
Like her thing is gone
Lol
At least you're reducing your risk of chronic pain
Lol well the past week has been sorority video after video
No I'm kinda jealous lol
Of who?
U
Maybe I removed her accidentally  or she didn't have my number and my username is weird so she didn't know it was me 
I can't imagine she actively removed me
Sometimes I wish you lived nearby so I could walk over to your house and show you something funny, maybe fuck a little, and then walk back home
Lol maybe her sorority friends started by going through her contacts and deleting "fugly" usernames
Hahahah
Although I think metkonan sounds futuristic and tight
Dictation allows me to correctly write in Hebrew like spelling and shit
 too that would be so good
I know this is sore for you but there's no way I would've had anything with Sophia if she hadn't live so close
If you lived next door
My pussy would be rekt
🌚
I was wondering if you sent that laugh through diction lol. One problem I have with it is commas and periods though.
It doesn't punctuate 
Yes it doesn't do those 
Lol no 
Ha ha Ha ha ha that's what it makes of me laughing 
Don't ask me why one is capitalized
lol yeah I've thought about moving out of my house and camping outside of yours to get "the boy next door" experience with my already existent boyfriend
You really need to enunciate for  this shit to work
Why two spaces between 'for' and 'this'
Apple on some scurry shit
I can't see rekt without thinking of Rex
Ok anyway lol
No it's cos I had to edit the message and I didn't notice lol
Cos on my screen the for and this are on different lines
🆗🆒
Hahahah
G🌚🌚dnight 🙇🏽💕
G🌚dnight
God's night
Hasta mañana, baby
will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
Psalm 4:8
I will*
Oh my god get the fuck outa here
🌚
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
You did that intentionally, didn't you?
Sending me NYT links that only mbers have access to
Jk. You didn't know. But yeahhhhh...
I can't read it without membership
Lol I'm not logged in 
It directed me to the login?
Weird
Ok well I feel bad for keeping you up. Get some sleep and I'll see you tomorrow when you give a kick ass presentation.
"zero tolerance" for errors and imperfections
Question
Is there a dress code
Like how important is that
Don't dress in an alternative fashion
But tshirt and jeans will be fine
Ah yes
Today is the day the Docs come out
Docs meat docs
et
The what 
Doc Martens
What
I'm joking, obviously
Ok nvm
Oh
I get it
Lol
LOL
happy?
no.
Lol
Idk who I'm taking...
No one I guess lol
Maybe you should go w Martha
Great idea. I'm asking her now.
Ok and I'm curious
I bring nothing at all? Pens? Pencils? Notebook?
Don't think you need anything
Are you Emmett
Yes actually and this is fairly important
I was gonna mention it when I walked you guys in
He's an old and conservative guy, I'd really really prefer to not have this come up
Ok yeah I figured 
Why don't you just put it on the group chat?
I don't want in text idk
Like in speech it dissipates
Okay! Well I am really excited and I want to thank you a bunch
Lol don't get too hyped!
Not for this necessarily but everything lol
It takes two to tango
What's up
I was supposed to go w Martha but I can't find her? I'll just leave oh my own
Martha and Madeleine wanted to say happy birthday to lissa lol
Have you heard from jay?
Haven't seen him all day
Diviya and Nate weren't interested
I figured but I wish they had let me know earlier
Kinda pissed me off and made shit tough at the office
And Diviya tried to dodge my question 
Like I wouldn't have cared I just need a straight answer 
And prompt
Nate described it as Diviya only being interested if it was a Harvard doctor connection 
I'm here btw
Do I just go to the front
Yes
Where are you
Watch yo self 
I feel that it is time to change my name on Facebook
Thoughts?
DO IT
Be the bitch you want to be
I'm in a very assertive mood right now. I'm at bookmans, reading bitchfest
What is that book
It's a compilation of feminist essays
I ran into Sabrina at bookmans
We finished talking maybe 40 seconds ago. She's hardcore drugs.
She told me if I go to evergreen find Jobi (the hookup)
What do you mean hardcore drugs
Hookup for drugs? Jobi is a drug name
I meant hardcore drug user mentality. Only acid and shrooms though.
Is it good
Oh
She's getting a green card
What do you mean mentality
Wow I didn't know she was an illegal
Only a green card now?
(Lol)
Lol she started off by saying, "find people with green cards" and I was like "what makes illegals so special?"
Only legals have green cards tho?
Lol anyway
Is that really all she talks about
It might be a phase
Right but people usually attain them after being illegal in the U.S. For a while
We were a bit the same way at one point
No?
My parents had them right after legally immigrating
You get them for legal immigration too
But you are right they may have that connotation 
In that illegals becoming legals get them too
I thought it would be something an illegal would get to attend college so that was my reasoning
She said she didn't participate in any clubs or things bc she was high all the time, and she showed up to lots of classes high
Jobi is a drug name lol
How would I know that
Did the professor say anything to you after
May I say that I was/am inspired by you and I am proud of the things you have done
And like you probably really don't believe me or think I mean it but yeah
I feel like you made such a transformation from May-now and I think I'm also capable of doing the same
Lol my mom left the garage open accidentally all day on the day we receive a $50K check (which was supposed to automatically deposit electronically and not be sent) all good tho
What transformation do you think I made?
I feel that you and our friends but especially you have already transformed, and inspired my evolution.
So I thank you too
That's really sad actually
That she was high and didn't do shit
He said something nice when he gave me the certificate, that I was excellent or something, I don't remember specifically. 
But after that no because he had to rush to a meeting
Also, in a sense I feel I changed, in another sense I feel I just returned to the academic being I was prior to senior year and especially prior to junior year, when I had greater requirements 
I just remembered this humorous quote that I read in this book yesterday and it was saying against what Mr. Yager said "chemistry is not in fact the study of how chemical dumping affect society nor the study of how society affects chemical dumpers. This was in response to Yager's desire to focus Science education around societal problems within the paradigm called science/technology-society
I feel like you're not too shy anymore and you're willing to work to get what you want
Even though you say that I still feel very dumb
Yeah I'm mainly talking about this academic state and getting shit done
Anyway
Idk right now so
I'm just a little worried to see how things will be once you're gone because you don't want to be with me and all
Also, I'm eating some roasted red pepper hummus crackers (made from real garbanzo bean) and they taste like peas
lol that's funny how of all days your mom forgets to close the garage. Although wouldn't it be in the mail regardless?
Sorry I'm at the family friend's
You know I was never clear on why the fact that the house was open was relevant to the check
I agree with that sentiment kind of. I think I am still somewhat shy, but less!
You aren't dumb bb
What do you mean "since I don't want to be with you"?
That doesn't sound appetizing
Lol yeah neither do I. The open house is a problem on its own hahahah.
That safe zone sign in the telemedicine room hahah
I also agree; more confident but not completely completely.
It's impressive progress though
How is the family friend today? Also, how did she turn out (socially, etc.) with all of the incestuous stuff that happened?
Yeah, like you know how you don't want to be with me when you leave? I don't know what will be appropriate to talk about with you
The concept of breaking up just because you're going somewhere - even though we've had a great relationship when you were in Cali - is bizarre to me.
Like that its planned and you're okay with it
Like you just don't care
Hi sorry just got home
She is pretty good, actually. But awful with money. That is the greater issue. Also she gets depression sometimes. Overall pretty normal. She's not very educated so it's not like she spends her free time reading Shakespeare but she has a fulfilling life.
It's not at all that I don't care
But I really don't think it's possible to maintain in the long term, and so I'd prefer to make it a clean break and for us to continue as good friends, and we will figure out what that means. I feel that the alternative is a long slow and painful decline, because I just don't think long distance works. 
It's not at all that I don't care
I think it will spare both of us pain
Hi
Yo yo yo
I just woke up and I dreamt about you 
I was so sad because you didn't want to work a minimum wage job with me and you decided to work at a gas station instead
Then you were like, "it's ok though. I still like you only because you gave me good 😛🌺 and I have hickeys on my 🌺."
She sounds like an average American, not gonna lie; and there is no problem with that.
I have thought about it a few times. Obviously there was the Anthony thing and what we have is a lot stronger, so I think about what would happen if we are emotionally committed but allow others to satisfy us sexually. Then it comes down to a lot more things, involving personalities, and that's probably something you don't want to talk about hahah.
The theory that there is always SOMEONE better for you no matter what.
I believe that's true, but if I care about someone so much then that consideration doesn't even come across my mind
Anyway, you are not awake and I shouldn't be? Haha. I had the best time today and I'm glad you invited me to be a part of it.
G🌚🌚DNIGHT 💕🐢
we should specialize in creating custom greetings/colloquialisms by using emojis
I reaaaaally hope I see you tomorrow after your Google hangout interview
There is nothing I look forward to more than that
*In an email about why people should sign up to be 4-H healthy living ambassadors*
Rural area candidate: "travel opportunities? Yeah, I mean I guess I would like to meet random black men... Yay for traveling. Who even is that in the picture!"
Also when you get a chance can you define nuanced for me and give me an example?
Starbucks launched wine and craft beer sales today, oh my goodness
They're SOOO targeting white people. It's not even inconspicuous at this point.
Jk kinda but it's pretty funny
Yes let's hang out tonight. Where?? Maybe something other than black crown lol
Lol rural candidate = 80% republican. He's probably hoping he can strike some nerve while they shake hands such that Obama goes into a coma
At least Biden is white 
Or kill Biden too cos the speaker of the house is republican 
Lol Starbucks be targeting whites since 1976
Or whenever the fuck they opened
White people gotta stop at Starbucks at 5 am to get their morning buzz
It's funny because I know the guy who is shaking his hand and he is very Latino/Hispanic
Before they go to a productive job in which they work 10 hours a day
To support their dog, stay at home wife, and 3 kids
He's a bodybuilder
Lol really? You would think they would pick an obviously ethnic kid if an ethnic kid at all. Oh well, Obama can make up the ethnic quota for the pic
I guess it depends for tonight. Do you need to work or read or something?
Nope
Lol yeah. What's kinda fucked up is that the main link in Tucson between 4-H and youth is the farm camp, which targets marketing at select schools and is $500 per student  
Volunteering isn't as exclusive, thanks to Tucson High's farm camp
Latino parents go to the club fair
They think their kid will empathize with the kid's grandparents
Then the kids go to fuckin DC for a weekend lol and go to a "farm" for healthy living and nutrition
Sometimes I worry about the millennials in the U.S. and how there's the entire anti-kid movement, but then I remember the south/rural areas exist.
Elizabeth's snaps were great
Do you think 4-H is effective
It's beautiful how she decided to capture the library of all places
And also, is the whole Tucson village farm affiliated with 4-H?
Lol she spends so much time there
Mr. Science, do you know why assholes burn?
It makes a lot of sense to me
She hated being at home and didn't have internet there, so library it was. 
Also nuanced
It means that an argument or something has small but important facets or distinctions. That it isn't general, it has caveats or sophistications.
It has subtle pieces that are important to it
But it is also a buzzword
That just like means
Colloquially it has connotation that whatever you are talking about that is nuanced is well-thought-out, and unique. 
You know, Ivies really don't have a need to charge tuition at all
Ok maybe brown does because they broke as hell
But Harvard, Yale, probably Princeton lol no
It's effective for people who are in the loop. Some schools have 4-H clubs and things like that, but it's selective. The farm itself is a UA project, but 4-H asked to connect it to the youth.
They make so much money off of their endowment (money in the bank) that they could continually pay for 100% of charged tuition room and board without any issue
Fuck them 
Yeah I think about that all the time
But if they have the opportunity to exploit the privileged, why not? You know?
Sure but they could at least be nicer
Actually actually
At least they cover a bunnnnchhhh for people who need it
Thinking about it
It helps the elite
If they were free
So many more would apply
And the elite would be drowned out and less would attend, and less would donate later on
Sure but that bunch is a drop in the proverbial bucket
It's like affirmative action
It doesn't help poor people as a whole 
It sure makes it look like they care though
the reason many 'poor' don't apply to those schools is because I don't think all of them are aware of how much financial aid is provided and the stereotype is that the schools are for the elite
Exactly
It already does help the elite, but I think that's changing
No they really don't know how much is available at all
I mean in general terms yes
I think the expansion of schools like BASIS (one pro) is the integration of youth from all backgrounds
Better now by far than 50 years ago
And the dream that each kid can go to an ivy
Lol but on such a small scale
So in that respect, it's small but growing 
I assure you that not many kids go to a BASIS with integration
Not many BASIS schools have integration in fact
The new schools in Phoenix, I hear they are overwhelmingly white/Indian/Asian
No yes it's growing
But at a stupid rate
Can I bring the clothes for you today
But I get your perspective-- it worked out for you, why not others
Holy shit
I read this article:
Which provided fodder for the discussion with you
Then I talked to my mom
And she was like: yeah over 20 years that's ridiculous and they must be investing in start-ups to make 36%, but in terms of stocks, the market tripled since the low point in 08-09. So you could triple your $ just by investing in the index and not even making strategic choices. In fact, investing in real estate, not only did I make like 10% a year from rental fees, the value of the houses also doubled since I bought them
Wtf
She was like "I bought a house for $43K and now worth $110K"
Well I wouldn't know, it seems that the schools are in pretty racially diverse places. My only problem is the private school with tuition in NY, but I know that's not BASIS's fault.
What's funny is how I didn't even read the article, yet I'm still able to talk about it
Like I spoke from experience
And observations 
Lol welcome to my life
AP Lit
I mean the idea from Yale is that they save more so that they can make more in the future 
But it has become a bit absurd
I'll talk to you later! I have school but I'll reply during free period 
Ok
L8r G8r
Check out Munk Debates. The concept is really cool. And the winner is chosen by which side manages persuades more to switch to their side, not which side agrees with one more. So the debate "be it resolved that men are obsolete" was won by the pro side by a wide margin. Though the method seems like it could falter to bias in that the people who come into the room feeling that way probably are radical and feel that way deeply, it's about 50/50 on whether the radical side wins.
What are jay and Elizabeth doing as a result of liz's departure
Jay told me that she's going out to dinner with him and his family
Yes you can bring the clothes haha
Fuck colleges have so much money. Holy shit.
I looked Munk Debates up! The concept is fascinating; it is open on my computer. I was reading the transcript for the liberal arts education during my free period and I am going to watch a video today.
How was your day
Pretty good. I found out that I love doing cold reads and I get very into my character. Auditions are this Monday!
When I see you today I have to tell you about why I now think Rosinbum is pretentious, thanks to Rex
Reks 
My mom made the BEST enchiladas for dinner
How was your day?
 
HSM Valentine's Day cards
If I go to Hampshire college I'll be part of the 5 colleges and I can take classes at Amherst?!'bbbb
Ya I thought I told you that hahaha
Haha ok I'm excited to hear
I want enchiladas :(
I need to try every kind of xican food before I go
So that I can cherish it
Omg Ryan was so gay
Ok so I can actually attend Hampshire but not take any classes with them
Like how does it work
Yes!!! I was say I could bring you some but they might get gross
We should hit up a bunch of xican restaurants though
There's a tea place everyone suggested to me today. It's called savaya, and it's on Broadway and Campbell
Unfortunately
Amherst specifically has a policy that you can only take 2 courses there per semester
 That's still pretty good
At least I'll have Amherst connections
And get invited to their wild parties
And besides that it seems that not all courses are available for cross-registration, though I don't know to what extent 
Lol for sure
Yeah it's definitely a big "in"
And maybe if you take two courses a semester there for the first two years and feet great grades you could apply to transfer
You can apply to transfer any time within your 4 years, correct?
Yep
Though depending on the requirements and how they accept your credits it may take beyond 4 years to graduate
And to think I only found out about this because Kittredge emailed me this morning, lol.
I would've been fucked.
When I read it earlier today I was so happy
Amherst is my dream
Lol I really thought I mentioned the consortium. Maybe you didn't know what a consortium entails
Apply to Wesleyan b
Or the other New England ones, not as great as Amherst maybe, but similar
Seriously though Amherst is bomb
Today when I was reading lines I said "he's always breeding everywhere" instead of "bleeding everywhere" lol
Good luck on the hangouts interviews
!!
Hi
Let's hang
Where you at
I kinda sucked but that's ok
I don't care
I'm at home lol
Lol maybe it was a Freudian slip
I'm sorry :(
Nah it's cool
You'll tell me about it, I presume
Actually it was kinda doomed cos he had awful Internet so I couldn't understand
Plus British accent
I'll be there soon
Ummmm just a DC
I mean in 20
Oh ok lol
Lol I can't teleport
lol I know but you made it sound like you were close
Here
OKAYAYYAYYYY 
Sorry that was an accident
Damn
Lol
Ulitza is now dating Abi's ex
Lol not surprising
Oh but he's not cute
He's just ghetto
I hate the chin hair so much
Baby 💯💋
💯💯💯
It's funny how even emojis are ghetto
🌚
ur getto 
get toe

Morning inspiration from my mom:
 But joyful are those who have the God of Israel as their helper, whose hope is in the Lord their God.	Psalm 146:5 (NLT) 
Yes. I feel very joyful now.
Who knew that was the secret
All mental illnesses are cured
Wow
I feel 150% better about everything in the world
I always used to say 150% about things until Anthony told me to stop because 150% doesn't exist
You're out of this world 🌞
Hey bb boy
How was your day
*Today in drama*
Nikka: you guys, this play is a little more mature. There might be some lines that you won't feel comfortable saying, but we ARE advanced drama. Anyway, all the good things in life aren't family friendly."
Lol so I'm not working today
Wtf
Did you get fired 
My day is ongoing
I'll chat you soon
No, it was on-call. I'm working tomorrow and Sat. though
Ok I'll talk to you soon!
Hi
What up
I was checking my email when you messaged me, but that was a distraction from the New Jim Crow
What's up with you?
I am on my way home
Can I pick you up? I was planning to go to bed bath and beyond, if you wanna come, cool, if not I'll pick you up after
My mom wants me to eat dinner at home first, I'm sorry.
I think later would be okay
Irrational Man at 7?
I'll pick you up around 6:39
6:30
I can meet you somewhere if you want
Ok nvm actually mom is taking the car lol
What's up
Still dinner?
Yes
I love two hour dinners
That's a thing in my family
Lol Ok I jest
Wait diehard
Sorry that was a butt dial it was supposed to say what's actually going on
Lol nothing's going on
I'm waiting for you
I finished my hw
K
K
What does that mean
On my way be there in 8
Cu
Here
"8"
Whoops traffic
I am walking and I can feel wetness dripping down my legs
🌸😍
Do you ever see me wave to you
Sometimes
The 8th grade girl who had a crush on me posted this on snapchat
Fuck I think I left my wallet in your car
Where
Probably back seat
Can you come back right now?
Lol jk
Whenever I see you
Ya ok I found it
I'll bring it when I see you
Probably Saturday or something
I
K
When u go sleep u tell me
Not yet
The funny pictures people in my church share, lol
Is that lady nice
I hate how vague NPR is all the time in their articles. 
She's so sweet, but very unintelligent. She's in her 60s and she's going to college to learn basic algebra.
I think she has a disability 
ntal
Vague?
Thats pretty sad actually
Do you think most of the church people are a bit unintelligent
I read an article a few minutes ago about how a kid recognized that schools don't teach people things, and that independent study is more effective. The article was not compelling in any way and the kid was just as stressed out.
I really do. A lot of them went to community colleges (both kids and adults) or just live on their plots of land and tend the animals.
The people bring fresh goat cheese and wine and shit
There are a select few, of course
I disagree with that sentiment so much
Oh they are rural?
So do I. I enjoy being well-rounded and I claim credit to school.  
A lot of them are. Many live in those community homes that all look the same, and usually on the outskirts 
🌚
Ew
lol 🌚
It was so depressing to hear Kittredge talk to Demi in CC and say there's a chance she won't get into the UA 
Also she wants to go to college for cheer
He actually said that?
That's depressing as fuck
Did you open my snap
He literally said that... He told her she needs strong letters and essays and that every move she makes this year matters
Today in research Rosinbum had us go to the MPR during 9th grade lunch to "observe" them lol
Joseph and Jennifer are going to Amsterdam together
Isn't that insane
He called her from California and was so excited and stuff
They're gonna be house sitting for a month and a few weeks
I did open your snap haha and that is fucking insane. Thank God you have some visuals.
Would you be able to drop off my wallet at savers?
Actually nvm we can breakfast tomorrow?
Have you ever noticed that the more formal ways of saying bathroom progressively are more euphemistic? Shitter > toilet > bathroom > restroom > men's room
Luck to Demi.
What did you observe? That rosinbum didn't plan a lesson?
Her mom agreed? That sounds awesomeness
Awesome!*
Yeah. I need to figure out the weekend plan tonight 
:(
I feel so shitty
He did plan a lesson, only they're bizarre ones
Why feel shitty
I answer
Why u no answer 
I wish I had every day this week to spend with you
I'm so sad
 I'm probably gonna get out of work at 2am
So there's that
:(
That's so ridiculous
Like absurd
 Yeah i have noticed the more euphemistic thing. It's like the bodily functions are repulsive enough to change the name
How was your day today
Tell me all about it
Btw My lunch ends at 8:30
How early are you willing to wake up tomorrow
Sorry b I was shopping :(
My day was busy as hell but I got cake
They got me cake and after 5 minutes the doc was like "run along you have a paper to complete" and I was like damn
I can get up whenever
Shitting is a hobby of mine. I actually really enjoy it.
You don't use your phone while doing it?
Where were you shopping?
What were you getting 
Lol how sympathetic, the doctor
I went to office max
Suddenly my mom is all about high quality shit
So I bought two of these bound hard cover notebooks made in Poland $12 each
For yourself?
Each time I got something by mom was like "are you sure you don't want these? They look solid. <2x more expensive>"
Yeah
I really benefit from taking notes
Writing them down, not computer.
So I got one for each of my lecture courses. Idk what I will need for the labs
Computer notes suck ass
I only retain info when I write it
Same
I'm worried about how tomorrow will work bc I have so much to do
I have to go clothes shopping, work, see you (maybe in morning?), pack for D.C., and party
What you got?
What do you mean
We can meet not do morning if you want
Never mind you answered
What do you want to do?
How early we talking tomorrow
Breakfast at like cafe passé
6:30
Or ghini's
Lol jk. What time works for you?
Wait is that a joke
Ok good
9:30 is good for me lol
Ok that'll be good for me too. Do I meet you or?
Is 9 ok?
Ya
Let's meet at 9
Ok :) what's up with you right now?
How are you feeling
Tired AF
but watching kings man
Kingsman
I've been wanting to see that damn it
Did you rent it?
Also I had like a glass of margarita
And it just made me tired
No.......
Lol? Your mom make it?
I miss u ugh
It was in the fridge and de we both had one
How is work going
Why can you text
I'm on break now
It ends in like a minute lol
Lol I can't believe ur mom but that's wonderful!
Work is going okay. I need to find out what time I'm working tomorrow though
:(
4pm-10:30pm lol
But it's on call
I hope I don't have to
Why dad 
Sent sad
Why da
Why sad lol
Sergio can't speak
How is kings man?
It's pretty cool actually yo
:O
Am I annoying u
Nah nah
Nah
Nah
Enjoy your time at work as much as you can b
If you don't have work we could sho
Shop
Will u say goodnight before you sleep
Ya
Ok good I need to know my bb goes to bed safe and sound
🌚
So probably no breakfast. I got home a minute or two ago.
Ok that's crazy :(
Did you send the free the nipple snap cos it's an Instagram thing
What do you mean
It's an everything thing
I didn't know it was a thing
I thought you were just weird
Kingsman was fucking fantastic
Like really really great
How did you find out
Is it on Netflix?
Niet... 
Fuckin diviya
Hello?
Yes
Are you upset?
Work made me really upset about the world and humanity. Also, because many of the people there depend on work so much the company isn't giving any time off in October. Everyone needs to work 6 days a week, and since I told them Monday is the only day I can't work.... Yeah
And I wish I could sleep over at your place and idek if I can go or not yet
If everyone depends on work why aren't they willing to stick it on others? I don't understand. 
What were their dreams before things went to shit?
Can't you come over after work?
No I don't want to sound stupid and annoy you. How are you today
What's up
No please tell me
Do you have a movie that's next on the list
Yeah I don't understand either! I expressed my concerns about being underage and working those hours, and the manager was like "well tonight you're not underage hahahah"
I said I was part time and that I go to school and run clubs and go volunteer 
Have you begun to enjoy it more?
I'll tell you about the dreams later
Sergio this is not healthy. This is your year to focus on school.
I could come over after work (if I am working tonight. Idk yet. I hope I m not) 
You can find another better job, seriously. One where they respect your hours.
Yes, do that.
If I come over after work I could get there at 11 and I can't stay the night so
Why can't you stay the night
I have a flight tomorrow morning
What time
10:30
So
That's like late
All you have to do is wake up at 7
It'll be fine
I really want to wake up on time though
If the flight was at 7 I would be concerned
You will!
Seriously we can set hella alarms
I've done this before, I fly 5x a year+
What's an ideal bedtimes
Considering you can sleep on the flight, and that you won't get to DC until like... 6pm local time
Can we also do something Friday night?
I would say around 1:30
Yes
Ok so keep that night free
I'll try
You leave Saturday at what time
Dunno
Whenever
Probably 9-11 AM
My dad likes an early start but we suck at being on time when no one will guilt us for being late so
Usually ends up being in that range
You know, many people who end up nowhere in middle age were earlier pretty successful. I can think of a good few examples. Very depressing
Oh shit
I recognize the issues with the Down syndrome kid and I don't know how I feel about that BUT
The guy in this article is with my doctor (Olson), that shit is really mean. 
P. 72 is her "lesbian wedding" as the gender trended bullshit article says 
I saw the guy's name and Los Angeles and Olson in his last name and I was like haha wouldn't it be funny if my doctor became a guy, and then I was like damn whoa they are like actually married 
Hey sorry I'll read it soon I was out for lunch
My mom told me that before she left DEA and while we were going to move she was looking for homes in your area and found one
But then we moved with grandpa
How that would have changed our life together
I'm at JCP now getting khakis and polos (super nice ones) and dockers shorts 
Why the shorts :OOo
Are you gonna die
My mom was so sweet because I told her tonight is my last night to sleep with you and she told me to make sure I pack and stuff so I can go
Awwww
Shorts because I've been wanting sexy formal shorts above the knees
Not necessarily for DC but still
What size are your khakis
30x30 is way too big for me
28 x 30
And 28 x 28
And one 26 x 28
Oh you mean like chubbier
Chubbies
Not like normal docker gross white trash shorts
And the 28 x 30 is too big really
But 26 x 28 is tight as hell so I am stuck
You're gonna think this is so white trash but I got a long sleeved polo
No way
Your mother must be proud
Send me your British accept
Accent
You sound Bostonian in the last one lol
I used to be obsessed with Harry Potter and hermione was my favorite character and I used to say all her lines in her accent
I get off work around 8:30 today! 
I can be at your house before 9
I still haven't had a chance to read the stuff about your doctor but I will
Also yeah about the middle aged people. I watched this homeless YouTube series about people's lives before they were homeless and it's depressing
The people you wouldn't expect
That's great!!
I am picking up 
I'm gonna watch the spectacular now
You're gonna pick me up?
Or you are picking other people up and won't be home?
Or you're picking up the concept of homeless people being successful in the past?
That movie is depressing but I like it a lot
I have a dinner party before so I can't, sorry
I am picking up 🍸
From who? Jay's friend?
What time should I be at your house
Ya
like 8:15 
Ok enjoy your movie then
Sorry I am still out
And driving
Did you see oscar's snaps??
So
I can pick you up on the way back from the dinner party, what time would work
Which snaps
I told you I work until 8:30
Story
right sorry
Ok
I'm out early
Anyway I'll see u later then
No I'm coming
What?
My mom is on her way
I was only letting you know
Because I can get to your house before people
But if I don't then idk what you'll do
I know you're uncomfortable with going off and staying there
Hi
Are you coming?
I am so pissed off because the store only had all the weird flavors of Hawaiian punch and not the regular juicy red
I'll be there in 3
Great!
Here
Lies
😍
Haha hello
I want to leave on good terms with my family but they're watching Fox News and praising trump
Trumpy LOL
turns out I'm not sleeping with Jennifer but I have a roommate from another state
Just bow down to trump
He won't win anyway
Fox News acts like he could but he couldn't
How do you feel about that
I'm feeling trumpy
I mean grumpy and frumpy. That's what trumpy means
Hey
You know I'm actually scared about trump winning. There's been so much acceleration in the support rates 
I identify as trumpy. Tramp and grumpy.
Idk it's gonna be kinda weird obviously but what if he becomes my new brother
I tried shitting it all out this morning so I didn't have to on the plane but I feel like it wasn't all that I could, you know?
So I'm going to Texas, Virginia, Maryland, and D.C. 
Hahahahahaha
Is that the flight path? To Texas?
Yeah it is
I just boarded
What airline
United
Did you crash
Did you get food
Is your seat nice
Window seat?
Flying was fun although I had a mini heart attack when I was in a cloud lol
It felt like riding a mechanical bull
Yeah well a flight to Texas involves listening to southern accents and cussing lol
What a difference
I'm really tired because Jennifer and I spent the entire time talking and staying up, but I only got like 3 hours of sleep
Are you planning to sleep on the next flight?
And what airport are you flying into? Ronald Reagan or Dulles?
(I know airports)
Yeah probably gonna sleep.
We are going to Reagan. What do you know about it?
The pictures looked really nice
Idk not much. Are you boarded already
Hey
I'm here
What time is it over there?
5:20
How is it so far 
There's a gay Louisianan 
He's half black
Also it's really fuckin pretty
If someone stationed me here I would love it
Ok well I hope you're having a good night
Sleep well!
Sorry
Stationed?
Is he cool
I have been out today
Hiking etc
:(
Did you do the night hike
Who went
No I went with parents
To catch frogs
Everyone is so quiet
Jennifer and I are the only fun ones
There are a lot of white girls on their phones
We got pizza delivered for the AZ and Louisiana groups
Awesome! How did it go
How have you been today
I walked into my room and my roommate had an iPad and Oreos sitting out but he was gone lol
:( white people
I have been great! Movies and rest. 
Lol
Do they seem like rich boring smart ivy kids
Which movies?
I fell asleep on my way to DC 
I ate Wendy's and pizza lol
No they're kinda hick-ish
There are some rich Arabs though
The spectacular now, and the boys in the band (not very good), also one movie with Reyna called laggies which was flawed but funny
Lol that's pretty funny
How was Wendy's
It's almost 11 here and my roommate still isn't back yet
Thoughts on the spectacular now?
His college essay pissed me off bc he ain't gettin into no schools with that
Lol and his timing was so off
Like after the school year he is writing this essay?
His girl already got into college and he's still writing? The time doesn't really line up
lol yeah I didn't even think of that. It's pretty late for me too
So overall it was fine but
I felt that it didn't go as deep as it could with his alcoholism
It's so stupid how she forgave Him after she got hit
It like brought things up, implied things, and didn't explore
But he was drunk and emotional about his dad...
But yeah
And the nature of their relationship was constantly unclear
Maybe that was the point, the ambiguity, but it pissed me off
I thought that because teenagers are perceived as inconsistent and irrational that was the way the movie was formatted and written
She was the only mature one of them all
Oh so Reyna did another one of her "stay the day" things
Only til 12
When she was drunk and out she lost a sandal and a towel outside. My mom asked me about it, she was like wtf
That's a good explanation
Also possibly induced by his alcoholism and how he placed emphasis on others rather than himself so he didn't work out his feelings
We hot
I see
That's so sad. Nobody suspected that she was fucked up or anything. We all thought her and Veris were doing things.
Also I'm surprised Veris didn't call anyone
Yeah he's all about the relationships around him
It wasn't until the end where he sits to write his paper and reflect
He did pretty quickly
I don't think she was barfing for all that long before we came
Ya
It's a panorama
There was a new mountain fire today
Small
I flew over it
Did you see it?
Why is the roomie out?
What is he doing 
I'm rooming with a gay southern boy!!!!
He lives on a farm in Tennessee lol
And then another southern Tennessee boy but whatever 
They're all cool
I did see it
They were getting pizza
I love that panorama so much
They used the word nigga
That makes me a bit uncomfortable
But I suppose it would be interesting to see his perspective on his sexuality being from there
The word nigga?
No
That you are rooming with another gay
I felt uncomfortable when u were at tufts :/
Oh ok 2 boys
Lol that guy was grossssssssssss
And a virgin
Yeah but the weird thing is that the gay one is for Ben Carson and the non gay one is for sanders
#tranniesagainstobama
Lol what
Explain yourself
What's wrong
I'm the only urban kid
They call me the urbaner
Another kid from Utah came in like two minutes ago
He said "if any gays come to my city they would get killed"
I need your love
I'm gonna die
Ok goodnight :(
Hi
Hi
Lol
Sorry
Lol urban we
Urbaner
I saw the light on my phone just now sorry
Wasn't ignoring
Where in Utah
Is he in your room?
He lives in northern Utah by Wyoming and some other state
The Bernie kid's dad is the dean of the university of Tennessee 
Yeah he's in my room
The dean?
You mean a dean?
Like universities have many deans
Ew
What a sad place to live
Covertly snap a photo?
Yeah just a dean
🌚
Sleeping before you shockingly
He's a ginger
Hahaha funny bc it's only 12:29 here and 9:29 there
Goodnight!!! 🌚
חשנא 
Sorry
Have a great day
Omfg
I ran into your mom at the hospital
She didn't see me hallelujah
She wears those massive white clunky shoes with white socks what
Didn't think she was the type
Ummmm she has to work out in the morning?
Like she has physical therapy
Sexually transmitted inflections
Gay talk
What are you talking about
Did you contract one
Ok then
Bye
Hi 
Sorry
I am working
It's just funny
Sexually transmitted INFLECTIONS
I actually didn't see that
I thought it just said infections
uhUUUHHH oooohOOH
Inflections can literally be transmitted
 
So gay
It's almost 3 and I'm only grabbing lunch now
Worked straight from 9 until now no breaks
I'm sorry :(
That sucks so bad
I'm getting dinner now. They gave me intense kosher meals prepared and sealed in kosher kitchens lol....
What are you gonna eat?
Jennifer and Joseph call/text each other so much lol
Like we finished dinner and we have to go to yoga now but Jen and Joseph are on the phone
So I'm just sitting in a teen lounge waiting
I had one small burger because it was cheap and I forgot my credit card
So I rounded up some backpack change
I think they talk over phone a lot, but probably not as much text as we do sometimes
But I mean idk
How is that
Be in the financial know!
Sorry that was for the tortoise didn't know it was recording
Oops
You send your tortoise recordings lol?
No no
I was telling her to wake up, jokingly
And while that was happening I hit record and didn't notice lol
Oh lol I thought you spoke during work and sent recordings to your mom for your tortoise
How was work?
*During yoga class*
Teacher: breathe and you might feel light headed. It's like a natural high. But that's the only type of high you should ever be!
*audience members start clapping*
They text a lot too
I'll read tonight!
Hey I hate to say this but I need my new Jim Crow back
Also I defend my comment about your mom's outfit. She looked like 1995.
Work was fine, but I anticipated being done after today. It was my last day in the office, but I still have a solid couple hours of work
Lol who clapped? What context?
Ok that was really rude
Like I don't appreciate hearing that
Ok it's just an outfit Sergio
We all have our off days
Wasn't meant to be a personal attack!
Sorry :(
I don't deny that my mom sometimes looks like 1985
yeah I'm planning on giving you the book back. I don't think I can finish it hahha, but you probably already figured that out
You have work right now? Awww I'm sorry. I hope you get it done soon!
Do you want your own copy? Do you think you would otherwise read it?
I'm gonna do it tomorrow
Lol some moms clapped right after the comment 
I would read it except I've been busy, obviously
At the 4-H conference dance party
Sergio: damn I really want to twerk 
A southern girl from Arkansas taught yoga lol
What're you doing tonight?
Ok well goodnight
Hey sorry are you actually going to sleep
I was working on some shit
Lol of course Arkansas would say that
I'm cleaning up, might watch a movie later, probably won't work
Wbu
No I'm not but I keep forgetting the time difference so I assume you're asleethe 
I'm at a dance party
Is it fun
What movie might you watch tonight?
It's awesome because we have no bedtime 
Last night I was up until 1:30
Breakfast is from 7-9am
It's a lot of fun. Everyone gets down
Sergio: mormon boners when they touch hands
The Utah kids only got up to dance for Life is a Highway and Cotton eye joe
Tennessee DJ: leave room for Jesus
Louisiana girl: Jesus is already in my heart so
I am watching the Boys in the Band and it is so confusing
It's like gay references that aren't relevant 
And the cast is mostly gay, except the super flamboyant gay who is portrayed by a straight actor
Weren't you tired?
I am so glad to not be there lol, I would hate it
What do the straight boys do
Lol Utah 
Also it's hilarious that the DJ is saying that
I haven't heard that shit since ever
What song is that I can't hear 
What's that movie about?
It was some country song that referenced Arizona, but it's a glimpse of the country music they've been playing
The southern kids turned Spanish music (requested by the Puerto Rican representatives) into a line dance
Not really. Madeleine got me sick :(
Lol I doubt you would hate it. The kids are actually so nice. My roomies make fun of my accent lol and we stayed up late talking
The only thing though would be the humidity outside!!!!
The straight boys also dance. 
They're more fun that our straight boy groups 
Like even as a gay I can actually talk to them and we laugh and make jokes. They're more relatable.
Lol I haven't heard that shit since never. It's honestly a first.
It's about a group of gays in 1968 who somewhat accidentally invite a straight boy
What accent? The gay one?
I'm glad you enjoy their company, someone has to
My roommate is listening to country music in the shower
Have I been annoying today lol
A straight boy into the gay friendship group? What is it? An AIDS support group or something?
That's not funny
He's a college friend of one of the guys
And most of the actors died of AIDS later
And no you haven't been annoying
What's not funny
I'm not making a joke about anything
I was joking
Cos earlier you were like "that's so rude" about what I said
I felt I had the same party-pooping right
Ok. But what you said was actually kinda rude
It's different when people say the decade thing about your mom bc it comes from a place of admiration 
With you, not so much
Ok but what you said conformed to a stereotype which has pained many people
That's not true
??? You said it's about a group of boys who accidentally invited a straight boy without giving any context whatsoever
I was asking questions
Was it for a sleepover
Anyway 
Have you thought about breaking up before you leave?
Like what are your thoughts
Sergio seriously I was joking
Lol no not for a sleepover though that would be sexy
For a dinner party, somewhat but not really similar to Cage Aux Folles
I want to hear your thoughts first
Idk I feel like you don't really care about me anymore and
I guess whatever you want to do with that information is whatever you do
I feel like you are upset with me tonight
So let's drop this topic for now
I'm actually not upset
I wod rather talk about this now
I would rather talk in person. And even if you aren't upset, you seem far from neutral, saying that I don't care. That's not true at all. It's probably influenced by the fact that I have been bad at messaging today.
 if you want to talk in person there's obviously something you also have to say
And like especially because you asked me
What?
Lol the one straight guy at the gay sleepover would be sexy
He would probably feel really uncomfortable
Yeah I want to know what you think
You also already know how I feel about the whole thing
I was only expressing how I thought things were on your side
But you already know what I think about what happens with us
You're the one who switches between being only friends when you leave to breaking up to watching movies as a date
What?
Sergio I think I have made it clear that I want us to be friends
If you can't handle talking and watching movies when I'm gone then I can abandon that venture, it was never meant as dates, just to stay close
Ok yeah so do you think it'd be best to end it now
No, because I think we should hang out when you come back and it would be awkward AF 
Ok
Ok?
??
I guess this is because I'm upset and I would rather get over it sooner
And because you take this stuff better than I do
It's like I'm leaving this part of my current life and you're going on to the next part of yours
I'm not denying that's true, but I think it would be best to make the most of what we have now, and stay together and be happy together for the last few days. This argument of "it's futile" has persisted since the beginning, and we haven't given into it. Why now? I would love more than anything to get breakfast with you on Saturday, and say what we will. I understand your pain, but I think it will be a regret if we don't meet up, or meet up in a bad mood
But ultimately it's up to you.
Also there are things like sitting next to Jennifer and seeing missed calls from Joseph and texts like "I LOVE YOU!!! You're the most amazing person in my life" and shit like that
But I mean I guess it doesn't matter that much
Don't make that influence this!
You're right
That's mostly what it was
I'm sorry for acting this way
I was feeling lonely all day
It's ok, it's an emotional time.
:(
Well now I am done working so I have more time
Jennifer was with me but I mean not really because Joseph and her talked for like an hour
We have a lot of free time at this thing
Do you have a laptop and Internet
calling it training is kinda a joke because we do yoga and eat ice cream
I do, but my roommate and I are watching family guy :/
What's the main event? Has it started?
It's his first time lol
Lol are you gonna finish that at some point?
There is no "main event". It's like a fun retreat
Oh....
Finish what?
We did this poverty simulation I have to tell you about when I see you in person
The family guy
Lol yes that sounds interesting
Lol family guy isn't all that demanding
My roommate doesn't have TV
Where do you want to have breakfast?
Right I wanted to skype tho
Lol wow
Does he have Internet
Mm cafe passé
I wanted to skype too but I would feel bad because he's talking to me about chick flicks
I wanted to skype watch a chick flick lol
He's like "what movies do you like! I like chick flicks" (emphasis on chick flicks)
Can we watch one :(
I have no headphones :(
You want to know my logic?
I was like, "well 1) I'm going to a healthy living conference, and 2) people these days talk to each other and connect, psh, who listens to music anymore!"
Like the progressive youth are rebelling against technology and going to coffee shops to connect again
But I was so wrong
I feel left out
So I have to tell you about my flight and TV and the poverty
:(
This is sad
Alright!
I mean you just watch with him?
But I guess that is it
Out
Cute building
I'm glad you are finally traveling
Though it's sad that you have such limited freedom
Haha well you enjoy your movie bb <3
I just watch with him? What do you mean?
My other roommates got back and they invited me to skip conference dinner and explore the city to get dinner with them 
Aimee the houses in Maryland are fucking gorgeous. The ones nearby our conference are all at least $2 million
They're like all antique politician homes 
 too. At least I have the D.C. city tour tomorrow
Today Jennifer and I got to explore maryland's Chevy chase in the morning and we went to the nicest CVS ever
We walked around for 40+ minutes
Oh I meant with the roomie but it's alrightn
Alright!*
Maryland has the highest median household income
Of any state!
Fun Fact.
Chevy Chase?
Wow 40 minutes!!!! 
$66K
How humid is it
I love how clean my room is now
And if I didn't have work hanging over my head I would feel free :(
I learned that today actually. The Maryland fun fact. If I become more interested in history then I wouldn't mind living here for that and commuting to D.C. 
the more I travel the more I fall in love with American territory
Yeah Chevy chase is the city I'm staying in
I feel like I'm in the Amazon
Ok lol not that humid but I mean you can't walk outside without sweating
I did yoga today and I am relatively unstressed 
I can't believe he's still having you do work the week before you leave
Oh, I thought that was a guy on SNL
Not a place 
Shit it's that bad?!?
I know. I know. 
I want to be done and free
Enjoy my last week in peace
So I'm gonna do it all tomorrow
I hate it
I hate having black clouds of assignments looming over me
Especially when I am expected to do them on my own time
Otherwise I can say, oh well I'll do it when I get in on Monday
You know what he said today?
He told his kids that his family is B-Intolerant, and that if they get anything but an A in college, he will stop paying
And so his kid calls and says there is a class at Harvard that literally one cannot get an A in, and so he says to get the prof to sign and send a letter confirming that no one has ever gotten an A. 
The kid got an A. Both kids ended up with a perfect GPA
Fuck. 
I could not deal with that stress
I'm slowly coming to the realization that I would be perfectly happy becoming a middle of the road doctor
Not one who wants any leadership
Just one who does the time, goes home, enjoys the $
Any ambition of mine works from 9-5 and 9-5 only. 
lol a guy on SNL. How specifically random.
Or you could have gotten it all done today and it would feel like you have more free time
But also I enjoy procrastinating and the prideful feeling of FINALLY being done, you know?
Like wow I finished that and I feel proud of that fact
Anything but an A overall or on certain tests?
He told me one of the kids who worked over the summer killed himself cos of poor performance in college (also underlying reasons)
No I worked all day
No stops
I could not have finished
I mean I know average GPAs are high in college but sometimes bad days (which correlates to bad scores) is a real thing
I could have come home and worked more I guess 
It is a guy on SNL though
A in the course lol
lol are you kidding me. That's ridiculous that he called him
He said he regrets graduating from college 6th in his class cod everyone in his family is Phi Beta Kappa (basically valedictorian)
Yeah exactly I was imagining my own job on my own terms. Not stupid fucking savers where I'm required to work 6 days a week or I'm fired.
Today as I walked by the Maryland homes that's exactly what I thought about
How funny
.......
No he didn't call he prof. He told his son to get the prof to send a letter or deal remains 
That suicide thing is really sad
What did he think of it?
He was very sad
Idk he didn't talk much about it
He said many of the kids he has seen have trouble adjusting
I mean I understand that he wants his kids to succeed but how can he not connect the pressure to that
To his own kids
You want to know something stupid
Don't judge me
What
But I thought that Phi Beta Kappa status was a sort of fraternity award
No
It's an honor society
Like a big big deal
You're totally judging me lol
Tbh I did too tho
Until this morning
Well I didn't think it was a fraternity but I wasn't sure what it was 
"Best Partier" lol
Diviya's college recognition at her graduation
Maybe Charlotte intentionally chose to be in a sorority because it's an ethnographic study and she's planning to fuck them over and graduate valedictorian
Have you ever thought of that?
Pretty clever bitch, hmm?
That's something I would do
A lot of the things I say are things I would do tbh
Maybe she wants to show the world she can drink 5 nights a week and still pull a 3.9
It's funny because Diviya is really not so party-y since like.. Last summer
Everyone's party dead
:(
I'm upset because I need to go to sleep now
😴
🌚🌈🍉🎓🎧✈️
You're not gonna believe this but I've been looking for an emoji this entire time and I can't find one that expresses my feelings lol
🌚🐢🐣🎭🇺🇸😘
My thought process was this:
That's the closest I came
Moon: night time now
Rainbow: surprise! We're gay. 
Watermelon: large black population in D.C. (Sorry)
I think of it as a positive symbol
Though most watermelon eaters I know are white..
Grad cap: I graduated and you are a senior!
Headphones: I have two, you have none. 
Plane: you are away as a result of a plane trip
Yours was so good. I interpreted some of it as relating to Charlotte lol.
How did it relate to her? Do tell
Anyway hahaha goodnight ❤️❤️❤️
Well
Oh ok goodnight!
She's in Alabama
And the music means she parties a lot
And we talked about people graduating lol
Lol funny story
So all summer I'm getting these emails to take this online course to prep for this chemistry placement exam, so that I can pass and get into the higher chemistry class. The higher one is for kids who already took AP Chem and got a 4 or 5.
And the course is long and not very easy
So I gave up, figured I would take the dumb kid class and ace it
So today I go to take the test, expecting to fail
It was like 8th grade Chen
Chem*
Or 7th
12/12
Wtf Brown
And my mom bought me $2500 in stocks :D
I don't know if you ended up reading
But the market had a pretty big correction
AKA drop that doesn't indicate that we are all gonna die
So it's a good time to buy
Hey! How's your day going?
Lol are these tests online?
I hate chemistry classes so much. I see the practicality and it interests me, but a class has never bored me as much
Lol my roommates are talking about how hot country singers are and the country gossip
Roomie 1: I would let Miranda lambert do whatever she wanted to do to me
Rookie 2: imma pray for you
I read it but I don't understand that stuff
That's a lot... Don't you think?
Not really, why?
What don't you understand
Yeah online test
I didn't cheat tho
I like Chem
My day is uneventful
A clockwork orange is fucked up
I am planning the cross country drive
Right now it looks like this:
Night 1: bumfuck, New Mexico
Night 2: Tulsa, Oklahoma
Night 3: St. Louis, Missouri
Night 4: Columbus, Ohio
Night 5: Syracuse, NY
Night 6: Providence, Rhode Island
But we might do an extra day in Ohio or New York
Overall, we will go through the following states:
AZ, NM, TX, OK, KS (maybe), MO, IL, IN, OH, PA, NY, MA, RI
I'm a bit sad we aren't gonna see like Kentucky and Tennessee and Arkansas, but oh well, next time
In fact, we will pass 20 minutes from Amherst and might visit. I'll send pics if so
I hope this doesn't upset you, talking about the travels
No no it doesn't upset me. Why would you say that?
I am happy for you
How did you watch clockwork orange at work lol?
Are you planning on just going to the restaurants or shopping or what in those cities?
Ugh you need to tell me about Syracuse because Syracuse university is on my list
I'm getting my Arkansas and Tennessee and Kentucky fix this week hahaha
I recorded my roommate (with the weakest accent. The kid with the  strongest accent didn't want to speak) for you
No, I'm not at work anymore. Yesterday was the last day lol
I'm still working on the movie, but now I am at the dentist
Idk what we will do in the cities. Eating for sure.
I'll tell you about Syracuse 
What are you doing today
Did you finish all of your work yesterday? I wasn't texting you today because I thought you were working!!!
What did you do today?
Lol wisdom teeth consultation?
No I have more work, I am doing it from home, but it hasn't been worked on yet
Ok thank you!!!
No, filling
In 12 minutes I am going to DC for a tour and free time
? Hello
Hi I just got out of my dentist appointment I was chatting with the doctor now I'm going by bass lesson but what's up
I also just sit for an hour waiting for the dentist to be ready
Apologies in advance for any misspellings I'm using dictation
Also the lack of punctuation
Hey that's ok
Should I show you the pics on Friday or do you want some now?
Send!
I saw both WW I and II memorials, Korean, Vietnam, Lincoln, and Einstein
Also if you ever checked your snapchat LOL
Ok anyway
Why no pics
Did you enjoy?
Oh right 
Whoops
Whoops what?
Are you okay?
I asked "why no pics" when they are in snapchat
Yeah I have just had a crazy day
And my teeth hurt from the fillings
And I'm still going
Like my day isn't over
What's going on now?
Driving to the family friend's house
Well that's not entirely why
It's because I want to see/hear your reactions to pics that aren't on snapchat
You got fillings today?! Did you have cavities?
I got back from the DC tour about 10 min ago and I stopped at the vending machines but I'll tell you about it when I see you
I initially read filling as filing lol
What do you mean?
Yeah I had cavities, but he said they were due to congenital teeth deformities
So when are you coming back tomorrow
That... Is actually pretty offensive. 
And I don't get offended easily
I enjoy watching you look at my pictures lol, idk
Mmmmm ya nasty not brushin all the crooks n nannies
I'm coming back around 8pm. Why??
I know!!! It's disgusting
Khakis can be any color, right? It's only a matter of the material?
 
No it's like actually not that, it was on the top of the tooth
No they have to be khaki, otherwise they are chinos
Y'all look homeless
Rude??
Are you ok
Ya hahaha
I watched 500 days of summer and it wasn't so great
Did you enjoy your trip overall
I think 500 days of summer is kind of similar to us
Or how you view us
But more extreme
Well that's fucking depressing
It's almost one and I'm still hanging out with the gay Puerto Rican kid
He's looking through my Chinese book
What makes you think it's like us?
I said the same thing after I watched it lol
I got sick from Madeleine so that really messed up a long of things
What kind of sick?
Is he cool?
I mean the whole "idk what I want" was like last summer 
And the sex
And then the "I now know what love is" was like Sophia.... 
And fooling around with you aimlessly for so long and then quickly shacking up with her
When did you watch the movie?
Runny nose and congestion
He's very touchy and he's messaging his ex who is jealous that he's talking to me
I'm not even your ex and I'm probably less jealous 
But I trust you though that's why
How bad is it
I watched it tonight with the friend
We departed a few seconds ago
He's like your Rafa but probably more gay and he dances salsa
I feel groggy all day and I had to get medicine lol
And then now we are at the end of the movie where things aren't working and we aren't sure what's going wrong and we think we will find our soul mates
And we hate each other
I'm joking. I think I will come back with a southern accent.
It's kinda second nature now
This is like Church camp--- you'll be over it in a week 
Yeah lol, I know
Probably but for some reason there's an appeal to the southern accent and lifestyle. Like yeah, they fly confederate flags but they be so darn cute!
So you are probably driving or something 
I have to go to bed soon
🌚🌚🌚
🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪
🌚🐢🌺
I'm continuing clockwork orange
And one big motif is the phallus
It is everywhere!
They all wear bulge enhancing belts
And a guy protects himself from a chick hitting him with a dick statue
And there are just paintings of naked women and men everywhere
And graffiti of cocks
Hey
My bulge is enhanced with dress pants, but that's because of my natural penis posture
 I suck black cock
-Jennifer said that
Not me
What exactly is that movie about?
How are you today?
The second or first or both?
It's true though, about the dress pants
I am great!
So the movie is about
This fuck up kid who goes around killing and raping and then gets caught and undergoes weird psych treatment so that he can be released, and then others exploit it for political gain
That's great
Jennifer sent black cock
No literally Jennifer asked me why my bulge is so big
I can't wait to get home!!!
I'm in Dallas now
How did you respond to that
You're so weird 
Ike you you
YOU
What
You're so weird 
How am I weird
I met up with Aodhan today btw
Just because
It must be really tough for her, the whole beard shadow, short hair, bra and skirt thing
At UA
How is Dallas
How was that
Is she passable at all?
Pretty ok, she talked about herself 85% of the time but it was interesting anyway.
No not even a little. She called it androgynous, but it's not there yet.
The intercom voice has a southern twang 
I'm currently drinking a fruit smoothie and I ate pretzel nuggets and fruit 
How are you feeling emotionally 
Like what's going on with you
I want to know
I saw the gender identity therapy. I didn't know there was such thing, but I'm glad she has those resources 
Lol the therapy is usually a joke
It's just a "tell me your narrative and convince me so I'll give you hormones"
Idk I am fine like
It still isn't real to me
What isn't real to you?
I got a call from Carleton regarding my fly in application and the lady left me a voicemail saying she wants to talk to me
But she's going on vacation and I can call back in a week
That could be great!
It just hasn't set in that I'm leaving my life here for the next year in a matter of days
I usually don't realize that kind of thing for myself (camps, etc.) until the last moments before I leave
The lady sounded so interested
Awww I'm gonna miss your tortoise and falling asleep with you and you picking me up after school to see a movie/go eat 
 too :(
I'm gonna miss so much
That's fantastic!
Are you interested in going there
What's up
I missed being able to see you and tell you stories and stuff
I wouldn't mind if I could go there. I hope the "taste of Carleton" (lol) helps me understand more about the campus 
I have to tell you about this Jessica I met on the trip and her suggestions for me 
I'm on my way back now!
Hey I'm at a dinner
Yeah tell me!
Where are you now
I'm homeeeee
How's your dinner
It was good! I will be home in like an hour
I am pooped
Is it good to be home
Haha where are you eating?
I can't wait to see you!!!!
It is. I'm at the Tucson airport
I was at mama Louisa, great Italian place!
Same!!!
When?
Oh yeah I've been there before
When what?
When to meet tomorrow? And where
Tomorrow I work?
Check messenger though for your Friday plans
I thought we were doing something Friday
You also said Saturday breakfast but idk
That's entirely up to you
Right yes Friday night for sure
And early Saturday can work too
Maybe lunch you and I tomorrow?
Yeah, what do you like?
You
I pick?
Hahaha
Lol I get it, I was just avoiding it
You can pick though
Tucson
Do you know what part of town that is
It's right in front of the Lincoln memorial 
Where people stood to hear his speech
Next to the water
Lol I meant the Cuson
Tucson
Oh lol, it was northwest from the airport but I'm not sure where specifically. Maybe part of downtown?
At the Einstein memorial
Did you enjoy all these sites? Really aren't my kind of thing
They're kinda boring because the tour guide doesn't explain or anything, so there's a lack of connection between the person and the memorial
They were fun to pose under
I would much rather explore the city and eat and go to museums and stuff
:( that's fucked up. Tour guides are supposed to explain a lot
Things of that nature
That's unfortunate
I'm excited to hear your stories
I did, however, find the MLK Jr. morial to be the most touching and my favorite
Tomorrow at lunch?
Show a pic of that tomorrow?
Really tired b
What times is your lunch
Yes tomorrow at lunch ❤️
Oh!
I dig that
A Tucson kind of memorial
From 1:00-2:45pm I'm free because my free period is right before my lunch
Great! So I'll come by at 1.
Can you come outs
Out?
the memorials Latinos iron on to t-shirts to commemorate the death of a family member
Yes...........
Of course 😊
Great!
Yes............!!!
Just say yes!!!
Ok lol
I hope you had a great day and I can't wait to see you
🌚🐢🌺
Lol
🌚🐮🍆
You little cochino puto 
You little dickface <3
Jk
🌚🍆🍑✈️🎧🆒🆒🆒
💋🍆🌺👉🏾👨‍👨‍👦
🆗🆒😛
I have free period at 1222
What
12:22?
No 12 lol
So I'm free from 12-2pm
Ok I'll be there at 12
Here
Oh my god
Ok I'll be there in a second
Library right?
Yep
Here
I feel terrible about the cum....
Like I actually can't stop feeling bad about it
It's really no biggie at all
I could feel the joy drain from your face when I asked, I'm so sorry.
It's really fine, no big deal at all. In all likelihood, nothing will happen, and if anything does, it will work out. It's fine, and I had a fantastic time.
Did you get back into school OK?
Lol are you sure you weren't feeling something else drain?
It's alright. I was already happy enough to see you 😘
I did, but in my next class (bio) we weren't doing anything except prepare for a presentation lol
What's up?
I got my check in the mail lol... $226.66
I got $46.80 taken out in taxes
Mady moved out not because her and Conner broke up, but because Mady thinks conner's mom is too controlling 
What's up
Sorry I thought you didn't reply lol
Hahaha
I am shopping. What's up
When do you finish tonight
Get
Hey
I finish at 10ish so you'll probably be home and ready to sleep :(
What're you getting?
Or where'd you go?
Unless you're willing to stay up until like 11
I can be up but what is open
Black crown is always open
I was buying like household crap
Alright, I'll meet you there?
Lol come to savers for all your household necessities!
Went to Ross and Burlington lol
You could've gotten it cheaper here :)
What items did you get?
And older ;)
Lol like
An ironing pad, blanket, quilt, French press
A water bottle
1 pair of shorts 
Lol my coworker wanted me to show Halloween spirit so she threw some nasty cowboy hat on my head and I swear I have lice now
Some flip flops
French press?
Lol
Que es?
Oh yeah so you don't get athletes foot or foot fungus lol
I'm worried about that when I go to college
French press is coffee
French press is a paper weight 
French press is stationery 
French press is stationery with cute frilly borders!
Dis some scurry shit :/
I had my Harvey audition today and I think it was fine. Luka said he loves my acting, which meant a lot.
Coffee lol
Luka looks just like the protagonist in clockwork orange
It's scary
Like exactly
What's your vocal range?
Yeah foot fungus :(
I wanted the neon Nike sandals but 
$$$
This photo has always made me uncomfortable
Idk :( I'm gonna sing my song and see what happens from there
I'll sing a song from Rent
Lol I hope the neon sandals is a joke!!!! Your prep and neon Nike won't fit
*dont 
Yes me too
At the optometrist today I was thinking of that
They were pink and cute :(
Lol you and I can figure out your range
people who think I'm straight: eggs and bacon youre mistaken
people who think I'm gay: ding dong you are wrong
-Sabrina
Hey on second thoughts
I am really tired actually, and I have the hiking at 5:30
Tomorrow. :(
Okay yeah you're right :(
🌚
💖💖💖🌚🌚🌚
It would be great if you brought my book tonight
Ok
What time will work for you tonight
I'm leaving school at 2
Oh so you want to do an afternoon thing?
I'm actually gonna be at the nico's taco shop at 2 if you want to pick me up
I have a court interview
Oh oh
Gosh that sounds intense
I hope it goes well :)
What are you expected to do
Hey sorry
I just woke up
Whoa me too
Where did you take a nap?
Ay bobo
Hey sorry
I just finished the interview
The mouse??
Oh the mouse
I napped at home and I'm sorry I didn't reply in the car, I was a little out of it
What's up? Let's see Compton. 
Park place: 7:45, 9:30 
El Con: 7:00, 9:15
Ok nvm I'll be back
How did things go
7 at El Con is good for me. Drinks before?
Sorry I have been packing
I thought we were gonna do dinner, but okay
Oh ok yes right
Where?
No if you don't want to it's ok
Things went well but the counselor seemed a little uncomfortable
No no I do
I'm sorry, it's a difficult situation. Let's talk about it at dinner?
What do you mean it's a difficult situation?
With the interview
For court
Lol no it's not really. I mean I would like to not be (potentially) charged with physical abuse but....
That's life for the underprivileged
Anyway, do you still like the parish 
Sorry I missed your message notification idk how
Does that seem likely?
That you would be charged at this point
They close at midnight
Yes the parish is wonderful. 
Is there a theater up there?
Sergio I am so so sorry you are going through that BS, especially right now.
There's local music tonight until midnight haha. Bryan Dean is playing!!!!! 🎤🎸🎷
Who dat
There is the Tucson mall theater
But they only show older movies
Yeah I know, thank you 💖
It's actually the last thing I want to be dealing with
I'm wearing formal, FYI
I'll get a ride to el con at 7 to save gas
Shit
I was thinking about formal but all my stuff is packed and wrinkled now... :(
Ok I'll try
Ok we'll figure out the money later. Are we gonna watch the movie and then later the parish, yeah?
Yes
Are you okay? :(
I can just pick you up
I don't care about gas in the least
Yeah! I wasn't replying much because I didn't want to distract you from packing hahaha. Sorry if you thought something else  
Nope, I finished!!
Lol ok I'm gonna be honest 
I'm having my mom take me because my clothes are still in the laundry 
You sure? I can just come by now and wait for you
I can entertain myself 👋🏻🌺
You don't think that's sad
Would you still feel good later
No, I think it maximizes my time with you
Lol I'm not actually gonna do that
When (ish) is the laundry gonna be done though? So I know when to leave
I feel so bad lol but probably 6:45
Maybe 6:40
Lol ok
Look at how big my butt was
 
Or hips rather
10th grade
I think the men's shirts you buy now don't conform as much to the waist so you look fuller, you know?
Are you coming here
On my way now
Yesss
OHHHKAAAAY FHE 
I also am fuller though
What are you wearing tonight
Tell me what you're wearing ;)
Lol I can't imagine you sitting in your car saying this
Here
Really bitch
Yes
Wait like I am actually here
Ok I'm gonna be out in a few
Can you bring a phone charger :)
Origin of disssssss
Nwa dare
Martha hunger cry
Voice
Text me when u sleepy boy
(After brushing my teeth) I am just so happy that we got to see each other today 💖
YOUR BOOK
if you can't do breakfast you could come by and pick it up
Or I could meet you and drop it off
Fuck ok
Yes me too!!!!!
Lol what time are you leaving exactly
I can be up at least two hours before
I'll leave at 8, I can meet you at like 6:30?
We could get drinks
Fuck okay yeah
We can do Starbucks
Great
Ok I'm going to go to sleep then :P
Ok :) 
🌚🐮🐢
🐢🐢🐢
🌚🐸💳😘
(Frog legs & credit card)
Wah wah wah
How's this Gibbs work
Gonna
I'll pick you up?
Do I drive and which Starbucks 
Okay!
Actually
It would save me a lot of time 
If we met at one midway
But if that's not possible, I can come
I could meet you at the one by your house
That would really be fantastic
Still 6:30 then?
Yeah
Ok!
The good thing is it gives us more time at Starbucks
I'll drive over there soon :)
Btw I'm gonna look like a huge mess so
We will match, then.
I left like 1 minute ago but the traffic is great
Told ya
I'm here
I feel like a giant asshole
You'll see why
"I went to Harvard for this"
Hahahahahaha
The script is great. They cut a good amount out of the film
What's up today 
I'm just actually leaving home now... We spent so much time at the family friend's house
Anyway I don't know how long I will have service (probably at least 45 min), so if I don't respond, that's why
I just saw that this section of highway is sponsored by the Raytheon GLBT Alliance, which is just a funny thought to me
Hey
I had the worst dream I just woke up from
Oh you were sleeping I'm so sorry!
I found out You and jay were sleeping together because I went to your house. I was (obviously) very pissed off and you were like "stop acting like a girl. You're being pathetic"
Then I dropped to the floor because your dad was coming and he walks by and sees me on the floor lol
I was awake when you texted me but as I was responding I fell asleep :(
That's so weird. At least all the rich white conservative men who work at Raytheon are slowly dying off and being replaced by educated PoCs and genuinely nice people
Ok :( take lots of pics for me boo boo!
lol did you say good bye to your house
It's funny how I will actually be at your house last, not you
I think my monologue will also be from the rent script book
Are you only headed to New Mexico today?
That's such a sad dream, shit. He sent me a drunk snap about sucking a cock but I missed what he was saying at the start of the snap. 
Clearly not about me, hahaha
I can feel the Raytheon sarcasm from here
Lol didn't really say bye to the house. I did have a moment going into the garage like shit I won't be here for a looooong time
Let me know when you choose a monologue. Though I'm not sure much in RENT would fit as a monologue
Yep! But like Northeast NM
I will take pics! We are driving through like four nature preserves
I wonder why Raytheon would have a GLBT alliance though.
and why would they sponsor a highway lol?!!
Kiss the ground and swim in the pool one last time
When I leave for college I won't be saying bye to much (in terms of the house)
Oh that's pretty far. You should stop at Juarez :P
What conditions were you given for planning your road trip?
That is insane. I'm really jealous. Maybe I'll drive your same route next year
Jk lol
Why Columbus, Ohio?
Gonna go see Anthony hm
Yes lol I saw that on your phone, the patriot stickers
I guess they wanted to show they were good people or some shit
Or just get fame like all gays do by having a sign
Lol I have swam in my pool so few times actually
:(
Hahahaha...... no on the Juarez
Plus we don't have passports on board :P
Well it had to be ~500 mi per day to make good progress 
So that was the big thing
My mom planned most of it tbh
For no good reason at all I have believed for a long time that Ohio is a wonderful and beautiful place. And Columbus is best of its cities (unlike Cleveland and Cincinnati AKA Detroit 2.0)
No, actually Toby. I have been hiding my love for her from you for too long. 
I hope you feel the oozing sarcasm
 
Those stickers you saw were actually on charlotte's snapchat... She took a pic of them
Lol in Chevy chase I saw a church with a sign promoting bible study, but with the rainbow colors in the background
D.C. is primarily liberal and that's one reason they're denied representation 
Go into Juarez once, say bye bye to Brown
They'd strip you dry
Too bad you didn't go into Tennessee :( I told my friends I tried Popeyes for the first time a few weeks ago, and they said the food at Popeyes is NOTHING compared to all the chicken in TN
they said they could throw a rock in any direction and hit a chicken place
*chicken joint
Have you ever realized what people are actually saying when they say "let's blow this joint"
Lol I mean I know how you feel about makeup. How attractive it makes her.
Ohio is where one of the headquarters of my church is and where one of the church colleges is
I left my room to see if I was home alone and I could practice my songs, but my grandpa was reclining in his chair and he said he wanted to talk to me. Okay, that's fine. He told me that in his day not going to church on the sabbath was a mortal sin, and that skipping meant going to hell.
He asked me why I didn't go today and said that I need to place God first (over you and whatever else I did today) because I have been "blessed immensely"
I'll let you know about all the food I try on the way
I hope to get Missouri BBQ
"Think about it" I don't think the people who make that shit have that capability
I never thought of the representation issue that way
That actually makes a lot of sense
Omg popeye's fucking awesome damn that was a good date
 What did we do that day before popeye's??
If you remember 
Ohio I fee is just all over the place, but interesting because it is sort of a crossroads
It touches Kentucky (South), Indiana (Midwest) and the east coast 
Lol so you did get the talk
What I also don't get is that nowhere in the bible or anything else
Is it like "you need to go to church"
Or like anything
Like you could just quietly believe to yourself and go to heaven
Blowing a joint will either:
a) put it out because saliva + fire
b) waste valuable drugs
Depending if you are blowing like a whistle or a cock
Like a whistle or like flo rida's whistle
It's so dumb that I'm just typing Florida with a space
On Death, Sex & Money, I just saw an episode called "Big Freedia bounces back" 
I'm listening to that lol
Did you mention "bounce"?
Something in the south
I was not aware that Missouri BBQ was a famous thing. All I know about Missouri is the St. Louis arch. They have toasted ravioli though! That sounds fucking amazing.
I feel like BBQ is not unique to one state in the south lol
Before Popeyes: we went to the library and looked at your bedding, I gave you presents, bought that feminist book, you saw my buttons, we looked at the college rape quotes project
Then I had to go to work :(
How do you remember this wtf
Anthony never talks about Ohio much, but I think of it as "shit shit shit Kenyon with liberal arts hipster kids and then shit shit shit surrounding it"
Did you look at our old texts
I remember him going to a county fair in Columbus and that was only time he was happy to be there lol
Indiana is the shit. It's all foresty and cloudy
But I like forest
Panorama
Well... In the bible it says that we should try as much to go to our place of worship or be with a congregation, and if we CANT then we have to worship however we can
But fuck that shit
I'm so over it
Doctors and hard work blessed me
Kansas is BBQ
but I figure MO is close enough
I think flo rida is such a stupid name lol. I hate seeing the red dots for incorrect spelling under a word that shouldn't be that way!!!!!
Also as if saying cock wasn't adequate lol. "Flo rida whistle"
Oh I didn't know that was in the bible
The USA blessed you ;)
Big Freedia is something the southern girls recommended to me!!!!!!!!!!
^That's all bounce music
I just remember haha. I had lots of fun that day.
I have never heard of bounce music
I meant to type rolling in the deep bounce version.
They have their own way of getting down to Adele
When I was in 7th grade I listened to Adele a lot because I thought it was super sophisticated
Ooooh where are you now
You can send location!
The houses still look kinda shitty though.
"If I were never born you would still be a fuck up"
YOU blessed me
.. I thought wrong that big Freedia was female
"I'm big Freedia, the queen diva, the dick eata', ya besta' believe her
I'll send location
  
That seems like an unlikely song to remix
Lol it was a rest area
Lol that's for fanning my ego b
Thanks*
How realistic/problematic is Bernie's plan to make public college educations tuition free? 
Big Freedia is a female! I said something as in one thing/artist out of a few other things/artists 
For the Bernie thing: because I mean these are clearly things everyone wants, but how will it be executed?
Oh lol you're not very far. A little past benson.
we never went to Benson pride :(
I heard it and it was actually pretty dope
Big Freedia is a gay boy sergio
Bisbee pride yeah
Maybe next year
NO WAY
I feel so dumb now
I think it is pretty realistic tbh
Like in most states for most students it doesn't cost that much now anyway. Arizona is the exception 
The big question to me is what about out of state student tuition
Lol we only left after 10
LOL
I felt sophisticated by Adele too
The remix wasn't bad but it also wasn't very different at all
They all look 13
Yeah, that is why I'm trying to stay away from any public universities until I get my undergrad.
I know I know, but it also means your parents follow the speed limit lol
I can't believe the Grammys or other music awards used to be such a part of my life. I used to know who won what Grammy how many times.
I also can't stop thinking about if Carly and jay fucked last night
That bothers me a lot
Are you gonna change your name soon? :)
Omg they all do look 13, literally
Because AZ costs $$$?
Lol he actually is 5 under
It saves gas
60 is the ideal speed for MPG
that said, I would pay the $5 or whatever to get there an hour earlier
I feel the same way about the Grammys 
But one day I may feel that way about the oscars I suppose
I really don't think they did
Did she fuck Foxb
Fox?
Yes I need to do that on this trip ugh
How could anyone in the military support that piece of shit
No, because 1) I would not stay in AZ (I've finally come to realize that) and 2) if I did look at public universities they would all be out of state
Lol that's funny. I get where they are coming from but like you said, they're not saving hella bills 
Raad thinks the oscars are not credible or reliable sources for movie critiques
And he also thinks they're an injustice to great low-budget independent films
No, she didnt. At your party she explained it to us; fox said that he "wasn't feeling it anymore" so he broke up with her
"You schooled that radical activist" oh my god
"Where'd you get the guts for that necessary confrontation" 
What is it with republicans getting so turned on by people exercising unjust power 
 This whole "we need a real man to stick up for America" attitude is a disgrace
"That's personal" AKA I don't have a favorite bible verse 
Maybe you should hit up a Trump conference!!!!!
Lol like literally who gives a fuck
Tea party as libertarians but only as long as it doesn't conflict with their morality
Also veterans as 3rd class citizens my fucking ass
You know honestly
Besides how much I hate hearing his voice and the dumb rhetoric
His policy points aren't all that bad like really
I think he also just likes to drive slower
And my mom likes when he drives slow
I would agree with Raad's sentiment, though I do think they are reflective of something. It's like IQ-- I don't think it is the ultimate standard of who is most intelligent, but it does indicate something if you score terribly or fantastically
Jay said that
He said he was in love with another chick
And she thought he might have cheated
Ok but that journalist was not in line with the rules that govern the profession...
As a journalist you just don't act like that
Still, the show did piss me off
I honestly had to pause a couple times to keep it together
If trump did Fordham transfer to UPenn, you can too.
You know, Trump is like a shitty knockoff version of Reagan
Oh shit he called out the silent majority
That is right out of the Nixon/Reagan playbook
Omg
Your mom sounds like Sarah plain
Palin
I just realized
The only policy points I picked up from that interview were support for the middle class and higher taxes on the upper class. It's nothing all that new.
Also he transferred because he wanted to go to the real estate school and he was rich
Kittredge was explaining why some people with 2.0s get into ivy leagues, and he was like "their daddy probably donates $4 million a year and built the school's library"
I'm now in New Mexico but I saw no sign welcoming me
He wanted to simplify tax code
Improve infrastructure 
Reorganize VA
Yeah, I think that if the oscars didn't call those movies to my attention then I wouldn't notice some of them. Also, they really do tend to be some of the best.
Jay's in love with another chick?! What????
That's not fucked up???
......????
Right, they are almost never bad movies
No no
Foc
Fox
Jay said Fox was in love with another chick
That's true. When I saw the video of the journalist it was hard to overlook the brash behavior.
I could barely hear you in the audio recording lol
Yes, however I understand that a lot of policies in these platforms are universal, and ultimately the candidate with the best wins my vote
Lol that's weird since you entered from such a major highway
What do your parents do in the car? What radio stations do they listen to?
Yeah, I think my mom and her have a similar look
Psh image voter
Jk image does matter 
They just talk endlessly
I was saying the $4 million quote as I imagined Kittles would
What words did you come up with for the Carleton word association
Here's mine:
Knowledge - theory
Play - tuba
Future - hover board
Well those views are exclusively his in this race, and I think he's a disgusting person so
That's true, but it's in the patronizing mother way
Or the self-assertive even if I'm wrong way
Kittles!!!!!
That sounds beautiful
You never answered my question about your parents lol
"They just talk endlessly"
They don't listen to radio
Oh I thought you were talking about my mom
about what kinds of things
Idk I just chose whatever I didn't write it down. I thought those were just meant to be silly
Take naps bye
Yo siento mal por mucho hablando conmigo 
Creo que mucho vas a make you annoyed with me
Although I'll break my promise for a sec
It made me so sad when you asked me if you would still be in my circle of people I plan on talking to after high school
Bc I feel like we have gone through so much together that the answer is obvious
I haven't lost you the way I have with some people over the summers and school years
Or lost you at all, for that matter
One thing I fear about moving in with someone is losing the spark you once felt because you see them so often
But I guess if we had work and school and stuff we would constantly miss each other and be excited to come home
I love that my grade refers to you as our favorite senior 💖
In our hearts you are in the same grade as us lol
Don't forget to count the number of confederate flags you see along the way
I wasn't even that sad about you leaving because I had a great morning, but then my mom brought it up and started saying things like "separation heals the heart" and "I know it's tough, here's my separation story..." and making it all sad so I almost cried again
I am not annoyed with you at all! I was having such a good time chatting New Mexico terrain is boring AF
now a bit better 
Wait no, it was a bit better in las cruces, now it sucks again
Anyway I took a nap
Aw I love the favorite senior label
Lol the count stays for now where it started: 0
Mom always has the way of making things so much better ;)
Hopefully you will soon forget what she said and remember how great the morning was
I was being a bit facetious about the after high school thing, don't think that I thought you wouldn't talk to me
Sorry that I don't have more photos yet
We stopped that one time, and then at a gas station in the middle of las cruces
I think the next will be of a lake next to a town called "Truth or Consequences," no joke
I don't get the porn hangover, like do you just get tired?
Or chafed?
Getting tired is there for sure
Rain in the desert
 
Crisscrossing the rio grande
Hey bb 
Lol how far are you into New Mexico now? What's the update
Have you hit Albuquerque yet or are you avoiding it altogether? 
Las cruces? What's with these names?! Lol they all sound inspired by religion
My mom also told me that whenever I want to visit colleges she can send me out to visit you along the way
I would hate to associate myself with a city like Las Cruces 
I get the sick porn hangover where I feel mentally disgusted with myself
That's so pretty because it doesn't look like the droplets are on your window, but stationary in the air and your phone managed to capture the moment
 
"implement that in the church" wtf does that even mean
Happy birthday to Michael
Shit I forgot it was his birthday. I think this might be the first time
I have forgotten
That's so sad
Lol that looks kinda lesbian, it would be hilarious to see grown men do that
I am 35 min from Albuquerque unfortunately
Yeah lol, it's like Catholic as fuck here. Or at least very Catholic in origin
That sounds fantastic! :)
It actually seemed like an OK place? Like not that nice but not bad
I feel that way from time to time, but it's not that severe
Lol I didn't think of the droplets that way!
Panorama #2
Malevolent is the perfect radical feminist man-hating word. It is a negative word with "male" in it
 
Houses next to the university of New Mexico
 
 
 
More angles
Funnily, these houses were found on Amherst street
Don't know if I will have Internet or service where we are headed, so if you don't hear from me, that's what's up
We're out of Albuquerque now.
Lol those were my thoughts exactly. Have the men do it.
Those sculptures and the architecture are crazy!!!!
Malleable because males think they can have women conform to the patriarchy 
That's really insane. I was invited to apply there but idk. It seems trendy but I think it'll get old fast, you know?
They're probably expensive as fuck
How've you been today? Does your booty hurt 
I feel like last night we transcended some sort of feeling 
I can't explain it though
Also I've been wondering why you said that to me last night because it just replays in my head but I feel like it wouldn't be special with an answer
Although I kinda do want one hahaha
Have you interacted with any people yet
Ok I'm going to tell you something really fucking stupid
A couple of weeks ago (this was in front of people too, like Diviya and Keizer) Zayna said that I need to break up with you or she wouldn't be my friend anymore
And I told her no, that if anything we deserve to leave on good terms 
And she was like 'he doesn't deserve good terms'
But anyway, fuck that because it's not her relationship????
Are you staying every night in different hotels?
I was afraid you were going to say that you said you would, and that's why you didn't want her to see me when we went to the rillito
That's manipulative and disgusting
I said it because I felt it was the right time
I feel like that is an answer that is an answer without ruining the mystique
And it was sad too because when Joseph was going to see you during lunch he said "you guys are gonna hate me for this but I'm gonna see Aimee" and that disgusted me
I feel like things go too slow in Albuquerque for you to enjoy
They are $$$ too, for out of state
I have only interacted with a store clerk, to ask for no bag 
I have been feeling kinda sick all day
That actually makes me wanna cry a bit
I feel that he didn't say it because he felt any negative feeling
But it still hurts a lot that he couldn't stand up and unabashedly get lunch with me
Probably best western or Holiday inn most nights
I'm so sad about all this
With Zayna
But I'm glad that you said what you did
I'm holding back tears, and you know how uncommon that is for me.
Honestly it's really pathetic and ironic how she says these things about you being abusive, yet she's attempting intensify hostility between you and everyone else
*to intensify 
I think that the people who know you know the truth
Reyna, Martha, Diviya, etc. and especially me love you and care for you so much
Her words mean nothing to those who love you
And it sure is a lot more people for you
Nobody would treat you differently because of what she says
And it doesn't change my feelings for you
Lol yeah, although I've been considering it and I feel that NYC is too fast for me
I don't know what I'm comfortable with
Hahaha no bag! What did you get?
Also the no bag is supposed to sound like some realization in a movie
It's funny how you had simple interactions; 'no bag'
You can type now
Sorry
Also are you two hours ahead or one?
It's 7:55 here
Ok and the present I was embarrassed to give you was a collection of poems I wrote for you
But I can send you one a night
I was crying for like 5 minutes but I think it's out now
Big Freedia helped me
Thank you
Lol NYC is like the end of the spectrum on the busy side 
I got two fruit punch powerades, and a white chocolate macadamia clif bar (tastes the same as every other clif bar)
Lol I actually said "naw I'm good" when she started to pull out a bag
Nope, it is 9:07 here.
So just one
That sounds wonderful
I feel texting Zayna just a short thing, not a mean thing, just something to express the results of her actions 
But that is probably a bad idea
Don't feel bad about the number of your texts at all, ever. :)
I felt that a lot changed for me last night, which is the longer answer to the why question. I felt certain. I realized how far we had come, how I could tell just through a brief facial expression how you were feeling. I finally felt the gravity of our connection.
I found myself weeping at leaving you; I felt pretty fine about all the rest, not that I don't enjoy their company, it's just different. 
I felt the same way last night
Like it didn't take sex to make anything happen because I felt it all night
I can't easily ask you for coffee or see you whenever I want
I've cried at least 5 times at work today
You have been all I think about
The reason I'm not replying is because my phone is 5% but I promise you I will reply to every last thing before I sleeping 
*sleep
By the sex thing I mean that having sex wasn't what made me realize anything, because all night I felt so connected and in love
Haha I understood. Alright! I'm getting into the hotel now, anyway, so I can't really text. Great timing
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Text me before you go to slee 
Will do for sure
I feel like New Mexico is like AZ with this tradeoff:
1) NM is more liberal
2) NM has even less jobs
3) NM has less diverse and less pretty nature
4) NM is more sparsely populated (for better or worse)
5) NM has more art 
Where u at bb 
I'm still at work ugh
Holy shit boy
I am going to sleep soon :(
I am in Santa Rosa NM
I am hungry
Hahaha
I'm so upset ugh
Well then I'll reply to you while you're asleep at this point
But you're so special to me!!!!!!
Why upset?
That I couldn't talk to you as much
We have no real food here so I am eating fruit all day
I feel bad for
Looking up the song this morning 
Though we talked while I did that, I still feel bad
But seriously don't feel bad about texting, we can text ad infinitum :)
Looking up what song haha
Good night 😘
The one that was on the radio in Bruegger's
Oh hahah that didn't bother me at all. I had fun humming the unfamiliar song, don't worry
Goodnight!! 😘❤️🐢
Thanks Big Freedia 🙏🏾 maybe I should start listening to that. One thing I feel bad for is saying I will start a project (anything-- listening to music, writing a paper) and then forgetting about it
Lol that sounds like the worst dinner ever. I feel for you. Was dad's packed food not good enough haha or did you guys finish it all?
That sounds like a bad idea. She would spread it and nothing would be solved. I would be secure knowing that you have friends who love you no matter what, and that's certain.
Also I'm sorry you're sick! I hope it wasn't from me
Those things you listed about NM are all things I've assumed, and now I have an ethnographer to report back to me. Thanks! But really, none of those things (except maybe with the exception the art or some perks of liberalism) sound appealing. You listed like every reason why sound minded people avoid those areas lol.
For the longest time I've known that I love you. You are my favorite person and the person I trust completely, more than anyone else. I care about your opinion more than anyone else. I feel that I empathize with you on a level that I am incapable of doing with other people. When you told me that last night my throat clenched and I felt like everything in my life was finally secure. I literally can't walk around anywhere or even write this message without my throat tightening and without crying.
It's entirely indescribable 
Whenever quarrels between us would arise I was always certain we could overcome them
You don't know how badly I want to hold you against my chest in bed and stroke your cheek and feel your stubble against my fingers
How much I crave to fill the space underneath your fingernails with mine
I miss you so fucking much already
I can't even remember what it's like to be upset with you in any capacity because my entire heart swells with love for you
Well
Here's the poem for tonight:
I inhale your sweet scent on my fingertips continuously for days
It is a reminder of how I stride down to fill your soul and how you can become a wet rainforest in seconds 
the curve of your back is pounded against car doors and brick walls 
we chuckle at euphemisms and save the intensity for your crucifixion
you extend your hands like jesus as I press them against every metallic and plaster surface
Goodnight 😇
Saw my first anti abortion and bible signs in New Mexico. This town is like a time capsule. It was on Route 66, lots of the business dried up so there are tons of boarded up spots. Also a closed gas station advertising 95 cents a gallon, though I'm not sure if that's from the dip five years ago, or like 20 years ago. 
I feel bad about not completing things that I say I will too
Especially when I start 
Lol the NM list was meant to be a tradeoff- the positives and negative differences
I have felt the same way about the quarrels. 
I know I am not giving a long response to what you said about us, but I don't want to cry in the car right now 
I just got into Texas
I love the photo still
And the poem haha
And the cute duck omg
What's up??
I'm in Adrian TX, at a cafe that flo's cafe from cars was inspired by
Hey!
I was in bed for two hours doing nothing. I woke up at 7am, even though I went to bed around 12:30
Last night it was sad because a barely passable trans woman came into savers to buy jewelry. She looked like a guy with a heavy gay accent and a short brown wig :(
Lol of course you encountered that religiousness on your way to Texas
Those anti-marijuana billboards on the highway lol
Yeah but overall I feel like NM has no redeeming qualities that trump those of Tucson
That's so awesome!!!! Can you take pictures of it?
What kinda stuff is on the menu?
I saw your NM snapchat story of the river. I wasn't aware it was so lush by the highway.
Are you still feeling sick today? Also I thought your dad packed food lol. What happened to that?
I was in and out of sleep from about 6:30 AM, lying to myself that I could peacefully continue
Were you nice to her
Jk I know you were. But did you interact?
No I agree 150%. Literally that river was the first and only pretty place in NM that I saw. Given, I was just along the highway, but still
Not sick today. Yesterday it was like stomachache, headache, general soreness. Not strong at all, but just irritating
Lol he packed snacks
Not whole meals so like
We have bread and tomatoes and grapes and plums and bananas
And tuna
That's all as far as I could tel
Tell
It just was a regular diner on the inside, so all I have is this. Unfortunately I got your message right after we left. I feel that we have now entered the south. They said y'all, and had sweet tea, and "OOOOEEEE"
 
The panorama was out in front of the diner but you can't see the front of the diner in the pic
Bad pic of me
I didn't check out the full menu but
I had pie, chocolate peanut butter and it was good. They had all sorts of weird (but not hipster) types. Like coconut pineapple or Elvis (chocolate, peanut butter, and banana)
Sweet tea was a positive experience
I don't think I had the super saturated stuff. It was sweet but not that sweet 
Awww your mom wears fanny packs
It was funny because I was helping her at the jewelry counter and then my gay coworker told me to leave and that he would take over the counter?? It was really weird. Then they started flirting with each other.
My mom has not stopped talking about you all morning. 
"You said he was Jewish, right?" 
"What did you get him for his goodbye gift?" 
*me blowing my nose* "don't cry it's okay"
"Why did he chose that Ivy League over others?"
After my flight last week I was sore, especially in my core. It felt like I worked out my muscles though. Is that how you felt? Or was it the sore feelin from sitting for too long?
Lol I've never had real sweet tea before, unless you count McDonald's. 
How'd you even find that cafe?! It literally looks like it's in the middle of bumfuck nowhere
Elvis lol
You probably did make it to the south
Be prepared!
Yesterday my manager was like "you'd rather go to DC than work at savers....? Wow. Where is DC? What's Maryland? What's the northeast? Don't you mean the northwest?"
Boy, has the public education system failed some people
Oh my god I really am somewhat of an elitist
Speak of the devil 
Did you know Elvis' favorite snack was toast with peanut butter and banana on it? That's probably why
I read that in some book for boys when I was a kid and eating that made me feel cool
I think my mom found it on tripadvisor but it's the midpoint on Route 66, so that's cool. Like 1339 miles from both LA and Chicago
Lol did boy get her number
I really don't understand the whole "gay guy and mildly passable trans woman" thing
I was about to say that even in early stages I would not have dated a lesbian, but then I remembered. To be fair, she had long hair and said she was bi. 
Seems she is trying to help you out though :)
I felt stomach bad before I got in the car, but the soreness you are talking about was definitely true at the end 
 too! I feel it is a southern rite of passage
I think not knowing cardinal directions is a fair thing to be elitist about
"What's Maryland"
I actually did know the Elvis thing haha, and I did the same thing as a kid
It's funny that the name is "innovative student." Nothing about a high ACT score is innovative?
I actually really like Big Freedia...  I was watching some of her videos; and it was the same thing with black girls wall twerking EVERYWHERE in public
They have a thing here where if you can finish a 4.5 pound steak you get it free
That sounds hellish
I chatted with Elizabeth last night, she was very sad about not having anyone close there to talk to. It was heartbreaking
When I think of Texas I assume closer to L.A., but I looked at the map to see Adrian and it's pretty smack dab in the middle. 
I didn't even know gay and trans together was a thing. Although I'm sure the people you've done things with in the past now identify as more lesbian leaning. Like Sophia. Is it because of the male/tough looking female thing? Isn't that kinda offensive?
I had a dream you changed your name and added a profile picture and we celebrated that occasion lol
The boy did not get her number though. They were literally at the savers jewelry counter for 15 minutes. It's not some huge ass department store.
Stupid question: is sweet tea just sweetened with sugar?
Or is it a certain tea that's sweet on its own 
Lol I know. I score high on the ACT and they expect me to improve the Hubble telescope or something 
Did you just call big freedia her?
If big Freedia is a gay boy what does that say about southern attitudes towards homosexuality
I've been thinking about that
That sounds like asking for a heart attack. That's so disgusting. I imagine plump white men with rosacea and sweat beads rolling down their foreheads as they ravenously tear into the meet and shake their heads side to side.  
When I read that text my heart dropped.
It's depressing how your education restricts you in a way, socially. The people who didn't do as well or who don't have the money stay at the UA and strengthen their friendships. They will most likely stay in Tucson their entire lives and maintain contact with their high school friends.
On the other hand, you, valedictorians, and other rich people from basis are going away. You will see your high school friends maybe 4 times a year during the school year. You will spend a lot of the summer of us. Hopefully we don't bore you (compared to your mind expanding Ivy League friends) and we don't become vague memories
One thing people tend to neglect though is the feeling of leaving. On social media all the students flocking towards their new campus away from home seem liberated. These personal statements from both you and Elizabeth deeply sadden me.
Zayna at 10:31: Sergio what happened with Aimee 
My mom told me I'm lucky to have a phone because when her UA boyfriend moved to Dubai they could only write each other and know they would meet in a matter of months.
The moment you left was the moment I couldn't wait to see you again.
I c u
Reading the article lol
I love our memes
I am really glad to have had a really short haircut so recently. I feel that it has greatly improved my experience in the South. 
You know, I feel like I have lost my grip on capitalization rules. I gave so many fucks as a kid. 
That's a big thing though-- (sane) people share the great moments on fb. You never see their struggles. 
Panorama
Yeah it is pretty offensive, that's the thing. At this point, I would be very hurt if someone was interested in me and their professed identity did not include being attracted to men 
Texas houses are brick and cute
I won't add a profile pic but I will change the name. Maybe tonight
"I love my church" yard signs
Yes it is with sugar, loads of haha
Idk about you but I have been working on the Hubble since age 4... What, you're only working on the international space station, then?
In the podcast Freedia said she doesn't mind which pronouns, but most people use "she," and so the host did. She identifies as male though 
Well, she said she was really really bullied
And that all of her boyfriends up until the current one were closeted ("on the down low")
But her family accepted her so she is out
She got respect over time from being a tough bitch
There was a video of her walking around New Orleans and al these tough looking guys are like "shit man it's Freedia!!!"
I'm assuming you didn't answer her?
Lol first time on the highway I have seen a minimum speed 
"Speed limit 60, Minimum 45)
"
Holy shit months for letters
And the whole naming thing recently is very silly
I'm a traditionalist in that sense, I would have gone with like James and William
I like the recently popular female names
I have been fantasizing about laying with you, outside of just while I am falling asleep
You know, a lot of people in the south haven't had exposure to gay people so they aren't sure who is and isn't. In D.C., a girl from rural Florida said I seemed very straight and she had no idea. She said I wasn't like a guy in her drama class who wanted to get manicures all the time, lol, and of course this guy bothered her. 
Capitalization of minorities as a young child?!
Lol jk. I know what you mean. If it weren't for autocorrect I wouldn't be capitalizing lol. It's too much work.
What a beautiful contrast!!! Did you do that on purpose in your panorama? That's fucking beautiful
It's like man vs. nature
You should submit that somewhere
All that divides them is that sole tree
Then why is it that you would be willing to fuck a straight guy? What if he wants you to put a bag over your head or wear a wig and shave or something
Can you send a pic of a Texas home? Any Trump lawn signs yet?
I can't believe the I love my church lol. Even my grandpa wouldn't do that. Although on Halloween he does put a sign that he doesn't believe in pagan holidays and he says not to come to the door 
At 4 I actually had a social life lol
What's the name of this podcast? I NEED to listen to it.
No I did not answer her and I do not intend on doing so. When they ask me I'm going to say I don't want to talk about it.
Lol that's so funny. Your dad must be upset there's a minimum speed :P
I wonder why they have that though. Too many grandmas fucking over everyone's day.
James and William and Phillip and Charles and Edward are such sexy names to me now
They scream success
Lol you gonna come home for Labor Day? Jk
What holiday do you plan on coming home for?
*holidays
I imagine this bittersweet reunion with intense eye contact, similar to when you came back after that month when you got surgery 
When I was in Maryland I kept wishing you were with me
I can not imagine separation in a time without Internet
Yes those are the EXACT names I like. Edward especially. 
You art-minded fuck. It just happened, but I see what you're talking about. Especially given the science monument
See it's different dating vs fucking
I feel it's legitimate for anyone to experiment 
But if we were dating I would expect him to call himself bi
I would not put a bag over my head or wear a wig, I have more self respect than that
Unless it was like Leonardo dicaprio, lol. Bow down
I didn't take this picture but this is the idea
I wasn't looking hard, but I didn't see any trump signs
It's on Death, Sex, and Money and the episode is "In New Orleans: Big Freedia Bounces Back"
Coming home for winter break and then MAAAAYYYYBE spring (probably not) and then summer. On the upside, my winter break is like December 20- January 27
What did I say to you at winter formal?
It's actually kind of romantic, the idea of maintaining a relationship via letters written with fountain pens under candle light
Do the SUPER femme gays bother you at all?
You are torturing me with these pics
I have jerked in like a day and it's already bottling up
I won't be able to for like probably at least a week
So nice though
Whenever you need help you just ask me and I'll be there
What is the science monument for?
I haven't*
It's for the discovery of helium 
Art-minded fuck was cute and made me laugh lol
It has an atom with two protons and two neutrons
Because Amarillo is like the main helium producer
And also holds the national helium reserve
Yeah, you're right. I was devastated when Shawn said that he liked girls more. Idk, he said he was bi but I felt like it undermined everything.
That house is too cute to be true
I would expect a hospitable Christian family, with a mom who sets tea and crackers for her friends and they all watch nature programs together
They also use the word program to refer to the television shows
That's depressing. I also find that very romantic. I feel incredibly selfish because my ideal situation for us is that we have sexual freedom but we stay emotionally committed to each other, but I feel bad because this is your experience and stuff
I felt that he would go back and forth whenever he wanted to leave someone in order to make it seem like it was out of his control
Because in like 8th grade I was the same way.
It's sad that you told me that the day before you left because like I said, things finally felt very complete
Do you think you could date a bi guy? Does it give you peace that I'm gay?
Lol nature programs? As if. This is Texas.
Super femme gays make me uncomfortable when they're in my presence and (this is going to sound awful) I can't even imagine them being sexy
Like I can not imagine having sex with a guy like that
LOL the 10 story cross I can't even believe that
"Mr. Mayor, what would improve our city?"
I want to think more about the sexual freedom/emotional commitment. I don't know that we could do that without jealousy and issues arising from that. I want to be great friends with you for sure, but I feel like sexual freedom, with our personalities in mind, would conflict with commitment. I assure you though that this isn't like last summer at all, I am trying to figure out what will be most productive and least conducive to hurting one another. Let's keep the dialogue open. 
It is very important to me that we stay close. 
I know! I don't get how those boys get so much sex. Like on one hand they are all dainty and clean, and on the other hand they get fucked in the ass by big men on the regular??
Lol it was actually just a church in the middle of nowhere
"What would improve our church and bring us closer to God?" "How 'bout a real big motherfucking cross"
"To reach up to God"
I really can't imagine sex with a limp-wristed ho either
He pulled the same shit with Reyna where he was like "actually, I like guys more" and we had an ex-convention lol. 
I could date a bi guy again as long as he wasn't an insensitive asshole about it and didn't say shit like that. 
Lol the show would be a redneck shooting cows
Yes! I remember that. That's what I'm talking about 
Mostly because I'm a bottom though, maybe if I topped I could imagine fucking a femme
Reality TV lol
A feeling I developed that I wasn't sure about before is how I feel about sex and other people. Currently, and I think it will be like this for a long time, I really don't feel comfortable and can't even think about having sex with other people. I know that first times are silly sometimes, but it's actually a very personal thing for me.
In a way it wasn't before
If you were to have sex with other people.. Idk. This is difficult to provide solutions forS
I love the idea of resuming things when you come back
It could be a power and dominance thing like with jay, except in the gay community 
Just because they're dainty they get attention
I would hate to hear their super high pitched shrieks
Lol yeah I rarely ever got tired while rubbing you off. That shit gave me energy.
Maybe that's why they have southern accents. It's their punishment for attempting to reach God, like the tower of Babylon
If God was real they wouldn't pull that shit
I can't believe you stayed with me while I was really religious
Even as a top I can't imagine fucking a femme
Omg I'm thinking of Duck Dynasty.
Also just so you know whenever you want to you can always call me and Skype me
What did you think of the fraternity signs
I agree with the idea of getting together when in town. Let's reevaluate our thoughts in a couple weeks when emotions are running as high. 
Aren't*
Wait, where do you draw the line for a femme?
Like is there anyone we know who you would consider a femme
Lol it took me a second to make the rubbing off and limp wrist connection
I know you and your phases. I doesn't faze me
It
I will keep that in mind :)
Lol those signs
Were funny but also pretty objectifying
I am so wet
Actually they were pretty disgusting 
Yesterday at work I was wearing a penguin costume (full body suit) and Amaris walked into the store and saw me and it was all very awkward
It's kind of funny that between us you are a twink top and I'm an otter bottom
What
It's not even September
Do you wear them every day now?
How is he?
Aramis sorry
Mock trial kid
Ohhhhh
Okay, yeah that sounds great. This was based off of one conversation where we talked about the possibility of keeping ourselves single for each other, so we could resume when you came back. While there is nobody here I would even consider that with, I feel like that could change for you.
I imagine femme as a guy with long dyed bangs and super thin lol idk
Nobody we know. Do you?
I'm at work now :(
I'll text you on my breaks and maybe call you, but please send pics and your thoughts
I love hearing from you as much as possible
Ohhhh, see I was thinking of on of the types that wears pink jeans and 10 inch v-necks and goes to pride in a jock strap. Also super thin
In Oklahoma now!
It's actually decently green
I'm pretty sure I have met a few in my day but I can't recall at the moment
I saw one in LA
I don't really understand the full time drag queens who aren't trans
:)
Lol buzzfeed bleeps nigga but not fuck
Oh yeah, that description is accurate as well. Like guys in crop tops and short shorts and heels kinda deal.
I have never accepted the existence of Oklahoma as a state because it's neglected so much
There was that bombing
That's all anyone knows lol
I've seen many downtown. I think of Priscilla characters as femme
Lol one is actually more derogatory and charged than the other 
The ground in OK is red as fuck
What's up now?
What city in Oklahoma
Ooooh pics!!! Like red dirt?
Also we went to a restaurant that was recommended and it was in this nasty ass hotel
But the food was decent and cheap
Lots of scary looking creepy ass obese and old truckers 
When I can get one!
You know every time I text you from work I am hiding in the bathroom
It is seriously very very red dirt
There's literally nothing for me to do and they acknowledge it
Elk city OK
I'll believe it when I see it lol
OK YES that is what I think of as femme. The Priscilla types. They don't have to be wearing women's clothes constantly, just have the strong accent and act all loud
Hahaha I figured you had break or were allowed to if you weren't doing shit
The idea of being at work and being expected not to go on your phone despite having nothing to do bothers me
Not managing to take a good pic so I found a representative one through google images:
Hey bae
What's up with you?
Lol who recommended that? What did you guys eat there? I don't even consider motel restaurants real restaurants 
Acting all loud and flamboyant is KEY
They have their phrases they overuse and scream whenever they get a chance 
lol it turns out so many other people here want to quit too. I'm gonna write my resignation letter tonight and bring it in after school.
I hate all of these "rules" and regulations. It literally doesn't give the company a bad name. If i saw some employee on their phone I wouldn't care. It's business. It's normal. It's probably important, and if it's not then who gives a fuck.
Today an employee ran out yelling on the phone, "THEY FIRED ME BECAUSE THEY SAID I DIDNT FIT"
He's this fat white trash guy who came to savers after quitting McDonald's 
That looks like something you could just lie in
That dirt
I'm more stable today but I feel nauseous because I haven't eaten anything and I'm running all over the place
There's also red dirt in the Grand Canyon
Captured by yours truly 💋
Maybe in lieu of writing letters under a candle light I can wait a week and a half before replying to your texts hahahah
It's going to be strange not texting you every day.
Or even talking,
Have you driven at all during the trip?
More than a woman is playing on the savers speakers
 
Congress's two Native American members are republicans from Oklahoma
"Native Americans"
Well I took a nap
And woke up in Oklahoma City
And it feels like Marana. The city just looks republican
Literally every county in Oklahoma has voted republican for the last three presidential elections 
It was recommended by the lady at the Oklahoma welcome center at a rest stop lol
Also yelp
Lol you are gonna write a letter?
Who else wants to quit?
So have you decided to try to find another job?
That's not a classy thing to do Mr. white trash mcdonald
It's weirder here because it's mostly all grassy, but then in the cleared areas for farms it's like BAM
Christmas colors
What kind of music do they normally play there
I have not driven an inch
My dad would NEVER let me drive his car hell no
Crazy Freedia twerking as well as hilarious white people 
Hey
Again lol
lol they're only successful because they got the affirmative action to get into a good college and then identified as white after they were admitted
That's how sneaky the politicians be
Ew so you mean like communities that all look the same
Oklahoma welcome center lol. I have two stories to tell you about work
But should I call you later or tell you about them now?
We could skype this week
You have to write a letter if you want to leave in good standing. It's lame as fuck.
I probably won't find another job until February when I actually have time. I already have ~$400+ from savers which is great for me
Christmas colors? Like green and red? Sometimes I consider white and blue icy Christmas colors
They play everything. Country, Motown, oldies, etc. it's like they switch stations every song
I'm sorry but would you mind telling me the names of the videos because YouTube is being a dumb bitch
You're almost already halfway across the U.S.!! That's crazy
my lunch ends in 17 min btw
Ok I'll tell you the stories
I'll be out of the car in about an hour
So I can call then
How long is your lunch???
30 motherfucking minutes
Lol one went to community college
Didn't check where the other went
That's how long it takes me to get across the store
LOL the other one went to Grinnell and became a republican (and then went to graduate school at Yale)
And finally got a Ph.D. In British History at U of Oklahoma
Yes and families with young kids and pregnant bellies. And bass pro shops. And shit head kids smoking and driving motorcycles loudly and spitting
I wasn't aware that most savers workers were capable of composing letters
Lol yes red and green. Though I agree that they aren't all that associated these days
Not gonna spend as much $ with us not constantly going out
Yep, almost! But not halfway through the trip-- it's gonna be six days and this is only day 2.
The videos are called
big Freedia breaks Guinness world record twerk
And
Big Freedia performs "excuse" before setting Guinness world record twerk
Omg I love the white people in the crowd shaking nothing
RIGT
RIGHT
Lol who called it!!! Who called it?! I did.
I knew at least one of those suckers went to some Ivy League 
and that hipster white bitch towards the end
Although shame on the Ph.D. at U OK because I feel like his area of study wasn't the strongest at U OK
also it's weird typing U OK
Lol Oklahoma sounds just like a savers store!
Working here is so different. My memories of us coming after Joseph's party to shop together are not tainted with shitty managers and customers
*are now tainted
My back and legs ache because I'm standing up all day
I like spending money with you :(
Found this gem in the store
Has anyone gotten annoyed yet on this trip?
Whenever I go on road trips someone cries or gets really upset or throws up or gets a nosebleed lol
Is driving to campus a tradition for people who live far away or what?
Is it a thing not exclusive to class?
Have you cried today
I've been pretty okay. Only two/three times.
I get so stupid
What're you gonna do when you get off?
Sorry I was getting into the hotel
I will moan when I get off
I would hate doing a job that requires standing so much
Do you wear good shoes?
Mm some short annoyances but nothing that didn't resolve within a minute, so not really
Which is surprising because I usually end up super pissed at some point
Lol the basis shirt 
We heard it was a tradition 
But I don't know anything about it 
I welled up a bit but no other than that. I don't really have any alone time so it would be very inconvenient
Do you cry at work?
What happens if you cry at work
That's alright! Is it actually a hotel or are you staying somewhere shady? Which city are you in tonight? Did you reach Tulsa?
I wear my converse lol, so not really
I can cry at work because I'm alone most of the time. I have welled up in front of customers while at the register and I've cried during my breaks or lunch, but I'm always alone
I cried in the bathroom once
I feel like the people here wouldn't really care because we all "go through our own shit"
How much decor did you pack for your dorm
Do Elizabeth and jay still talk often?
Also you're so lucky you don't have to do work study. Could you potentially work in a lab or something?
We did reach Tulsa!
It's a best western again. My dad prefers it because he is close to getting gold member status or something that gives him free upgrades
So he wants more points
Otherwise we would probably be at a Sheraton or holiday inn
So it's not shady, but also not particularly nice
By alone you mean the only one in that part of the store?
I brought your poster and my Klimt poster and a pillow with your pillow case
And then like I have a like oaxacan tortoise figurine
And a small brass pitcher to hold pencils
Just a few small trinkets
I think they do still talk quite a bit
Yeah I could do that if I wanted, but I probably won't this semester. I'm trying to ease in
Jay said he told her he was going to stop calling her babe, and that she was welcome and encouraged to sleep around, though he won't for a while
It was so nasty because last night I was crying into my burrito
B I am so sorry I am going to sleep
🌚
Tired AF
Feel free to send any and everything though
No that's alright I'm still gonna text you haha
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Have a great night and I'm glad you're safe so far!! 🐢
Good night my love
Gold member sounds pretty legit. Maybe they're gonna claim a free room on their way back or something. Hopefully your hotel has good food and breakfast so you don't have to suffer through shit hahah. 
I'm glad you made it to Tulsa! You should read about the race riots, they're awful. I wrote a paper on them for seminar last year. 
By alone I mean in the part of a store or facing away from other people when I'm not. I couldn't even drive home. I had to pull over because I kept crying.
I hope it doesn't sound too pathetic but the realizations are too painful :/
After seeing your bedding I'm a little worried as to how all of these colors/patterns are going to come together
I guess inconsistency is the latest, hm?
That's probably best. I've realized working crazy hours isn't ideal for me during school.
I know for a fact that you'd hate it hahah
YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN THAT SNAP OH MU GOD
I forgot what an angel you are
Did you know Wes Craven died? :( what a tragedy, losing geniuses
Anyway I'll talk to you tomorrow and I look forward to hearing about everything 🌚 I love you
I will tag you in some Instagram stuff
Here's from after a hike:
we promised to not see a snake and it once jinxed a nature walk
but when the same two people tacitly find love how will the jinxes play out?
Also I listened to the Big Freedia podcast and my initial thoughts were: I can't believe Jesus inspired bounce music lol
Lol saskia posts a bunch of videos of her and Shawn and Gil and the bunch of seniors living together, and all they do is drink and smoke weed and play video games and do homework
Race riots in Tulsa?
It doesn't sound pathetic at all
Lol so
My sheets are blue and white small stripes, and I have a pillow that is that same pattern 
And then I have like a navy blue pillow
But it is the latest
I'm a visionary
Yes! I saw about him. Did you hear about Mt. McKinley being renamed Denali by Obama? And that John Boehner called it a disgrace
Because Ohioans had named in McKinley because he was a presidential nominee at the time from Ohio, and Boehner represents Ohio
I saw the Instagram stuff! It was so good
Loving the tortoise
And sylvester's bulge
And Miley's rainbow cumshot
Also I made hundreds on the stocks this week
I'm glad they do homework
And a bit surprised
I hope it doesn't play out like the kids last year who dropped out
Will listen to the Ted in a bit
Your emoji drawing was brilliant 
How big are the brown dorms?
I heard about it being renamed but what's the controversy? Is it discrediting the discoverer? 
I didn't look into it much
The news my family puts on in the morning only talks about who's climbing what mountain and which lady left her child in a shopping cart and the new dog the Johnston family adopted
What makes me upset is that if my mom was knowledgable about the stock market then I, too, could be making hundreds off of it
Oh I saw the explanation of the mountain renaming after I sent 
Lol I think Gil would be the only one to stay in school
Have a great day!!
Send some pics, stretch your muscles, penetrate yourself with a cucumber 😘
Also send me your stock advice and experience because I may put $200 of my paycheck to that
lissa's parents live off of stocks lol
I had never heard if that! That's really awful. 
Mine is 269 square feet which is considered pretty big, though on my floor it's one of the smallest. 
Most are decent sized, I think.
Tufts one was tiny
The one at brown I stayed in was damn big
The brown dorm I'm in, for comparison, is slightly smaller than my current room, but the 269 includes the closets
No it's discrediting President McKinley, and Boehner is mad cos:
1) McKinley is a Republican
2) McKinley is from Ohio
3) everything Obama does must become a controversy
4) McKinley was assassinated
My parents' morning news is all Donald trump
I read it in USA today
Whoops about the Boehner explanation 2.0
Tulsa is actually like really nice
Lol and hopefully Shawn
Might send some pics, probably sans cucumber
Lol my advice is have fun you are young 
All these churches and old skyscrapers
 
Not flattering photos
Lots of infrastructure and old shit
 
 
hey
It’s funny that you said I’m young because we are literally the same age. 
Well yeah but like
That's all your money
My mom can invest for me and I still have spending money
But I see the humor
 
Found at "Kum and Go" and QuikTrip competitor/clone
Made it into Joplin, MO, home of hella flooding
I meant hella tornado, whoops
Saw my first confederate flag!!
Wentworth, MO!
ewww those ghetto ‘purses’ (if I can even call them that) on the rack under the crosses
what a disgrace to fashion!
Those are literally the purses that white trash girls here have
Is Kum and Go actually a thing???
that sounds highly suggestive. 
Don’t get any ideas, please ❤️ 
That’s not you speaking, is it???
Where did you hear that lol
HOW IS MISSOURI?????
^^thanks to Keagan
I did that actually. I did that accent
It's really pretty actually
But the people are hickish as FUCK
Also, I was serious about the stocks thing, because I think it would be a valuable investment. 
We are in the most rural areas tho
I want to make hella moneys $$$
We can Skype one day and I'll talk you through sticks
stocks
Kum and go is for real
What great insight from keagan
 
Very pretty forests
And so many churches
So many
And trashy ass clothes and obese people and meth addicts and trailers 
But also pretty houses
Haven't seen any pretty people in a long time
Wow I sent you a picture in the morning fuck yo 
What
Haven't seen any pretty people
Haha I meant in person
HIV prevalence among black men who have sex with men approaches 50%
And 60% of those are unaware they are infected
Despite the fact that there are way more whites, there are slightly more blacks gay infected every year than white gays
But it's just because at this point it is ingrained in the community
Same rate of testing, rate of condom use, less sex partners
Do the tumblr SJWs like Miley?
Zayna showed me pictures of her grandfather meeting with the president of Hamas 
Fuck, your dorm is pretty big then because I assume the closets aren't that big.
All those churches and 'skyscrapers' make me uncomfortable. They seem out of place in the city.
What defines hickish lol
Those forests are rather pretty though. Thank you for that.
Yeah, when I read the HIV thing I assumed it was a result of the lack of education and condom use among the population
Oh, with the same rate
I keep reading your messages after I send things and then I sound stupid lol
Well then that's just really sad :( how terrible
It's weird because there's a divide in tumblr for Miley support. With the recent Nicki Minaj scandal her support is kinda low, and people assume Miley is just an attention seeker. She released a new album yesterday and it was... interesting
As I was typing this the radio just held a poll for Miley vs. Nicki LOL
how was your day today? Any interesting stories?
Why do you only put nature/places snapchats on your story lol
Kanye west announced he is running for president
They gay boy at work actually has vitiligo.
Is she proud of that?
Did she ask you again about what she said?
Yes the closets are not large
Some dorms are up to like 350...
Hickish is like, I'm afraid of them pulling a gun if I go on their property
My day was pretty cool, nothing particularly interesting. 
I feel that those are the things most interesting to widely share
Is it obvious, his vitiligo?
The sad thing is that I would almost vote for him given the shitty field
My grandpa on the mountain name change: "who and what is Denali!!!! I went to McKinley elementary school. this is such a wretched world. I feel bad for the kids growing up."
I gave her a suspicious look and she didn't even look up at me and continued scrolling through her pictures 
She did and I said that it's not what she wants to hear and it's inappropriate for her to ask me, and then she said "Well I hope for your sake that you did the right thing for yourself"
Oh lol well yes, that is pretty hickish
because he's xican and lighter than me it's not too opposing, but it is kinda obvious 
Anyway I had a kinda shitty day and I feel like so many things are falling apart but it's okay
I'm pretty sure if a republican made the name change he wouldn't give a fuck
I feel like an idiot in game theory, I miss you terribly, I got rejected from Amherst fly in and they replied with a shitty letter compared to Nathaniel's, I don't want to audition for the musical because I can't even sing, I want to quit my life-consuming job.
Amherst didn't even offer me an application fee waiver
They did for Nathaniel though
I feel like so many things are weighing me down and I feel like especially now my life is unfair
I don't even know what to do, but I will start with quitting the job
I feel like major shit right now
To be fair you did the right thing for yourself, as she said
They didn't send you and Nate the same letter?
Sergio I'm so sorry :(
It sounds like an awful
Day
Did you call Carleton?
I am actually so devastated that I can't call you so we can get coffee or something
Like you have no idea
Did something happen in drama? 
:(
I'll be at the hotel in like an hour
And you're enjoying your road trip and seeing the world and I'm trapped here
You know, you just need to get through this year. You knew it was gonna be a hard path, an uphill battle. You can't base your self-worth on these decisions that are based on who you were years ago
They are rejecting freshman you, not current you
It will work out, you just need to keep your head up! We both knew Amherst was a long shot, but next year it won't be a long shot as a transfer!!
That I'm here and you're there is, luckily for you, just a matter of time, that I skipped a grade a decade ago. You are gonna get out of Tucson and explore the world, it's just a matter of time
And in the meantime, you have cool people, cool places. You know what's up in Tucson, you can grab midnight coffee and art house movies.
They rejected both of us but Nathaniel got a letter that said "you have demonstrated strong academic success over your four years, we would love to consider your application later. Here's a fee waiver" and mine was "If you believe that Amherst is a good match for you, we would love to review your application for admission in the fall."
I'm supposed to call Carleton tomorrow
Nothing happened in drama but I am not very confident in my abilities
Thank you, I'm sorry for being like this this week. It's been difficult.
I honestly feel like I am draining a lot of your energy by saying all of this negative sad stuff
Ughhhhhh
Anyway, how are you doing
What's the latest with your trip now? Where are you staying tonight and what sights and restaurants did you stop at?
are your parents peeved at anything yet?
Good luck with your call, let me know how it goes as soon as you get off the line
You at least had the courage to audition! I know I never did, despite wanting to. And I'm sure that's not true. Plus anyway, you have just started, you aren't expected to be the best right away. Enjoy the path 
You aren't, I am glad to hear you out and support you 
We are staying in Northwest St. Louis in some suburb, at a Holiday Inn, which I'm happy about. It's better than Best Western. At first I suggested a Westin or an Omni Hotel, but my dad wanted a place with complimentary breakfast. 
We drove through
Mark Twain National Forest and it was fucking beautiful
But it was homogenous 
Really you can see it all within a few minutes
Today... I went to Walmart lol
Didn't eat out 
🌺
This was in a nicer neighborhood in Tulsa
They often don't have fences around the houses
And even just OK neighborhoods have small lies
We visited university of Tulsa but
There wasn't much to see
The building were mostly uninspired 
My dad got angry at the long detour but he got over it, he just likes to be "nudnik" as we say in Hebrew. Don't know what the translation is really, but it's kind of like "annoyingly combative" but in a light and silly way
What are you doing tonight
In the coming days I plan on
Trying burgers at a White Castle and Steak n Shake
I didn't even know Westin was an international hotel chain!!! I really have not been anywhere lol
I didn't either
I just saw it on hotels.com
That sounds so beautiful, the Mark Twain forest. You can actually drive through it or did you pass it?? You took pics, right?
Lol I saw your cucumber snap at Walmart. Are those walmarts trashy too like ours?
That 'nicer' neighborhood seems like it would be unsafe at night, idk. Life in those areas seems so fucking unappealing.
Even the universities. It's like the further east and south you go the less people care about aesthetic 
Minus the few big cities
I can understand the feeling lol but I can't think of a word to describe that combativeness  
I tried White Castle in Indiana and I remember getting frustrated because I was still hungry 
Tonight I am doing my homework lol and I am also going to a scout meeting for a few minutes to drop something off
What about you? Did you 🌺 today?
I would love to skype you but I don't want you feeling uncomfortable with your parents around
Small lakes*
It was supposed to say small lakes
There were no shoulders so we couldn't stop
So I took some video
Which isn't that great, but I'll send once I get to wifi
Their walmarts are not trashy compared to what surrounds it. They seem comparatively nicer. And I think they might actually be nicer, because it's not just the shitty people that go to Walmart
It was actually pretty close to the interior of the city, and looked damn safe. Bad photo.
Also houses there are affordable AF
I disagree!
I think the South and the old shit there is incredibly aesthetic 
Given, the new construction often sucks. The houses are cute, but lots of buildings are just metal warehouses, especially churches
I won't argue that life in the South seems unappealing 
I like St. Louis though
It seems really cool
When are you finishing scouts? What homework?
I have not touched myself in the slightest
I could skype you from the lobby tonight
All the rural people I saw were ugly
Just like fundamentally unattractive 
Some looked inbred 
Oh lol, well small lakes are nice, yes. It all looks very quaint. 
Riiiiighhhhtt. Walmart is a huge deal over there. My southern friends had never stepped foot in a Safeway. They only knew Walmart and Kroger.
This photo bothers me. Everything is uneven and looks like each building belongs in its own section. I can't possibly imagine all of that coming together to one city.
I was imagining Skype sex too but lobby is okay.
Lol that's so sad. What does ugly mean in southern standards? Teeth and nose?
I wonder when it will start to get more attractive.
I think it's a cool trait to consume hot foods
Like if someone can't take any heat they might be lame
I think the panorama changes the proportions and makes it look more uneven than it is. That said, it's an awkward place that is just a bit out of downtown 
That maybe could happen in the bathtub?
I'll take a bath, run the water, we can chat while it runs?
Over FaceTime
Idk like
So many fat and disproportionate and just like gross faces
And dirty
Ok! Let me know when, preferably in 40 minutes-ish
And no makeup
Or bad makeup
But especially some have like fucked up jaws
But also teeth
Let me know when you can do it
How do you feel sexually right now
How late will you be up tonight?
Because I'm home now
Sorry I missed your message!!
Idk I can stay up till whenever
Within reason
Won't stay up for more than like another hour and a half
Can we talk on the phone first and then do that? Is that a plan?
Yes, I'll call in a few min
Ok :)
Give me a heads up before
K I'm gonna call
A real craigslist post I saw 
These can be so funny
This is so specific it's difficult to understand
Like I know what each letter means individually but not together
My brain hurts
PLEASE NO CIS MEN
But ftm is ok? That's kinda bitchy
To be fair she seems ok with trans women
It just seems like she doesn't want straight boys, which is more fair by far than saying Cis women and trans men
"Someone on the alternative side" lol
Someone willing to get their feet wet
Speaking of getting wet
What's up with you?
Heading to the shower now
I'm gonna be relatively quiet in speaking btw
Ok and also while we recognize that maintaining intimacy is difficult with distance
Do you still feel attracted to me emotionally and stuff?
Or like are you speaking from the standpoint where you have witnessed feelings decimate through distance?
Sergio yes!!!
Because that's where I was coming from
Lol yeah I'm gonna be quiet too
I don't think I will be able to maintain what I felt that night, or how we felt then, together
But I will not stop caring for you
Or about you
Everything about that night was soooo perfect
I will always long to come home and see you, and hang out with you
From the way you moaned your feelings to me to having my arm around you during the movie
Like it all replays so beautifully in my head
:)
I won't be speaking because it's too loud
But I can look at you lol
Ok same
Can't lip read
Almost at all
Oh lol I said gracias and I love you and that was great
And you are sexy
You too okg
Omg
Lovin that
That was so much fun
I agree
I hate that I'm in the bath though cos it's hard for me to jerk off
Did you jerk though? :(
Oh yeah I was wondering about that
I did yeah but it's more difficult
But seriously you looked so good
And sweet
When you pulled the skin back that was soooo hot
I miss doing that
Lol your examinations
I hope you enjoyed the dick smack on your face simulation
That's what I was attempting to do
Wish u could be smacking for real
Ugh and when you stroked your butt
Also liked the dick up and down
That was glorious
Hahaha my party trick
Lol and your fingers telling me to uncross
Lol ok so that was obvious
I wasn't sure if you understood or not until you finally did it
You might've thought I wanted you to do leg exercises lol
Or I was suggesting scissor unt
Scissoring 
Or making promises lol
Lol
Do you wish we had more intimacy during sex or did you enjoy the roughness?
I wish it lasted longer or we moved to the back and you got to lie down
I wish we had a bed
I think about if we had a room to ourselves
To watch movies
And read
And cook
And eat
And then playful gestures turn into more
And we go to this bed, like the bed in Annie hall
And you take me any time day or night
But especially day with light coming in the window and a light breeze
Or do you mean the last time
I imagined living together and while you were working I come into your office/workspace and start massaging your shoulders and then one thing leads to another
Because the last time, I wish we had a bed too, lol
Or if we had a pool we could have done the pool sex
And I thought it was over quickly
Honestly
Yes, I was talking about the last time and how it ended too fast
I feel that in the car, going multiple times is not as enjoyable for me, because it's a long time to be in an increasingly sweaty car, pounded against a door
I love the first time, but the considerations of reality set in on the second
Yes omg pool sex
I remember we were swimming with Reyna and like
I feel terrible every time we have car sex because I am literally dripping sweat onto you
We weren't fucking but I could feel your cock on me
Hard
Lol we were at the beginning stages when she left to get a towel
Omg yes the office sounds hot 
And we could've taken early morning hikes or neighborhood walks together
Maybe when you come back for the summer we can rent a little apartment for a month
Or do something spontaneous 
That would be fun!
I hope I don't end up with full summer commitments again
Lol and the times she went to the bathroom and I blew you
That was such a thrill
And even if you do there are always places in Tucson we can stay. But yeah, if you don't then we should definitely plan something. I'll be working from February-when I leave for college
To just rip off your pants and start unexpectedly sucking cock 
That's gonna be lots of money
Somehow you got hard within like 5 seconds
Lol I know it was like a challenge for you each time. I feel like you must've been so flattered that it happened that quick 
I meant like spontaneity, to go on a long trip say, might be hard 
Or when it grew in your mouth
Hahahahaah
Candles and bathtubs :(
Went down on soft dick, when I came up it just came up with me
Yes!!!
Even if we got a cabin on mt Lemmon for a weekend 
That would be cool
And you said that being high amplified all feeling for you whenever I stroked your arms 
Although I feel numb all over whenever I'm high
Omg or fucking behind that tree on the mountain
That's so sad
YES!!! They're $25 a night at Lawton
For me it makes sex sooooo good
Like each touch is just like wow
We should do that for winter break 
And each thrust is like being pounded into god's arms
We can give each other presents up the mountain
That would actually be really fun
Wait but like
Is there anything in the cabins?
The gay problem?
I would want to stay for like 3 days
And like bring some books
Lol being pounded into god's arms actually sounds like a nightmare. Jesus is where it's at.
And we would watch movies, and fuck, and read, and fuck, and hike, and fuck, and fuck, and fuck
There are four bunk beds and a heater
And a huge desk
Lol bunk beds
And then there are showers and bathrooms (each individual rooms) up the hill 
They're pretty nice
Look at this:
I was so flattered 
I am so flattered each time I see your cock hard actually
Like "I did that???"
This is a picture from the cabin patio
We could bring our laptops and store as many movies as our hard drives will allow
I really feel like you changed me so much, I thought no one would think I was sexy, always second class
When you faced the camera towards your 🌺 I got super super hard, idk if you noticed 
Hahaha our hard drives allow far more than one could watch in a weekend
Like every time you crossed and uncrossed 
How big are they?
It's hard to tell without touching :(
I miss your cock in my hand actually 
Honestly Aimee you are incredibly sexy. Like I've wanted to fuck you since prom 2014
And those feelings intensified over the years
You actually are the most attractive and beautiful boy in my eyes
I know I know, but an unreasonable fear of mine is running out of space on my laptop lol
I'm afraid to download things because I don't want my computer to crash and then I lose everything 
My family is so cheap and gets the minimal space Apple products 
"Back it up" isn't just a phrase used on the dance floor
I have 8 GB and room for like 2 pictures
I ran out of space on my phone today :(
Aww
I remember before and after prom 2014, but don't remember the prom itself
The cabins are actually big, especially for us. 
Where was it?
The place that we had prom at this year?
In the cabin lol
I came late and left early
I miss you too. I want to touch your butt :(
Lol that pic
Lol seriously? Yours is 16, no?
Just put your hand in some warm cottage cheese!
Yeah but I've been building shit up since like 2010
Prom was at Sheraton next to ihop. I remember you drove me there and we listened to Pu$$y and I was incredibly jealous of you and Martha
Tons of pics and vids
Ohhhh
Yes I remember now
You guys left the dance floor to go sit on the couches and I spied on you lol
All the dances names blend together
I remember billings commenting
You spied on us?
Cottage cheese will do the trick. And what shall you do? Put a cucumber in the microwave?
Lol I remember zellmer see me twerking
Ok spy is the wrong word
I remember you wore gold
I saw you guys sitting on the couch when I was getting pictures taken and I was upset 
And it actually looked so good
It fit you well
Yes lol
She sat on my lap or leg or whatever
I have a picture of you from prom on my old iPhone. I should recover those pics because they're so good!
I have to say boy, before I saw your game, I thought I had mad game
Yes lol!!!
Lol yas
My game?
Like fashion?
I hope that's a joke
No haha
"Those checkered pants are hideous@
The random xican gay boys
Hahahahaha
You know what
I don't get
Is there a thing
Like xican gays like other xican gays, and blacks and white the same
Also you need to explain the gay xican thing por favor
Oskar is that way
The random gay xican boys
Big Freedia is that way
Like you get random creepy boys flirting with you almost wherever you go
You mean to say that I find xican gays more attractive ?
No no
xican gays go after you
I actually get hit on a lot
Like it's almost always a xican gay
that's what I'm saying
But I feel uncomfortable about it so idk
A part of me fantasizes about cat calling and finds it hot
But because I care for you so much and stuff it makes me deeply uncomfortable
About you cat calling???
Or others cat calling you
Lol no, receiving it
I would never do that
No no, it's the ultimate form of flattery for a guy
I totally understand
What's the demographic of people who hit on you?
Women
There was Terrence 
Lol
That black guy
Oh him too
And Doug
YES!!!!!
You and women, damn
There was Martha, the MUN girl, Bella Ruhl
You look like a sweet guy 
The girl at my first high school dance
You come off as very personable and it makes you approachable 
MUN girl? I already forgot her lol
Lol too bad I'm a dick
You connect well with the female population 
I think it's cos I'm like nice and not pushy cos I'm gay
But also not that gay-acting
Lol yeah I remember that also made me jealous
Which MUN was MUN girl at
Hohhot
Girls get turned off by the gay acting thing but turned on by sensitive boy
Ohhhh
I remember the girl now
Yes
So I totally understand the attitude 
"Can I suck your dick" lol
That girl
Oh that girl too
Shit I forgot that girl
I meant another girl
There were multiple????
W H A T
Yeah that conference there was another girl
Actually 
I am coming to realize that
I'm so glad I don't have this problem
We have about the same amount of game
Well you would never fuck a chick
But mine gets directed towards girls, unfortunately
So there's that
Right
My game is all in the right place lol
Yours is a little out of whack
But that's alright :)
What does this mean for the future of society
We gon bang
We need to help gays recognize their power in this world
I guess it means we need to bang each other
Everything goes back to monogamy 
Idek what I'm saying at this point lol
Oh I also got Tufts boy lol
Ok that was probably self esteem issues
That makes me uncomfortable
Is that U.S.
Us
Hahah I hate the U.S. Autocorrect
Yeah it is at Veris'
Where are we
Can I tell you something kinda sentimental
I look so gay
Sure
Lol you actually do
On October 24th when I was on the astronomy camping trip and you were away at Tufts, I remember finally realizing that I loved you
Like I've wanted to share that with you
Because like that was the day
I remember I was walking around and it was very cold and I was standing on sleeping bags 
Wow
When you brought up that boy that's what reminded me
Wow what
It just like hit you?
I guess it hit me too
It really did
And I'll remember when and where too
But I can't describe it
It was this overwhelming feeling where nothing else mattered to me and I felt so connected to you even though I couldn't see you or talk to you
Like I was so secure knowing that you were off at the university and I loved you and that was that
😍
And I remember the moment I felt it I just told Diviya because it was so beautiful
It's so strange lol
Do your parents stay up late when they have no work to do on these trips!
*?
Or do they bring their work with them?
No work!
That does sound beautiful
Actually I hate to use that as a segue, and I am glad we are talking like this now, I had great fun
But my dad said
I need to go to sleep
To wake up on time tomorrow
So I am sorry
B
🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢
Hahah no, I totally understand bb 
You enjoy your night in that St. Louis suburb
I had so much fun with you. More than I expected to have.
I was pretty nervous tbh
Nervous about what?
Letting you down or things being sad or something
It's silly :)
Anyway, sleep well and sweet dreams 😘🌚🐢
Goodnight!!!
"I am let down because your cock is suddenly too small for me. Bye bitch"
🌚🍆🌺
😘🐢🐢🐢
Hahaha how shallow 
Like my dick, I know
Here in STL, there are black guys. You know what black guys are? Hung. Bye
You didn't even have to say it 😭
😂
Lol don't you mean in STD
LOL
HIV
thanks for that study you sent earlier to provide comebacks 
don't you worry about having to use condoms later
It is just so depressing
The REAL struggles of being black lol
lol
Ok that was demeaning I'm sorry
Offensive
Having to use a condom
"Dick too big, pussy so tight from twerking, couldn't hit dat, had to get some"
Dome*
Lol I don't care
Anyway 
🐢
🌚
I assume that is a big Freedia quote lol
Ok anyway, yes!
🌚
Made it up
Well then there's a free compliment :) goodnight
Going through ferguson...
I mean on the highway.
Lol did anyone comment? Parents?
What did you see? Farm land?
That's how I've always imagined most of it
LOL
Omg I have a story
I'll tell it in a sec
Hahah okay. Well I just woke up so you tell your story and I'll do my thang
All is good
What's your "thang"
Anyway I didn't see much, from the highway it just looked like it had some empty strip malls and off brand stores
But 
When we were driving through some suburban farm land
My dad jokingly asked "is this ferguson??@
"
And I said something like "if it was, they would be even angrier, as it would be mocking their slave heritage" anyway that wasn't funny, but it is funny that you, after we had that conversation in the car, thought that ferguson was farm land
It's not farm land lol
Welcome to Illinois! Don't bootleg cigarettes!
First 2 signs of Illinois
Lol that's only because of This American Life. On the news it showed store shops being broken and city stuff, but for some reason I assume that each city has farm land on its outskirt. Like because Tucson has so much dry land surrounding it I assume every city is like that. Kinda how there's LA and then Bakersfield and other small, shitty CA farm land
Isn't that a safe assumption to make?
I say yes
I didn't think ferguson was that big anyway
Lol but I think it's funny that your dad and I assumed the same thing. What gave it away? How did you know it was ferguson?
Lol but it's an inner St. Louis suburb so like
South Tucson doesn't have farms
But that's fair
Lol I wonder how old that sign is. Is bootlegging substances even a thing anymore? I know moonshine
Strictly speaking, Tucson doesn't have farms, Marana does
Nah it's not big at all
And obviously I don't mean drugs
Also Illinois isn't hick town anymore, so you're safe for now
No he was joking lol
I saw on a map. There was no sign on the highway for Ferguson, only a billboard for the ferguson streetfest (lol)
I know, AND ITS SO PRETTY
No it's totally a thing
Because here we go from Republican land of low tax to Democrat land
So Missouri has lowish taxes on cigarettes 
And Illinois taxes suck
So people smuggle em in
Isn't it crazy to think that there are still riots going on in ferguson to this day
A state of emergency was recently declared on August 10th
No, south Tucson doesn't have farms but there certainly is a lot of empty land. I was mainly talking about Vail, Sahuarita, and Marana though.
Right right but like ferguson is an inner suburb like south Tucson
lol there is, however, the Tucson village farm!!
Jk
Idk if they have empty land in ferguson , didn't go check :(
I see your point though
Ahhhh... I shaved and I have no idea what I was waiting so long for. I feel fresh as fuck. How have you been keeping up with the razor?
Lol "ferguson street fest! Brutality! Molotov cocktails! And more!"
dia crews!
Oh that makes sense. What a strange job that must be, smuggling in tobacco across the border. Do they check you?
I assume not
I haven't shaved in almost four days and I feel like a mess
I see. That makes more sense then. I assumed ferguson was pretty big
Pic!$!$
I really need to shave every other day or every day to maintain a clean look and feel
no there's nothing at the border, no checkpoint, just a sign
Sorry b maybe soon
No place to stop
Awww, I'm sorry! Hopefully you can shave tonight when you shower or you find the time before you arrive. 
Where are you headed in Illinois?
Have you ever been to Chicago?
Do you know why there's a border check for California then? Is it only for major states?
Do you know the difference between hot and spicy
Yes, sorry, I fucked it up yesterday 
Fucked what up?
Lol
Lol I might be over it by night. I'd like to do the stubble thing at college
I have never been in Chicago, except the airport. You?
We are just driving through Illinois and Indiana to get to Columbus Ohio
I have no idea why they have on for CA. I think it may primarily be for immigration purposes? To  catch potential illegals coming from southern AZ into CA
I said that I thought it was cool to eat hot food
When I meant spicy food
Omg nooo I didn't mean it like that :( that sounds like such a dick thing to say. I was genuinely asking the question because my mom uses them interchangeably all the time.
But I was a bit confused yesterday when you said that because I thought you admired the guys who can eat steak straight from the grill 
The people who ignore the suggested cool time on soup boxes lol
That's such a funny idea
Why would you wait to do it when you could've done it all summer :(
"I'm gonna drink this coffee WITHOUT WAITING"
I felt that my parents and family friends would be uncomfortable
Same, only the Chicago airport
Y'all like my shitty facial hair
The church headquarters is in Cincinnati I think?
Lol not going there!
That's also what I thought it was. Or to catch drug traffickers.
I am going to Indianapolis though
Yes also used for drugs a lot
Lol yeah, I thought you thought the people who drink coffee straight had some unique skill
I think lil Wayne got caught there, and then also had a gun, and then went to prison
When it's hot
Lol were you willing to learn to drink straight coffee to be cool in my eyes
Believe it or not, I made myself hot tea this morning to test my limits based on what you said
I chickened out
I wanted to know what temperature I could handle, and as it turns out I can handle the one after 20 min of cooking lol
*cooling
What's so special about Indianapolis 
They have the racing event
Lol it's funny how Madeleine went to go see Lil Wayne but he didnt come on stage until 2 am and he only performed three songs
Hahahahaha that's so cute
And also you are a pussy
Nothing lol, it's just on the road
I think she left
He was still performing
Her mom was just over it
I miss you and I'll talk to you whenever I can! My day is starting now 😘 you have  a great day
😘
Lol yeah I know I am. I can handle spicy but not hot. I envy the people can do both, but I'm happy I can at least kinda handle one. My grandpa finds hummus spicy.
You should look up Munster, Indiana. That's the city I stayed in, and look for their pierogi festival 
As a testament to how fickle stocks are- I lost almost all the money I made, the sum profit is now around $50
Given, I believe it'll come up at some point
hummus lol
See that's the kind of guy that is probably straight laced indicated by lack of spice tolerance
Unfortunately it's nowhere near where I am in southern Indiana!
We are in Terre Haute, home of Indiana State and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
Not a fan of White Castle
But Steak 'n Shake was pretty good
Kind of like a slightly inferior steak burger
OHIO
I JUST SAW A SIGN
Clark county- birthplace of 4-H
Woop
Hey!!!!
Lol so can you withdraw the money you make from stocks any time you want?
You mean to say that southerners are unable to tolerate spice? Bc a lot of them seem straight laced.
Also what defines straight laced?
You say "home of..." as if everyone is expected to know the things you listed, lol. The guy who gave me the D.C. Tour is from Indiana and he is a Vice President of a school and a hockey referee, on top of being a tour guide
I told you White Castle is underwhelming!
I do want a burger now though :(
My mom has been making the shittiest food and she seems super incapable of knowing what to buy, so she asks me. It's not easy for me to compile a grocery list for her.
She asks me what are healthy things to buy and says she will get a head of lettuce
The Ohio people at 4H got all haughty about that when they gave a presentation 
How was your day today???
What does Ohio look like
You can sell the stocks but there's like a $8 fee for each trade (not for each stock) 
Idk not straight laced, just lame. So no, I don't meant southerners, I just mean people who don't do things
Why the sudden shitty food
Lol @ lettuce
My day was pretty. But I didn't do shit. Got to our hotel at like 5pm (2 your time) and have been working on some stuff for the doctor. Got rejected from the political review as expected. I'm not torn up at all about it, but it has brought out latent self-doubt. Oh well
Nooo! We've reached the 3-hour difference point :(
So then how do you make money off of it? This process confuses me
How do you even check your personal stocks
People who aren't willing to try exotic food or anal are the worst!!!!
The doctor still has you working?! What does he have you do?
I'm glad you're not torn up about it. You will find something more worth your time and something that will allow you to flourish.
That club probably wants people who have dedicated their lives to that kind of thing. I read one article from the political review and it was literally about the number of times GOP candidates said "God" this year vs. last year 
And which candidate shows the most dedication to religion 
You should sign up for the brown medicine magazine and submit your papers and resume :)
Lol I don't like writing
So if I were to do a journal, it could only be in an editorial capacity
Thanks for the suggestions, though!
You make money off of stocks by:
Example:
Buy 100 Apple stocks at $100
(+ $8 commission) 
The next week you sell the 100 stocks at $125  
(+ $8 commission)
So you bought for $10008
And you sold for $12492
You buy them through some service
I use fidelity investments I think 
And you can check on them there
But generally you can check their price online by googling the name of the stock
He just wanted some final shit
Mostly organizational and statistical
How was your day
Anal is in a way an exotic food all its own
Lol I literally looked up some medicine writing position at brown because I thought that was something you would do. Anthony does a literary magazine for Kenyon, he's an editor.
So you can claim the money that you sold your stock at?
Ok so a stock
Like the $12... - $10...?
Is a part of a company
Like a really small part
(Sorry for being a bit of a dick I know you were trying to help, I just don't wanna talk about it really)
So you can buy a portion of the company
And then later yes you can sell it
And if the market value rose
You earn
There is also a way to make money if you anticipate a stock to go down
But that's more complex
Do you have homework tonight
What's up
Are you upset
Hi I'm workin ;(
I'm free in 5 to talk
I'm here
How are you?
Did you ask because you wanted to do the FaceTime sexy stuff again haha?
My day was alright. Seth is getting with Linda. Carly is getting with Taylor. Diviya told me about how her and Nate had sex in the Guadalajara grill parking lot.
I gave my resignation letter to the manager and I might just work weekends or quiet
Quit
I'm sorry I didn't let you know I was working
What happened to Carly/Jay
I had to run in
I'm happy for Taylor though
Was it sudden
Everyone is quitting lol
You coming into work that is
No I knew I was going but I couldn't find time to tell you
How  many others are quitting 
Like five people lol
I was alone in here for like 1.5 hours so we could have chatted
One girl just walked out during her break
damn
In the bath?!
No my parents went out lol
You didn't tell me!!!!
Today I walked through my living room and I thought about how you came that one time and I got into my boxers 
Like in the living room
Carly and jay just hang out I guess
That panorama was actually beautiful
In Ohio?
You got into your boxers in the living room what?
Yeah Ohio, a rest stop lol
The rest is way nicer
Seriously it is incredibly pretty
Lol no that one time I called you over and we started doing things in the living room
This was more recent
Rest stops make me uncomfortable 
I don't like seeing a bunch of sweaty people or annoying children 
I avoid them at all costs. I would rather have a rest on the side of the road or some store lol
They were pretty quiet, no sweating or annoying people
#ohio
Can u talk or no?
Seriously it's mostly just old people getting stuff out of their cars
I have like 4 minutes left
No not really :(
Fuck this job so much
Oh yes! I recall you were like "can you come"
And then I was wearing shorts
I feel terrible for leaving you hanging
And you were wearing sweat pants
And you pressed against me
It's alright
I'm planning a trip anyway
Plus I was gonna watch a movie 
It's good
I mean I do have some time lol so I don't have to leave right away
Planning a trip?
Like your next stop?
well so
We have 800ish mile left and 3 days so
Do you experience the mean old people thing?? They're usually either really nice grannies or grumpy assholes
That means we can go wherever 
And do things
Come back to Tucson lol
Then fly to Rhode Island 
They are nice here actually. I hate to be so positive but I've experience nothing unpleasant
What movie are you going to watch?
Hahahaha I actually thought about how far shit was
You probably shouldn't torrent movies over hotel wifi lol
Idk maybe The King and I 
Got that covered b
I downloaded at home
What are some ideas you have in mind for what to do with the remaining days?
Oh haha I thought you were upset earlier because you forgot to do that
My idea was blueberry picking
That sounds so fun :(
You lucky bastard
But the season ended like last week
you should go see some lakes 
SOOO we are gonna take a scenic route in NY and other than that like go to some botanical gardens, maybe kayaking, eat food here
Yes we gon do that
I have to go now, love 😘 You finish your thoughts and I'll respond to you and I'll be there as much as possible 
You could actually spend the day in a real city
Or spend time in one state of choice for a while
I suggested Hershey Pennsylvania
Then I suggested using a morning to not do shit and chill, dad liked that
Bah bish
You gonna visit a factory there?
Lol watch sports and drink beer kinda morning
There were two great work moments I want to tell you about
Jay is sending me drunk video snapchats and he is shirtless
We are texting now and he's so sad. He drinks alone because he misses Elizabeth so much.
(very unhealthy)
I'm sorry I fell asleep
Yeah I had wanted to see Hershey world
He sent me one too
Poor guy
Elizabeth said
She shouldn't have given him the cognac cos now he gets sad and drinks
Which is a bad mindset for sure
I'm very very glad you haven't done that
Migratory. Geese.
.
.. back at ya
I think we would all love Columbus Ohio
It's like Tucson but with a bit more of everything
Still without the big city feel
No churches downtown
Lol you want to know something sad
I used to stay up until 1 am in Maryland to talk to you
I sent the period because I admire your minimalist messages recently. "OHIO" "Migratory. Geese." 
I only dream to be that brief 
As Rosinbum would say, "brevity is the soul of wit"
I'm sorry b!
But you are also a late night person in general, I thought?
That's also in Hamlet but we know who REALLY said it first (Rosi)
I've never been to any "____ world" so you need to let me know and take lots of pics. I have visited the eegee's factory and some dairy farm in Indiana. 
Rosy bum
I don't think we're going there though :(
She gave him cognac? Seeing Jay drink made me a little more inclined to do so but only because I was curious
where is eegee's factory
Yes her dad bought him a big bottle
Explain your migratory geese, sir!!!
Also, how interesting. Maybe that's why Kenyon is so close to Columbus and that's the spot the founders chose to establish the school.
I am a late night person but it messed up my attempt to get used to the time
I saw some geese flying overhead, like 3 packs of geese
:O sorry
They quacked
Nathaniel is happy because he has a letter to identify with from LGBTQQIA and UPenn asks if applicants identify with any one letter
His is ally
That's so demeaning to the culture and unfair
I can't believe that's real
"One time my jerk friend Taylor made a joke and I laughed"
Eegee's factory is on the south side-ish. It's like the poor kid version of going to M&M world. I was very unimpressed.
They were like the geese from winged migration
That's insane!!!!
That's creeeeeeeeseeyyy
Geeeeeeseeeyy
You changed your name!
I did
It still shows your name we call you on posts though :/
R u proud
Oh not on my view?
I got so happy the moment I saw you reply as Emmett on Facebook 
Oh that's bad
What direction were the geese headed
Have you lost sense of any direction? Sometimes in Tucson I find that happens to me
Yeah... especially since I'm under your profile already with the name change
When Taylor made the joke my jaw dropped 
the ally label is such a joke
"I'm.. Mmm. I guess I'm okay with gays? Does that make me an ally?"
Thx for tellin me b
"I like gays, I just don't support their marriage"
They were headed like west... I think
It rained SOO hard yesterday
Like we couldn't see shot
Shit
Around the IN/OH border
Yeah sometimes, but usually we are going east or northeast so
"I like gays, but I don't like cock" what is wrong with these people
No problem. What was weird was that Larissa's post still said Aimee but Sweeney's said Emmett.
Lol it rained like that on Monday for us and when I was talking to you there was crazy lightning
Did you guys have to pull over?
The Indiana weather is super fickle
I remember going out on a summer day to go swimming at a water park, and the moment we got to the park it was already overcast and pouring
Ohio apparently gets a lot of snow
Lol yeah that's true, so I guess you don't have an excuse
Is it Taylor's mom or dad that is Japanese
"I like gays, but I'm not gay myself" lol what's wrong with being a little gay? Fucking homophobic scum
We did stop because we figured it would be more dangerous to stop moving
Didn't 
Taylor's dad is Japanese and his mommy is white
Por que?
Ok yeah that's what I thought
Oh!
We were talking about community college
I have a master plan
?
Im going to suggest the five colleges to a bunch of people at school and whoever gets in will be my road trip buddy/buddies
Or even someone going to Boston
Looks like it might be Madeleine at this point
How would it be more dangerous to stop??
You mean him going to community college?
What does that have to do with race lol
Like cos they can't see where the road ends, so they are likely to hit you
There weren't any exits so
Oh god driving with Madeleine again........................................
It would be stopping in a shoulder
It doesn't, I was just talking about him to them
You want to drive to visit the colleges??
That would be like a 3 week trip
Which is good if you don't do a research project
Take ranya :(
Needin some latin love out here 
OHIO
that's true. I think of them like Tucson highways where you can pull off into the vast desert
What is a shoulder?
You said it once and I thought it was a typo lol
Not drive! If I get accepted to Northeasterb, BU, Boston College, Hampshire
*not drive to visit
Drive to actually attend
But yeah I'm thinking of taking up that guy on his offer. What if he lets me do a research project on the brown campus lol
How upset would you be if I slept with someone already?
At my work one of the gay xican guys, Alex (23 YO), said that he's been with savers for a year and his dream is manager 
Like that's his dream job
Also I found out yesterday that my manager's previous job was iHop... He's like 45.
These people are depressing
Shoulder is like the bike lane of a highway
That sounds fucking dangerous in a storm
Or even at night
Ah gotcha
Wait but
Or any time
I will be driving up to
I can be your road trip bud
Too*
Omg!!!!
I forgot about that!!!
I'll also be 18 :D
Holy shit, Aimee
You made my morning
I would be really upset if you slept with someone already because it meant you didn't mean what you had said about not sleeping around so quickly
Ok but the shoulders are bigger
Well I only have a sex drive for you and I was only curious because we don't have specific guidelines on how sex will work for us
Because Jay and Elizabeth do, but that seems really pressuring
I feel like I could go all year without needing to do that anyway
What are their guidelines
No I don't want that
I don't want you to go all year without, at all
Lol it's not like I'm going to go seek it though
That's what I mean
Lol as in not gonna join grindr?
I would hate to be texting you from Joseph's party as Oscar comes onto me or something 
Honestly, and tell me what you think of this
Go on
I think an explicit don't ask don't tell policy might be in order
On the other hand
If one of us gets involved with someone regularly, that would fall apart, as we wouldn't be able to share a part of our lives
Their guidelines: They both wanted to continue the relationship but jay says that he didn't want a gradual deterioration, so he gave her sexual freedom
What do you think about yourself getting with someone regularly?
I don't think I'll be one to hunker down with someone quickly in college at all. What do you think about yourself?
Ok because that's what I was scared about with you
I would be fine with you having sex and stuff but I couldn't handle you settling down
So basically you don't want me to leave you for another relationship
Yes... I don't think that's unreasonable, but I wouldn't stop you.
No I think that's fair and agreeable
If I have sex with someone, would you be upset to hear about it
I wouldn't, but if you have sex with that person many many many times then I probably would
For myself I know that sex is easily attainable but I'm actually not planning on doing anything about it
I feel the same way about you having sex, but not settling down. Also though, I would be a bit uncomfortable if you had sex with someone we both know. That said, I don't know that that's fair to impose upon you
If I feel comfortable and the situation arises then I would let the moment take me where it does, but I'm not going to go out of my way for anything when I love you
I definitely will not pursue anything further
Alright
You would be okay with me in another relationship?
I don't want you to think that any future sex I have is a reflection of lack of care for you. As I have made known since the beginning, sex for me can be purely physical. 
Um
I mean that would probably make us less close, but we could remain good friends. So if it made you happy, I would be okay, but it would change things, I imagine
Because the sex we have been having is such a personal and beautiful thing for me I feel sad letting that go
But I understand what you mean
:(
I feel that way too, but that's how it is 
I am really excited for you to come out here
We would have such a good time on a road trip
Ohio is cute as fuck
I have terrible dreams about people mistreating you, you know what I mean
That's my biggest fear
I just saw Demi's car on speedway and pantano going south lol
don't worry about me, especially that. 
I don't think I would be emotionally impacted by that kind of thing 
Lol
Did she hear about the Fb post
I'm excited too :) if I go to school up there we have to see each other on weekends and after school and stuff
I guess you wouldn't be but it would still hurt me, lol.
I don't think she did hear about the fb post but if that were me I would lol
Anyway bb boy I have to go now, but tell me everything 😘
Bye b!
Really digging "hero" by family of the year, the theme to boyhood
loved akron OHIO
also started The King and I, it's super cute and also kinda racially insensitive at the beginning
But I think the point is that they were both kinda racist and then got over it
What time did jay send the drunk snaps
PENN IS AWESOME
Penis awesome
 
This part of penn looks like evergreen state
Confederate flag #2 in Pennsyltucky
Looks like I don't have cellular Internet in Warren, PA :(
Looks like I don't have cellular Internet in Warren, PA :(
Lol
I actually do :)))))
Jk it sucks
Unidentified furry woodland creature
Picked cranberries
This small town in pa is so cute 
Old people have this bocce ball groups, and a little music group, and then all the little boys play football, and everyone comes out to see them. The bocce ball folks came to greet us and explain the game
This is so idyllic
 
 
 
 
 
Allegheny region of PA <3
Hey!
What's the King and so about?
*and I
Pennsylvania looks like an entirely different place
It's so beautiful 
The woodland creature looks like a little chubby beaver hahaha!
What's bocce ball? 
Those pictures are really fucking pretty!!!!!
There's something appealing about those small-knit communities where the kids can go out and play ball and stuff on meadows
How was your day today :)
I had my audition today and it was a huge mess because I was quiet during my song and Zayna said she has actually heard me sing before so she wanted me to redo it in private
But I felt uncomfortable so I couldn't do it
She's letting me be ensemble although she knows I could be the lead
Another beaver pic ;)
It's about a bitch who goes to teach the king's many kids in Thailand in 1860s
Bocce ball is a game where you throw a ball and it needs to stop close to the white ball. It's pretty dull
But their club has been active since 1990!
My day rocked
I'm sorry :(
How do you feel about it
My mom tripped and fell so that was kinda sad but she's ok, just a scrape. 
I felt really bad cos we were making fun of her for using a foam soup cup for a drink (to be fair it was next to the soda fountain, and no other cups were, and it was shaped like a wide and shallow cup), and a bit embarrassed so we walked a bit ahead of her back to the car when she tripped
It was a raw moment
What happened to your sugar gliders 
I was right! when I read another beaver pic I expected a nude lol
I don't think it's a beaver actually
It doesn't have the tail. I just thought it was a good joke. I was expecting you to expect that
I'm actually a lead in the musical
I'm really fucking scared
I'm Mareb, the 3rd most important character
I had the choice between a lead and ensemble after my audition
Congratulations!!!
Lol no one is ever given a choice, that's weird
Yay!
I'm sure you'll be great
When does it open?
Mareb sounds straight out of the Book of Mormon
Is it based off of an actual event? What kinds of things does she teach?
Did she fall while playing the game? For some reason it's hard for me to imagine adults falling and stuff. I feel like it's only little kids and old people
Awww those are the worst moments. When you're already feeling shitty about one thing and then BAM
My sugar gliders were sold lol. Thank god. Did you see any along the way?
What city are you in now?
It's part of the after school drama musical
So whenever that happens hahah
Well because there was a moment when I went from being quiet for my role to being passionate and vocal and it sounded good, I was cast as the guy in the end
Maybe it's reb. I'm probably not saying it right lol.
The drama teacher says she hears this potential in all of my monologues and singing that she knows is there and is waiting for to come out
What're you up to now?
I don't work tonight!
I don't know, I'm not far in yet, but I don't think it's based off of anything (but it's based off a Broadway musical, if that's what you mean)
There was a really uneven sidewalk
And she was wearing flip flops and not paying attention
Really could have happened to anyone
I tripped and fell like that a few weeks ago
Demi didn't go to school today for her first day of work at Walmart
LOL
What's Choward's violet??
No I didn't see any, but looking into what the woodland creature was reminded me
Omg
It's he best
We are in Warren, Pennsylvania
(Bumfuck) 
But nice bumfuck
Like dat prostate massage shit
But you already came out?
Jk
I am chillin, took a bath a bit ago
When is your last day at work
That's a sad look into her future
It's a lavender flavored candy. It is God 
I bought all this regional candy
Cos New England makes a lot of candy so there is a different and wider selection in stores
I've never heard of the musical. The plot sounded like something that actually happened in this modern day.
Did you not know what the creature was originally?
It's acceptable to have nice bumfuck when you're away from the south. Bumfuck Californians (like my church camp people) are cool
Turns out I'll be working weekends now. No more school days
Isn't it almost 10 over there?
Ugh
I was going to call you but this time zone thing is ridiculous 
Why can't the sun rays reach every part of the planet at the same time
Where else have you tried the candy?
How do you know it is your favorite
Let me send you some dick
Hopefully it will make up for my lack of communication and whatnot
It's damn famous, one of the old classics
-1 gay point
No, I still don't know
There's this animal that looks like a beaver and begins with a p
That sounds like a better schedule
Don't you dare fucking say platypus
Possum
It's not a possum
Noooo like papyrus or something
Obviously not that though
Pyramus
Ya it's late here but I'm awake
Pygamu
And thisbe
I just tried here. I had this candy with Tess from world market, so yeah
should you be awake though?
Thx for d
I do not want to keep you up
I'm ok being awake, but I can't really call right now
Maybe I should go to world market soon? Also I totally need to stop by your house to get the shoes
When will you watch Sense8!!!!
Yes, yes you do. I can't believe you haven't already... They are in the mail. Mail goes in the mail, they really need to be picked up
Idk, it might be a while :(
Nice pix
Also I need to watch Twin Peaks and narcos
I'm trying to keep you from losing interest lol
Flaccid penis has to work
When did jay send you his drunk snap(s)?
Losing interest in what 
No he did not 
Apparently he was skyping liz while sending them lol
Ok but they are in a different mailbox that the postman won't be touching, no?
No............
!!!!
There's only one
Cos you were supposed to pick it up promptly
It's ok
I thought you kept them in one of those rich people mailboxes on the side of the house 
Yes, that's our normal one
And that the mailman used the mailbox in the front
We don't have one up front!
Lose interest in this sexy beast 
Lol really?! He specifically used my name in a video and texted me for a while
"hey Sergio buddy I'm supervfucked up"
Did you talk to Elizabeth about it?
They got the  best time zones ever ugh 
Elizabeth can still send 4:20 snaps on time
Today I heard Zayna actually sing for the first time and it was interesting
And when I say that I think you know what I mean
Hell nah
👋🏻 to you twice yesterday
Yeah we did
Yeah, but on the other hand she's at a school with a core curriculum
Just kidding, time zones do matter
Hahahahaha. did she get the lead as always
I always though "trouser snake" was a pleasant term
Doing your duty to maintain the cutie
How did you wave to me when I couldn't even see you?
Making the time to keep you mine
I was saving the text before that
But then you said "duty..cutie" so I had to send it
In order to send the one that followed
Im awKwaRD!!!! xDDDD
OMG me 2 :DDDD
OHIO
oh.....hi.....oh....Im awKwaRD!!!! xDDDD
Migratory. Geese.
Is that a text I sent you in 8th grade?
I told you never to bring that up again!
"cummmmmmmmm"
I'm risky ^_^
Jennifer got the lead ❤️
Trouser snake sounds hot. Like let the snake in the garden. Let the snake tamper with the flowers.
Let the snake coil around the branches.
Inject it's venom
You're getting me too excited :(
thank gawd Im AWK thooooooo :333
I can't wait to party again next weekend ugh
Where is the Ben & Jerry's factory!! You should go see some awesome hometown for something... Sokethjg awesome sauce!!!
Yiu must be sleeping
No no sorry
I'm looking through old texts
Gimme a couple minutes?
Of course
Inject it's venom is really hot
What did Zayna get
Lol the oh...hi... Oh text was a combination of OHIO and the I'm awkward texts
That's a cute Diviya pic
I think it's in Vermont :(
You have to send snaps from party!
I'll send some from my first party
Ok I found some interesting old texts
 
These two aren't connected 
 
These two are
 
Sorry these are the Nicole texts in order
 
Proved me wrong :)
Also I am bad at predicting futures considering I dated both you and Nicole (pretty much had forgotten until now that I dated her).
Any past "relationships" of mine seem so fake 
Putting headphones in the headphone jack suddenly seems very sexual
Lifting up the part of the case that covers the hole
Alright well I'm headed to sleep so I hope you have a good night 
🌚😄🌺✈️🐢
I fell asleep and just woke up b in sorry
Hey I woke up again
I dreamt we were at a party together and that you were the director of the musical
Strike the bush and inject my venom into its roots
Zayna got the second main character girl, idk the name
I thought the oh... Hi..... Oh.... Was because of how much I say oh 
"You and Sophia give each other handjobs... You and Sophia do three-ways with animals" 
I. Find. It. So. Sad. That. You. Think. Of. . That. Way.
"They have a men's section!"
It's impossible for me to explain myself, I can kinda understand why you responded the way you did, and also you were an asshole lol
That's how I feel too regarding relationship. It's crazy for me to think that I have actually had a pretty stable relationship with someone for over a year, you know? I never expected that out of my high school experience.
Getting into bed suddenly seems very sexual. Placing your body, your vessel, deep into the depths of the warm sheets
You should tell me what you've been dreaming about recently
Lol as if people focused on language are incapable of sounding intellectual about other things without proper knowledge on them.
"X-Large or Large?"
I had a dream that a group including me, you, Gloria, Diviya, and others that I don't remember we're drinking in the front driveway of my family friend's house. I chugged a whole cup of coke and beer. Then a sheriff drove through the driveway, we were like WTF, made a loop, and came back to get us. I got the hint after he drove through, and ran. But the others didn't. I forgot my keys, but by the time he got back I was running through the alley to freedom.
Also this sheriff's car was a turquoise and white SUV
I don't think you are bad in these texts, I just think they are interesting. I deliberately chose them not to pick on you.
Lili Younce?
The funniest to me was the "large? X-large?" Ow bitch
There was an officer in my dream, although I don't remember why! I remember getting pulled over with a group of friends:
you let us all perish in your hands. We know how you truly feel about everyone, thanks.
Oh! I didn't see "Lili", I saw "Lil Younce"
I thought that was her stage name or something
You know, I do think I had some wild things going on in my mind that I didn't exactly know how to channel into something productive 
Lol I was also incredibly insensitive, not by fault of my intentions but by experience
Do you also think about what time it is for me?
This picture makes me so uncomfortable. This the profile picture of that chubby Asian kid from MUN, Nathan Zou
Ya I do, go to sleep
To be fair you texted me first
??? I fell asleep at 8???
At fucking 4:32AM
That's 8.5 hours of sleep
Eh, I feared the wrath of my mother. All bets are off with her
Lol Lil Younce
What do you mean "by experience"
He always has weird pics
I wonder how many fucks the dorm officers and RAs give about loud parties. You always see snaps of people getting crazy and shit, but then you hear stories of people getting arrested from their dorm.
Beer pong is big at brown, if I remember correctly
Minimal weed
Which makes no sense to me?
By experience I mean that I hadn't had exposure to a lot of material, and thus I couldn't speak on it
Like knowing certain idioms or societal functions and systems
Lol what
What's always confuses me is the art of a conversation, because there are people capable of having brilliant conversations without any knowledge and vice versa
That's what I mean
Where did you get that impression of brown? That's Dartmouth more like
I don't think there are any arrests at brown
lol then tell me about brown, Mr. Brown
There are arrests at UA
Idk I didn't attend any parties but I know they have hella weed
It's really stupid IMO
Arresting kids for parties near campus
Everyone knows everyone does it
Lol that's often me, I usually don't know much at all
Sorry the "lol what" was at the brown comment 
Not at the comment about your knowledge back then. That would be really mean
I swear to god you said there was no weed at brown and that's one reason why you chose it
Like all weed and no drinking
Or it might've been the other way around?
A lot of drinking, even more weed at brown
Something about a lot of one thing and barely any of the other
That's where I think we were being a little paranoid about the parties we went to
Unless your parents were home
Lol I was thinking more like a conversation with a homeless person than with you
Ok but who is denying that I was less intelligent then that I am now
*than
Hydrangeas are purple
I'll give you a nurple--
Oh wait!
Horseplay is not allowed
When you told me you were going to look at old texts I thought you meant it about us when the conversations were actually meaningful lol
You never went into great detail, or any detail, in your 9th grade texts 
When I was at work there was an older lady, maybe 72, who told me that she lived alone and was looking to make some friends, so she asked me if I saw any movies. Then she told me that she saw Straight Outta Compton and loved every bit of it; we ended up having a discussion about police brutality and how rap is an effective medium for the underprivileged (kudos to your Williams essay), and she asked me if I knew any rap for her to listen to with similar messages. I couldn't think of anyone else besides Kanye. 
It was all unexpected and adorable
There's a snapchat story titled "Farm Life" featuring a calf being born...... 
yayyyyy
Sorry b my phone had died

Great prep for your life as a doctor
"Some of our conservative citizens do not want non-Islamic Westerners coming and stirring up our people with liberal ideas. And we certainly do not need the bad publicity if you are hurt or killed in our country by some radical.” 
What a xenophobic rationale
Nvm the a lot and little text lol
Omg did you get the old lady's number
I wanna call her
And meet her
I understand their concern about an uprising but it's not like America or other countries don't take the risk of allowing people with radical ideas their right to freedom 
If anything, suppression only irritates the people
I have her visa number in my cash register records!
And by extension, her name
She was the most bad ass lady I've ever met
Eh, they don't have finesse but their point is valid, and at least they are giving good rationale. Xenophobia doesn't matter in other places. We pride ourselves on not being racist, xenophobic, whatever. Other places don't care
I'll read the article soon 
Lol that's a privacy violation 
Pretty sure she would be ok with it though
Suppression can instill fear and cause order
This town is so cute
I love everything out here 
Ohio and Pennsylvania are my jam
There are major Harvard and Yale streets in almost every city I have seen. Also Dartmouth streets everywhere
Sorry, I'm making my breakfast now. My new thing is adding obscure spices and powders to my food, thanks to you, again. I heard about how ravishing your ginger eggs are.
Hahaha, I just threw it together, nothing to be proud of
What's the spice today
Did your mom stop buying organic fake meat products
Confederate flag #3
Okay but do you not think it is sad when you hear suppressed people speak about an issue and they sound ignorant about a topic because of the views their government has imposed on them their entire lives? I feel like the freedom cultivates the mind and encourages critical thinking.
Lol she would probably think she gave me her contact info
Which town are you in now?
Lol just like tucson's Amherst and Williams streets! I wonder why they're given those names?
What does your mom know about me? And what does she think about you leaving?
Today is a bunch of chili powder. My mom said, "no! Why did you use that one?! I have organic chili powder in this drawer here!!!0
Okay but do you not think it is sad when you hear suppressed people speak about an issue and they sound ignorant about a topic because of the views their 
Lol nope! I had tofu and veggies for lunch yesterday, which isn't fake "meat" products but it's meat replacement. Idk what your problem with it is though; if 
you ate MY veggie food you would love it. 
government has imposed on them their entire lives? I feel like the freedom cultivates the mind and encourages critical thinking.
What does your mom know about me? And what does she think about you leaving?
What keeps happening? Does your phone keep dying or is it service lol
I will pray to God one time, and only one time, for your phone's battery
I'm going to look like such a prick at Joseph's bringing my own Stoli shot glass
I do think it's sad to see that, for sure
I am in Kane, PA!
She doesn't know much. She seems pretty sad and sentimental, but keeping it together for the road trip
Lol organic chili powder
I didn't have service
First it was dead, then it didn't have service
Stoli!
Any homework last night?
The choward candy tastes like fabuloso cleaner smells I think
Kane, PA, the Black Cherry Capital of the World, population 3,691! (Wikipedia)
Living there would probably get boring.
I see how appealing the small life can be from an outsider's perspective though
Is your dad bleh about the whole thing?
-rawr means i wuv u in dinosaur xP
lol yeah and she loved my potatoes. She called them my "new creation"
Yes, Stoli 😘 I'm putting your presents to use this week
No homework last night. I'm not gonna have much at all until next week.
Lol we don't use that, but I do smell lavender air freshener 
*we do use lavender air
We did not see any cherries actually whoa
"Kane is known as the Black Cherry Capital of the World because of its thick forest cover and strong logging industry."
Yeah but I think it's a facade for him
Wait not for actual cherries?
Oh cherry tree?
It didn't say hahah, but I don't see how black cherries are related to a thick forest cover. Unless it's a tree?
And that certain tree is what primarily constitutes the forest
That's what I thought 
I think about how parents must feel because they're not all that different from us.  Like the way I imagine your parents is how young they must feel again. The entire house is theirs and they can relive their parentless days, reviving their sex life and committing energy to each other
Sorry I didn't have service
That's okay! Text me when you do, love 😛
I think that's a typical American way to feel when kids move out, but I don't think my parents feel that way. They are weird 
I'm gonna work on getting a Spanish or Portuguese passport! Then I can work in the EU in the future. Any Jews kicked out in the inquisition are entitled to citizenship these days.
Yo bitch
I'm out of school now
Why are you so angry with your selfies 
Today Joseph was really upset and when I was telling him about my problems first, he got super emotional and taken aback because he wasn't aware of how fucked up my life is. Then then I asked what was wrong with him he felt guilty because his troubles were "in pale comparison" to mine
But that upset me because I still care about his feelings and I don't want him to feel guilty for anything
He kept apologizing and commenting
Wouldn't that mean only your parents get the passport...?
Or like grandparents
Because they actually have family in Europe. Idk I feel like it would affect them more directly than you.
But anyway, what do you plan on doing with the EU?
How was your day today?
No, it's for anyone of Iberian Jewish heritage
It's just if I want to easily travel or work there
It's sweet that he was so compassionate though
My day was chill. Nothing interesting. We spent all day driving through Pennsylvania. Here's some pics
Pics turned out bad, shit
 
 
We just got food at a deli in Scranton, PA
Seems like a rough place
HW today?
Only drama homework
Anyway, I want to address the way we will be communicating
Because I feel that this time zone thing is an issue and idk
I think sudden deterioration sounds sad
I don't expect you to talk to me all the time, or at all if you don't want to
Have you been waking up too early to communicate?
Because otherwise, from my perspective, we talk about as much as we have always
But also, once I start school, I will likely be staying up later, which will facilitate evening chat
Oh shit!!! You're almost in NY. You're closer than I expected.
Yeah we are sleeping in NY tonight
It seems dreamlike to have forest surrounding the highway
It is 
I know, but I don't want you to force yourself to talk to me
And the forest coated hills
Or because you're bored
Sergio jones once and for all, I talk to you because I like to talk to you, never because I feel obligated to.
Sergio Jones
Never once have I been irritated or bored
Sorry
I love it when you say my name
No, don't be sorry. I actually do.
It's so hot
Oh I thought you were mad I didn't capitalize
Hahaha
Like even in conversation when you refer to me
What city are you seeing in NY? Isn't Syracuse more north than you need to go?
Today Demi was laughing about getting a 1 on her calc AB AP
I'm not gonna deny that we might not chat as much once my school starts, but I think there will be time, and any chat we have is chat I want to be having
Did she end up passing any
Her entire college situation saddens me
Yeah my mom decided to bypass upstate NY in favor of a scenic road in PA. Don't know if it was worth it but it's no big deal
We are going to Port Jervis, NY
And then passing through like Poughkeepsie
We might go through MA or maybe CT. Undecided.
I don't think communication will be an issue though. I don't have a job. I don't have clubs. I will have enough time
What's the name of that band that you and Reyna like
That has one popular song that I knew
Indie
It doesn't even feel like 3pm on my end because I woke up from a nap right now
And it's overcast there
Missing you 😘
Aren't you in school?
How did you take a nap
😍
She probably passed something. She's looking at public schools in Florida.
It's probably safe for you to pass upstate NY. Have you ever been to CT before? Is it shitty to visit other college campuses since you're going to brown? You could look at vassar for me
It's in Poughkeepsie 
Port Jervis is named one of the top 10 coolest small cities!
*towns
There's grouplove 
Lol I told you I'm out of school
I left early
Oh yeah sorry I missed that message
Why out so early
Thanks it was grouplove
Public universities?
That might actually work
But how would she pay
What do you mean that it's safe?
If it's mostly on the way I'll check it out
I saw UNM, so I think it's fine! But my mom wanted me to visit Cornell and I said no cod that's weird 
Cos
I flew into CT on my way to Amherst, so kind of
Whoa! I hope it's that cool. I might go canoeing tomorrow on the river there, maybe I'll canoe across into New Jersey
The man is here to observe us and scope out our home, which is very uncomfortable. Yesterday morning my grandpa tried to guilt me into staying nearby Tucson for college because I need to take care of my mom... He said it's not a good idea to go where I want to go.
He's going through all of our rooms and stuff
Our desks and closets
It is as uncomfortable as it sounds
What did you tell your grandpa? 
Are you listening to grouplove right now, haha?
It's safe as in you probably won't be missing anything and Connecticut seems like a better use of time.
Just saying, if he gets more pushy about it, you need to keep yourself in mind and not sideline yourself for people that often haven't kept you in mind. Of course I know you know this. But I want to explicitly support you in that. 
Although Weinstein would be impressed
He went through everything?
I would be so peeved
That makes me uncomfortable 
Hahaha go to Cornell and visit holly!
I so disagree! CT is like industrial and urban hell IMO!
Lol I listened to like 2 songs and then became disinterested
Jervis is also nicknamed "The Gateway to the Upper Delaware River"
Canoeing sounds serene as fuck, god I would love to do that
Rowing seems like such an awesome activity to do in college
I nodded my head as if that was my plan all along, but of course the decision to leave has been present in my heart all along. My appreciation for Tucson does not overpower my desire to leave.
But thank you :)
Lol it's hardcore, the college rowing teams
But still nice to wake up and do a dawn row to start the day
You didn't tell him no, or imply no?
you can't just mislead like that
Even though it's hard
We had to do family cookie making...
Like they had us do a family activity which was to bake cookies and we answered group questions
Lol well also I've never been to CT. Because Yale is there I imagine a comfortable and attractive city with rocky shred.
*rocky shores
Lol honestly I don't even like the group that much
Hahahaha Yale is in a hell hole
Ask Martha
That sounds weird. How was it?
What kind of questions did they ask?
And was Richie there?
There was so much passive aggressiveness during that family activity. One question was how should we solve problems, and answers were "maybe you shouldn't call me a fag :)" and "don't hit the other person, even if they *insert previous encounter*"
Yeah, he showed up for this one thing
Lol I know, but the rest of Connecticut 
There has to be something appealing
My dad's billionaire friend sent his problem son to a monastery in the Himalayas for a year to grow up. That worked, and scared his other kids into being better too
I figured you guys would all be nice to each other in front of this observer...
Lol well college is also the place for people to start participating in a new interest
Like beginning dance! I want to take that
Oh the rest of it is mostly urban I think. I'll let you know if we go through there
Open curriculum will be so good for me because I want to try everything
For one year at what age? Parents threatening to send kids to boarding school, etc. seems like such a joke!
18, shit was serious 
Nina's soon-to-be roommate went to Nepal for some church work and came back "not an asshole", and she thinks it's because it was since he went to Nepal 
If you go to Hampshire you can't become a pot-smoking hippie
But I was like "Nina... He went for church work. That shit changes people, no matter where you go"
Aka Joseph's mom
Did she live with him before Nepal?
*It's because he went to Nepal 
Lol you were kind of more of a jerk after camp
Like all religious judgy
I figured we would be all nice too lol
What do you mean?
Religious judgy because I felt it was my duty to make you guys see God's light
Which sounds awful
they were purely suggestions
Nothing with malicious intent
How did Joseph's mom like Hampshire? I should ask him about that
No she didn't, he's Ivan's friend who wants to move in with them lol
She's kinda uncomfortable with it, but it's whatever 
"What do you mean?" ?
About what?
"I figured we would be all nice too lol"
I don't think she's said shit about Hampshire to me
Oh, that's actually kinda unfortunate. Like if I f had my first live-in bf I would not want a roommate
Probzzzzz bc you don't seem like the free flowing small liberal arts college kinda person
Did you see my Instagram tags?
Well I didn't expect him to be such a shithead. He's been an asshole the entire time.
I knowwww, me neither!!! 
I feel like sex would be the most awkward thing in the world. It'd be like if Reyna lived with us. I couldn't bear the awkwardness.
I was so happy today thinking about when you saw me after DC in your car and you were like "Sergio, I've missed you so much!"
Are you guys still driving?
Ya, thx! Very cute photos and panda
Lol if Reyna lived with us
You would let her sit in a chair and read and occasionally comment while we fucked openly
In the same room
:)
We just got to the place, it's a really nice Best Western. Like really nice interior, and it's on a lake
Matamora, PA
The 4-H conference meeting rooms
But thanks for all the research on Port Jervis
Hahahahaha omg lasers
The 4-H conference meeting rooms
Lol that video
Cute as fuck building 
 
Lol Diviya's mom
Lol earlier this week I told Diviya that I missed her family. During a family dinner Keshav's step-dad apparently said, "tell Sergio I'm back in town" and everyone just looked at him
Keshav's mom suspects he's closet bi
I found that hilarious
Lol omg noooo I value intimacy, which usually comes with privacy. Maybe you're saying what you wish you could do in my words
Fuck! In the morning you should send a video, but at least a pic
Lol of course. Whenever you send a new destination I get all excited and read about it
Like I've said before, I feel like I'm traveling vicariously through you and I accept anything you have to share with me :)
Please stay my favorite person!!! 🌺🌺🌺 God I miss you so much
I hope you are enjoying every bit of your trip
I get so sad every time Alex cries when he has to go to his dad's :(
Ahahahaha. Aren't they divorced?
That Keshav is bi or his dad?
Lol "🌺🌺🌺 God I miss you so much"
I miss you too!!🍆!🍆!!🍆
I am enjoying!
How often does he go there?
Pic?
Lol no, the attractive Indian guy (Keshav's stepdad) said this about me
His wife suspects he is bi
Oh oh whoops
Did she say why she suspects
Hahah flowers are also pretty
For me the flower is both the sex and your beauty
He goes there every other week
I have to go to work now :/ this is my last week working during the week
I am taking a bath so
That's happening 
Aw shiiiit
Aight
YOU should send pics though :)
Probably because he's metro and makes comments like that lol
Please send pics
I'll send you some for your next bath :)
Hold on horny toad
Ok!
I will send soon
Horny toad lol
How cute
I imagine winkelman as a college student was like lil dicky
I'm not on register lol
I can still text you
But I guess you deserve a break haha
What are you doing instead
Did you open the pics
I'm doing general recovery on the sales floor lol
Probably because of his posture haha
He seems poised in a dickish way, you know?
Posture says so much
Normal posture means an average person
You decide the way people perceive you
My manager saw a kid who didn't take his 15 min break and said "God, I hate overachievers"
Your penis posture 
Lol, if only he met basis
So I am an inferior person because I have shit posture
I think they just look similar tbh
General recovery?
Seriously though your penis posture on clerk
Fleek
I think most guys position so it's not all hanging out
But you have no fucks in dress pants 
One think winkie does often is check out girls
Thing
I heard Panteha say that
And I really disagree
I think it inevitably happens to everyone from time to time, and since everyone thinks it's a thing they notice when he inadvertently does it. That's just my opinion though
Dreaming of you 😴
Also your 🍆
Gotta sleep so I hope work goes ok
🌚
Hahaha
He seems to lack a certain willpower that committed people usually have
I will admit it is a natural thing to do, however when I find myself staring at someone I remind myself that I'm with you for a reason
Then I act disinterested and feel disinterested 
Haha yes! Poised in a dickish way - when the penis curves upright
Lol my mexican manager thought chamoy was an "African dish"
No! Of course you are not inferior, but when you look at certain people they just look more confident. There are studies on this kinda shit.
General recovery is getting all the clothes that are half hanged on hangers fully on the hanger, picking up clothes, and hanging shit. It's tiring as fuck.
"Your penis posture on clerk" are you suggesting I pull it out when ringing up customers?
Lol the position thing is not real. I naturally have one that bulges out, not all guys do though.
When I had my personal meeting with him in class he kept looking off, and when I followed his trail he was staring at Reyna's ass
You know, I think we would have had so much fun if you worked at savers on weekends
Because if I had someone cool to pass the time with then I would enjoy it a lot more
I asked gay xican today what his obsession with knowing people's sexuality is, and he got all flirty
Also something stupid that I probably shouldn't tell you but I will anyway because why not
When we weren't together after Lucky Stiff, I used to perform "Fancy eting You Here" and practice it over and over again, changing the name from Tony to Aimee
I had planned on sending it to you in voice recording to get back with you
D-reaming of you 🌺
God I love you!!!!
 
Have a good night my best friend 🐢🌺🌚 lets skype or call tomorrow
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU ARE LOVED ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh god, I had the worst dream ever. My mom decided it would be a good idea to get back with Ritchie's Dad, and the entire dream is about how he has to spend time alone with me in order to prove it that he can take care of us
Only he's drunk and violent
So I woke up waaaay earlier than I'm supposed to because it was actually the worst dream ever
I had a dream you guys bought me pads 
It was not nice
Who's "you guys"?
Hahaha I can imagine you singing fancy meeting you here
How was your meeting with wink
That's terrible :( I'm sorry you had a dream about that
I don't recall, otherwise I would have specified 
Your dream sounds hellish
Loved the video
Winky was okay. He suggested Rutgers U. for me because of their U.S. history department lol... 
He's obviously a little less experienced than kitty
I'm so sore from working last night :(
My feet feel like they are going to break in half
What's your plan today? Que honda
What's your flirting policy
For a second I read that as "I'm so sore from working the kitty last night"
Honda Pilot 
That's the car
Flirt as you will, to your heart's content
Idk if you read the group chat last night but Jay was still babing up Elizabeth
Ha. Ha. Ha. You.... are like.... the epitome of.... comedic
Anyway, have a good day
You going to school now?
We are headed to PROVIDENCE YA
Right now in NY
it's already more coastal looking
It looks like San Fran here in NY
Which is weird
No lol but I feel annoying.
How sudden?! Part of you must be anxious to get there and another part must be hesitant to stop the road trip. 
The Rhode Island shores in irrational man looked artsy as fuck. You need to go at least once and send pics.
I wish I knew what coastal meant
I should hope that I visit the coast (less than a mile away) at least once in my four years. Otherwise I might as well be at UChicago
Yeah I saw the group chat though
I'm glad it's around
I'm not even tired of road tripping yet
This has been the most pleasant family trip ever
You ever been to the beach b?
Why is flirting okay but sex not? Don't you feel like one thing leads to another?
Lol Chicago also has a coast??? Probably not as rocky and charming though. 
*entire family takes shrooms while camping* 
"This has been the most pleasant family trip ever*
I've been to the San Diego beach but it was gross
sex is ok, I just thought you wanted to wait a bit to sex 
Lol that's a lake coast tho
We saw some mushrooms today but they were just mushrooms
The best beach experiences I had were in Israel
Come to think of it, I think the only other beach times were in like Venice Beach, and I didn't do much there cos there were so many people. Also Oregon beach but I barely went on it and it was cold
I do. So are we enacting the don't ask don't tell policy for this then?
I visited some lake in Indiana but it definitely wasn't Lake Michigan
Anyway, I hated it lol. Too cold.
The Dead Sea is on my top 10 places to travel 
Same with the beaches in Santorini
You know I have never been to the Dead Sea
Just like the Grand Canyon 
I was typing an explanation for why Oregon beaches look perfect but I erased it because I don't think I need to
No do it
Oh because I think we would both be hurt if the other slept with someone, at any point really
Wait but you didn't go to Oregon?
Let's rethink the policy
What, in your mind, is the policy currently?
What would you prefer in terms of changes
The lady welcoming us to NY in a toll booth said "have a blessed day" 
*feeling blessed 😇*
Well actually she was just welcoming us to the east side of the Hudson River (surprisingly wide river)
I've seen numerous pictures because I had developed an infatuation in 9th grade haha. Some tumblr crush lived there. Anyway... 
The beaches seem to serve as the perfect muse, a place to take a stress relieving walk. I dream of walking along the rocks, idk. Travel turns me on. 
Hahaha wow, you don't feel blessed after you got dick last week?!
That shit should have lasted for a while. I'm disappointed in you.
Well for policy
When people flirt with me I feel uncomfortable. It's nothing to do with a matter of wanting to, but I feel committed to you already and I know it's something you wouldn't appreciate.
And like last night the gay boy was so gross
Lol so all my pictures this week make you hard? Nature and flowers 
Trying to invite Himself to Joseph's party
Did you open my pics 
Ew
Idk more or less Sergio 
And this is kinda hypocritical
I want you to be with people who are good and respectable people and not slimy or otherwise disrespectful to you 
I feel that you are exposed to many more undesirables than I will, in that Brown is a select environment 
Bless by 🍆😇
Blessed*
Trying to invite himself is just rude no matter who he is though
NY so cute
All foresty with vines n shit
Undesirables evokes images of lepers and herpes
How is that hypocritical?
Haha yes, they make my nature/travel boner hard. When we took our nature hikes and you were able to identify almost everything I was so charmed by you, it was the most adorable thing every
*rver
I did open your pics!!! Your ass is beautiful, ughhhh
I miss playing with it :(
Or rubbing my dick against it when we're cuddling
Also he pretends like he's my dad (?), like he'll yell at me for something
I spilled water yesterday on accident and he was telling me to pick it up and laughing about how he sounded like my papi
I have been day dreaming of you rubbing your dick on me (not my back)
And he gets stupid by pretending to spank me
And sleeping nude
Or like he's about to do that
And when I say I have a boyfriend he says, "well he's gone, soooo"
To me it's more about him disrespecting you and I than anything else
This all happened yesterday btw
How old is he that he pretends to be a daddy
Holly took an amazing picture of the Cornell campus, I have to send it
I keep daydreaming about you getting wet from your seat, and when I finally put my hand down your pants and rub you I can feel how warm and damp your boxers are
Hanjing sent a snap entitled
He's 21
"Awkward clubbing experience #2"
It's also kinda creepy that he doesn't care that you are underage
Send the holly pic
I'm going to never get tired of saying this, and, at least for me, it will never lose its meaning but I love you!!!!
😍
I'm sorry lol
I get these overwhelming desires for you in every way
Why sorry?
Hahaha isn't she at ASU? I cant believe 18 year olds can go clubbing 
I don't want you to feel that it's meaningless or overused
She's 20 I think 
I feel that way when I repeatedly say it, but not when you do
She's at ASU tho
Yeah I know, but because everyone else at work is at least 19 they think of me as an adult
That's a pic with a lot of filter
What are you going to do for the policy? what are your commitments and practices going to be?
Lol you've said it once?! I love hearing it more than anything. The way I like to think of it is that if you don't get annoyed when I say it then I will also not get annoyed
How is she 20??
It's more for me though, I like to save it for very special moments 
Maybe I'll change my ideas about the phrase in time
For me there are different ways to say it that have different meanings
But it doesn't change how I feel for you
It still means a lot for me to say it over text
You know in Warren, PA, we tried to go to a different hotel cos the Holiday Inn was ugly and didn't have breakfast. So we went to this local place which was gross, and in the elevator was the elevator certificate, and lo and behold it used to be a super 8 motel
I'll consider that in the future, thank you. 
Like I don't wanna say it at this moment because I think we would interpret it as forced, but I plan on being less restrictive with my usage
You can't tell where towns are here because they leave the area next to the highway forested 
So I can drive through towns and not notice
Same way in parts of the Bay Area 
With leaves present, as in the summer, brown looks like Claremont or especially Berkeley 
AKA we made it
RI, at least where we drove, is ugly AF tho. Like NY is nice, CT is nicer, and then you cross the border into RI.
RI had a rest stop that was just a concrete parking area without even marked parking spots. No toilet, no vending machines, nothing. 
Hey what's up
Lol I have no opposition to motels in any way, except for the sheets and exterior
How is it so far!!!!
Have you met your roommate yet??!
I miss you
I walked into Target here, and it is almost the same setup. Easy to forget how far from home I am
I'm shopping and I hate it. 
We get into the dorms first thing tomorrow, so not yet! 
Tell mercury thingy 
*everythig lol
Close! It's spelled "everything" :)
Gotta get my dick out once a day
;)
Gotta be a dick as a result of sucking yours #iamwhatieat
The font of the license plates here is the same as that use for titles of woody Allen films
Like irrational man
As I was texting you, Zayna said "What is this?!" and she took my phone and read the recent text I sent you, threw my phone on the window ledge area, and called me pathetic
Then she left
Did she read my mean response 😮
No, she read my first 4 texts to you 
Is your phone ok
Assuming yes
Why?
Oh because she threw it lol
Hahah what are you shopping for? What's strange is how comfortable you will be in RI soon, you know?
How was your day today?
When do classes start?
Lol every time my penis goes flaccid your ego inflates
This morning for my potatoes I put lemon juice and chili powder again, but only after not liking my mom's "version" of my potatoes from yesterday
She said I probably didn't like the "organic chili powder taste" lmfao as if it made a difference
That RI rest stop is hilarious. I presume it's because you aren't far from something anyway lol.
I once read a thing that told me how long it takes to drive around the entire state of rhode island
But I forget!!!!!
Today I need to tell you about seminar class
And the discussion
Also about me and Nate and the Syrian refugee kid drowning
I miss you too and you have no idea how happy I am that you arrived there safely ❤️❤️❤️
And I need to tell you about my call with Carleton and the response I received from Amherst!!!
I miss you too and you have no idea how happy I am that you arrived 
there safely ❤️❤️❤️
We are shopping for odds and ends- underwear, drawers, tack for posters. Random shit
My day was pretty. Love CT
Classes start on the 9th
Why would that make my ego inflate?
It's like an hour around the whole thing with a bit of traffic lol
Who do you make your potatoes again?
What happened with the colleges?!?
And the discussion
Though I might have time to chat I don't want to be left in suspense about the colleges
Hahah I'm at a dinner now
So I'll reply to the other stuff soon
But for Carleton I called and the lady wanted to know about my academic transformation, and she said I'm such a strong student now and that I did great on my tests and essay
Amherst told me that for my application to focus on my grades in sophomore year, specifically through my Rec letters and college counselor
What did you tell the Carleton lady? Those sound like great things to hear from college counsellors
Admissions officers*
Feel free to reply after dinner
Hahha "CT IS AN INDUSTRIAL SHIT HOLE!!!"
What changed?
No, like a reverse thing. My penis goes up and you are submissive to me because you suck me. My penis goes down and you get "your dick out" and get all snobby hahah
Made sense in my head
I make my own potatoes but my mom wanted to try making them my way
I'll tell you about seminar and Nate soon :)
Just found out right now that Richie has ADHD
I feel like these days ADHD = shithead and gives and excuse to continue to be shitty
It's over diagnosed
I really don't believe in it 99% of the time
Lol doesn't make a ton of sense but I am submissive to your cock so sure
I guess I get it
Sub in the bed, ego otherwise
I'm out of dinner now
I literally told my mom that ADHD does not excuse shit. Back in the day these problems would not persist.
This comes down to the whole sentimental protective thing 
Which is actually what we talked about in seminar
Today Jay said something during class discussion that I completely disagreed with (about identity), and there was a super dramatic and intimate moment between myself and the entire class
Like they were all looking at me, Every single person, and I talked about coming out
And Nathaniel said it was so intense that it felt like I was literally coming out to the entire class
Also today we were talking about how Rosinbum cried over a picture of the dead Syrian boy who drowned in a puddle, and after school Martha and Nate and I decided to look at it
But when I saw it I made a face because it looked like the kid was just taking a nap and Nathaniel lost his shit and Martha got all defensive and upset with us
Lol we need to have balanced power dynamic and that is how we achieve it
Well today in seminar we talked in microaggressions. We discussed the same Atlantic article I sent you
What's funny is that you're the person who buys tacks for poster when tape will suffice for me
No no it's wouldn't
It wouldn't
Because it's a poster and cannot be ripped 
If I put tape on, I could easily damage the poster
I guess I've never had a poster I cared about enough for that hahah
I would be open to new poster each year, but the Klimt print is like $100 so I would feel bad 
The difference between the two scenarios
Is that the ADHD and overprotection permits him to continue to be a jerk, and the hypersensitivity thing prevents people from doing like anything (and I guess also allows the SJWs to be butthurt jerks)
whenever I see those videos you send me from feminist blogs I'm like "is this actually media that SJWs would approve of?"
I honestly cannot imagine those people enjoying anything without deconstructing it to somehow be offensive
What did you disagree about
Haha which posters are you hanging up?
Also, where are you staying tonight?
Exactly, but I'm unafraid to call out the bullshit of the ADHD. That's where I think you're wrong about me and sensitivity, however I will admit I'm sentimental at times, only for a good reason though.
Hahaha which feminist blogs?
What's ridiculous is mandating what a teacher can and can't teach, especially when it's a course where the people NEED to be exposed to the material at hand
Well it was a matter of phrasing so we ended up not disagreeing on anything, because he clarified. Also, Joseph backed me up in class and said what jay said was an example of his philosophical bullshit lol
How long until your parents leave you alone?
May I ask, where on the application do I have the opportunity to explain my grades?
Also what kinds of things do Rec letter writers need in terms of anecdotes
What's silly to me
Is that supposedly
College is more like the real world. No parents complaining. Rated R movies in class. People are expected to tolerate the adult worlds in its expanse. Why does this college feminist hypersensitive bs pop up there, then. It would make more sense in high school, or earlier. Of course, this is for practical reasons, but still it's so anachronistic, the protectionism
I bought an Audrey one (don't love it but whatever it's her), and Klimt, and of course your American Hustlw
Hustle
We are at a Best Western in... I think it's called West Greenwich, RI? It's legit halfway across the state from Brown, but everything else was booked because we started the hotel hunt too late. 
Last night's hotel exterior: 
We are 20 miles, 30 min from brown
I think you are selectively sensitive, as all are. Very sensitive about those you love, and not sensitive about those you dislike
The one with the video of the boobs, by the Chicanx
Idk how long :( I feel bad because tonight my dad was kinda being a dick to my mom and she was sad and I felt bad for leaving them in that state but I don't think it a general trend, I think everything is exacerbated by me leaving
My dad jokingly (but I think it reflects inner thoughts) offered me a new car to stay in Tucson
I'll look at the common app once I get out of the bath and give you an answer
You're in bath!!!
Sorry
Regarding letters, I of course could not read mine, so I cannot tell you really, but I gave my writers really dumb anecdotes
I see your messages as you send them and usually wait until you're done to reply
But bath excites me... :)
I think I was memorable enough in class that they came up with something. I would say the same is true for you
I could also bathe
Lol I am the same way. I usually wait but if you send something particularly inflammatory I immediately respond
My phone is about to die so I recommend haste
Can't really chat cos it's gonna die but I can send pics
Okay that would work too
Sry b
Actually
I'll take another later if desired
Yeah?
Actually it's late
Hmmmm
I could take one tomorrow... With video
I'll be alone during the day because of church so that's perfect
I'm in the bathroom already so i might as well jerk it
How do you feel about sending full on?
Full on
I don't have a mirror
Like opening your legs and sending one 
Oh you mean like?
I meant full on of 🌺
Ew ok
If that's what you want
Ew?!!
When I said full on in the past that's what I've always meant
Sorry if no response phone dying
Oh whoops
So hot
Please continue to send
Even if phone dies I'll get a nice surprise later
Wish it were in me
THAT WAS SO HOT
Hahahah a
Hi
Go
I didn't know what real life was until I asked for that frontal
I completely agree. Although college campuses have historically been proven to be some of the most liberal spaces, this modern-PC (I coined this phrase today 
Yes! Audrey! Might disrupt your masculine demeanor though.
during discussion) goes beyond anything rational. One of my main criticisms is how hypocritical it is for campuses to promote independent thinking and stuff, 
It looks almost Scandinavian
yet restrict the voice of knowledge. This protection is not protecting people from how their lives will be once they enter the workforce. There are no trigger 
I agree with your statement on my sensitivity 
warnings in the medical, legal, etc. field. I fear for this generation, and I am afraid to be a part of it.
I was almost sad to see you forgot to snap the picture of your hotel on the water
But thank you :) it's too lovely
Hahahah aha those boobs!!!!!!!!!!!'nnn omg that video was the shit, man
I need to make it look like I could believably be gay...
Fan o frontal?
How was your dad being a dick? :(
Don't "man" me
Lol you could've gotten a Benz and a shit degree!
I mean not really shit but compared to what you're getting anywhere else
He was giving my mom shit about buying another pair of pajama pants
(anywhere else you got accepted)
I'll check out the common app tomorrow, too late now
Are you serious about man-ing  you?
That's how I feel about you and buddy
You're right. Should I take the Benz? 
Buddy
My blood is curdling 
Fan o frontal?
You should've taken the Benz and then been the valedictorian at UA and gone to brown for free
You would've gotten undergrad and grad for free
Shit I should have thought of that
Anyway I feel bad for making you stay up later than you need to
Hahaha :)
No it's ok I am doing something right now. I need to be up for at least another 15
You would've had fun here for a few more years
Fan of frontal?
YES!!! The one where you were pulling it back made dicky go from 0-100
Like my cock got solid in a good .0000346 seconds
What're you up to?
Actually I still would be broke for med school, everyone gets debt, don't think there are scholarships. And bitch if I got valedictorian (again! (So bitchy)), I would choose Harvard this time 'round. I've learned. 
I'm looking at the schedule for tomorrow
What's on the schedule?
Lol well I'm glad that you are uncomfortable with a comfortable life and you strive for more
That's what working at savers has made me realize more than ever
Lol sienna is coming back to Tucson for the weekend
I'm glad she has the luxury of coming and going whenever she wants in a matter of like, 2.5 hours
Lol wow
That's actually pretty cool
But also expensive if it's a habit
Idk like not really anything
Just load in
:) back at you about the comfortable life thing
Anyway b
I do need to sleep so
Enjoy your evening
Enjoy the images
Enjoy!
I've thought so much about how awesome it would be if I went to any of the MA schools and I saw you on weekends
That would be really cool, but be sure that that isn't a consideration for you, I want you to choose a school for YOU not me. Apply everywhere that sounds cool!
Yes! And you enjoy your sleep and yourself and the company of your parents and the anticipation of starting college 😘
(To be fair New England is probably your best place regardless)
I've thought about whether or not you would say that to me at some point in this process
I assure you that I would like nothing more than to be there
Alright, I just want to be sure
Of course it would be great to have you nearby
:)
There's only one bed cos my mom forgot I was in their hotel tonight
We could rent hotel rooms and work on homework
So we are all on this king bed
Lol 2 broke 4 that
LOL nvm then about enjoying yourself and your sleep and your family 
We could go to the library and hang out in dorms when roommates are out
Almost everything I listed was undermined by that one bed thing
Yeah haha that's the cheaper and more practical alternative 
Find a way to enjoy it
It's not uncomfortable for me, really. This is super uncomfortable to admit, but I slept in a bed or in the room with my parents until like 14 or so. 
Don't mention that to anyone
My brother still does that
Richie
So why would I judge?
It's sweet how you had your mom tell you goodnight stories 
Whaaaaaat that just makes the whole shit kid thing more believable but also weirder
I think sleeping in the same bed facilitates a closeness that makes the kid feel like their parents will love them no matter what annoying shit they do
Personally I would find it uncomfortable but I can see why others still do it
Ya, when I left the bed, she read to me because I was scared and couldn't sleep without it
No I feel you
Anyway
For me all things tie back to sex and I feel uncomfortable with it because I wouldn't want to get a boner or have people get the wrong idea, etc.
🌚🌚🌚🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪 (a couple unusual flags seen on porches here on the journey these last 2 days. Many Sweden, one Polish, one Colombian) 
Not an issue for me :(
at least w boner
Goodnight!
I also have a list of places I saw confederate flags. I'll send later
Though it's skewed cos I payed the most attention and we drove near the most homes in PA
Well, if I would expect those flags (but Colombian? Strange) anywhere it would be the northeast due to proximity
And history
Hahaha I await your list, my love
Goodnight 😘🐢🌚
👋🏾📚🍑
I want your honest opinion about me saying man though
There's identity housing at Hampshire, which means gays and blacks and browns and women can house with people of their own identity
What's really cool is that the individual housing (called a mod) is basically an apartment where you and your fellow neighbors make rules for your little community
their dorms also sound appealing though. But fuckkkkk... I could have my own apartment, and if I want, a roommate too
 
I can't even get over the shitty photoshop job
I had a dream that I lent my computer to Dakota and some other basis people to photoshop something, and then I came back and it was mayhem, and Dakota's computer broke
It's 55 here now WHAT THE FUCK
I have never been so excited for 93 degrees, next week
Confederate Flags
Near Sarcoxie, MO
Near Edinboro, PA
Sheffield, PA
Near Galeton, PA
Gaines, PA
You can't say man because you're "boy" to me
Hey boy
Sup boy
See
Lol I wonder if the Hampshire housing is a secret plan for all the white males to live together and conspire to continue taking over the world while the women make a lot of useless noise about POC and other shit
We have three residential advisors
1. Regular
2. Minority focus
3. Woman focus
 That video was awesome
It made me want to transfer for no good reason
Lemme just say that I cannot say I had a similar experience in Amherst, MA. Seemed pretty boring
I had some crazy ass dream about you
I had a dream we had kids together, and you were out of the mansion and I was supposed to be giving them a bath. I forgot they were in the bath and when I went back hours later they were standing still in the shower (I could see them through the frosted glass)
In another dream you were visiting the Hampshire campus with me
I remember feeling wet because in another dream I fell into the river during a tour
There were a lot more dreams but I forgot them. Something about living in a secret community and when I hung out with black people past curfew, the curfew police came to patrol and I had to run back as fast as possible to check in to my quarters
Do you get a cool geotag on snapchat for Rhode Island?
That's such a weird one
are you prepared for the weather!!! 
Bloody hell
Of all places PA seems like the least likely to have the confederate flag flying around
That whole thing sickens me :/
Ok, you're right. The boy thing makes sense.
Lol, actually no white males are allowed to live together unless they submit a form for permanent housing
This is because all housing is either women-only or both genders
What was weird to me is that for a school with such progressive housing, when it comes to bathrooms the housing committee in each area chooses which genders can use the community's bathroom
When you were in Amherst did you do anything or go places?
What's awesome to me is that the Hampshire curriculum REQUIRES me to take classes at each of the other campuses for my division 1
Also, I could finish my undergrad in however much time I need
The admin suggests 4 years and break up divisions, but it's entirely up to me in the end
How are you feeling today?
Are you aware of PornHub's $25,000 scholarship?
You can text me now
Yes yes sorry I'm just unloading I'm a bit stressed
I'll text in a bit when I can
Aww :( okay
I hope everything gets better, I'm sorry
Hey I just got done so
Yeah
?
What's wrong?
No it just took forever
Parents irritating the fuck out of me
 Both genders doesn't mean each room has both genders 
And if most of the women do women only
Pretty sure women only means women only floors though
Not rooms
At each of the schools?!?
In Amherst we walked across town to UMass
Divisions?
I have heard of the scholarship
I am feeling alright, pretty neutral
Division 1:two semesters of taking courses on either Hampshire or the other college campuses and a minimum of 40 min campus-engaged learning
Division 2: I have professors on my committee and they advise me in internships, travel abroad, or more classes to help me focus on a concentration; multiple cultural perspectives project, and CEL learning part 2
Division 3: year long project, TA requirement, teach a class. Then I have to defend my final project.
This school is the perfect fit for me
Thank god seminar/research is my favorite class too because one of their essays is to write a self-evaluation of a favorite class
And I'm going to talk about how even though I was restrained by "immigration", I found ways to incorporate my interests and get the most out of the class blah blah blah critical thinking and 
I'm sorry about that :( why did they irritate you so much? Where are you headed now?
I thought you sent a pic of your dorm
Btw this is when I am home alone
Honestly the Hampshire requirements are not my cup of tea but I'm glad that they are yours 
Also, have you looked into the student populace? They seem quite a bit unlike you? But if this is the school for you, then great!
I'll tell you later what they said, I'm still mad
We went out to lunch, some east coast chain restaurant
Left campus cos it's so chaotic
I'll send a pic when I can
Why do you think they seem quite unlike me?
Raad was going to go to Hampshire if the UA wasn't so cheap
I mean Hampshire is like legit hippies
Though I know one girl who goes there and she's just a hardcore SJW
not a hippie
Did they make fun of you about something LGBTQQIA related
Was your roommate there yet?
It's raining here
What're you eating? I'm just now cooking my breakfast
Who is the girl? Joseph told me to ask his mom about it when I go over to his house
Did you know 25% of hampshire grads end up creating a non-profit, business, or other organization
Yes but you could have just said GT lol
Yeah he's alright
Regular smart straight boy
Likes rap
How do you know this already 
Tell me more about him
He looked super straight in his Facebook pics
Idk yet we haven't ordered yet, prolly just breakfast food
Her name is Anastasia Wrenn, of UHS
Idk we haven't talked much cos his parents were hounding
the convo was strictly business
How has your day been
He's one of THOSE types
No church!
I've been practicing my songs all morning and they sound so good
Also doing college research
I need to start getting my Harvey lines down
Lol we had a casual one-up AP talk which kinda sucked cos neither of us wanted it to go that way 
My mom kept apologizing for anything she's ever said regarding G to me all last night and this morning
When do you need it to be memorized
Do you not like the Hampshire girl?
She was nice but we didn't connect because she was all SJW all the time
Lol that's sooooooo pretentious and something I would expect to happen at Brown
I need it memorized by Tuesday :(
What the fuck
The play is in October haha
I'm in a lot of act 1
I have pages and pages of lines
"APs are my Olympics"
Omg, I hope your parents didn't make a GT comment in front of him or about you and him :(
No not in front of him
Ok well enjoy your lunch!
Sorry Yeah I'll text you when I'm out of here
It's Cracker Barrel
Which is southern and has a massive gift shop with candy n shit
It's like IHOP but better
They have cracker barrels in Arizona lol. I've been to those so many times.
Anyway, bye
In Tucson?
Yes
Whoa
Hey I can actually keep texting just at a slower rate
Has anything changed at home
I woke up at 6 but because I didn't want to be up with my family I stayed in bed for three hours until they left
This is really unhealthy
I feel guilty for not being able to communicate with them
My mom got upset that I didn't tell her the audition outcomes
We used to have family breakfasts at Cracker Barrel and Richie and I would fuck around in the gift shop, crying for the rattlesnake eggs or some magnets
also, I want to start reading books but whenever I actually have time it's already 11
What's weird to me is how you didn't have extensive communication with your roommate prior to meeting him
I expect to have long fb chats and shit
Tell them about what makes me uncomfortable and what I want out of a living space
What's his major?
Yesterday I managed to text you during dinner by telling my mom I was pulling up my list of colleges on the common app website lol
"It's like IHOP but better" what a disgrace
When I was younger my favorite line to say was, "you're nothing but a disgrace to this family" because I had heard it in a movie
Hahahaha, you could just not respond!
You don't think it beats IHOP?
I think making the comparison is a disgrace because it's obvious!!!
He's undecided but probably pre-med
I kinda don't want to be here. I imagine this is how Elizabeth and sienna get
Felt
Idk it's hard to make connections with new people that you know nothing about, at least for me
It will be better in time
Whoa there buddy, opened a snap of yours and it was full on balls from below with a bit of cock. That's a shocker
Nice tho
I've been so horny, I jerked twice yesterday 
Last night I fell asleep imagining my arms around you
The ones with your legs together are so cute!
I always felt that you had an inner desire to be the little spoon
How did you manage to open all of them
Well when all the people who surround you are ambitious and competitive as fuck, I can imagine it might be even more difficult 
Imagine that first opinion your roommate has of you after AP showdown
But yes, it will be better in time
I find it so easy to befriend people I know nothing about. I'm isually the one to ask bold questions
It was a desire out of curiosity because nobody had ever granted me the opportunity to be a little spoon
Although last night I missed being the big spoon so much
I could feel you pressing against my chest and you snuggling closer to me so I could have a tighter hold of you
When will you tell me what mom and pop said
Jennifer and Bella (in front of Joseph, who gives me looks about this) kept criticizing me for my commitment to you while you're gone, and said they don't understand why I still care so much when they know that once you get settled in college you're going to give no fucks about me
Back to back. Constant y'all
Bold questions like what?
Snuggling :(
Once I get back to the dorm I will
Joseph gave you looks?
They suck though. I just don't get it. 
People in RI are so pinkish
Punkish
It's normal to see butch lesbians, or gays or liberal hair styles 
So weird to me
When can we plan to skype a movie
Well I wasn't afraid to ask my 19 year old coworker about being pregnant
Or questions about how her family took it
That night brought us closer
Yes, he stays quiet and glances at me. I'm not sure if he agrees or feels bad or what, but he doesn't say anything.
Really?! I would have never expected that. What are some of the top bizarre styles you've seen?
Is the town hipsterish?
We can do it this weekend?
Lots of shaved sides of heads, boldly dyed hair
On people who aren't teens 
Don't have a feel for the town yet, but it doesn't seem so
Yeah what movie?
Dunno if I'll have time but we shall see
Prolly will have time
I have seen more obvious gays here in a few hours than months in Tucson 
So nothing over the top but
How hard is the rain? Pic?
Lots of shaved sides as I said
Lol isn't that exactly what you don't like?
What would that be like on 27+ year olds? I wonder../
Eh, some of them work it, others don't
What movie...
We could watch Brazil if that's alright with you?
The correct spelling is all right but that makes me uncomfortable 
Don't get any ideas about providence gays just yet...
The rain is lame lol but the clouds are intense as shit
What's up with you now? What happened after Cracker Barrel?
Hey I'm finally alone let's call
Brazil is good
What correct spelling lol?
Cloud pic?
Cracker Barrel was good, excuse you
Ufhhhhhh
What's up with you?
Did you find being alone depressing?
Can you talk on the phone in an hour?
What activities or events are there for freshman today?
Brazil would be lots of fun. Also I changed my schedule to go to Joseph's party lol
Lol I like Cracker Barrel too, what are you talking about?!
I didn't mean if you threw up or had to shit
I meant like what did you literally do
The correct spelling of alright is all right
Mr. Askira sounds sexy
I don't know when to use alright vs. all right anymore
I didn't find being alone depressing. I ironed
There is a mixer and some other stuff I think
Oh I thought you meant it was clearly inferior to IHOP
Never clarified bitch
I might be able to call around 745 my time
445 yours
Ok that's perfect!
I'm on lunch now so
Calling in a sec
 
Guess which side is mine
Bigger than it looks in pano
There's a huge Klimt the kiss wooden piece at savers!
What exactly is the unit meeting?
Lol your side is so neat and gay
It's easy to tell which is the straight boy side
Aww lily Allen played earlier. Remember when that was our thing? Thanks glee!
I hate when our time together is simply reduced to fucking, black crown, and movies by other people
My unit meeting was so long
Like 1.5 hours on... Not really all that much. Good icebreaker though
That is so reductionist!
Lily Allen <3
How did the rest of work go
I talked to a guy from San Francisco about food policy
Im so happy to be off from work
Because all the driving I've been doing to and from work (which is pretty much the only driving I do now that you're gone) I drive to get to places on time and I've gotten a lot worse
What was the ice breaker?
Did you have fun and meet new people?
Work was okay. I'm really happy I got to leave early
Lol #OnlyAtBrown
Btw I don't want you to feel obligated to call me because I want to hear you and stuff. If that's not your style then I'll respect that <3
What's up with food production in SF anyway?
Difficult because of drought, I presume
Wait so you're more late?
No, I'm home already
You had to say your name where you're from and one interesting fact. Which is generic but good 
What was your interesting fact?
I was in a Stephen king made-for-TV movie at 6, but you can't see me cos I'm blocked by a tree
You can go to someone's room if invited again
Starting now
It's incredibly unfair of me to restrain you in that sense, especially when we need to acknowledge the inevitable.
I'm sorry
No Sergio it's fine I totally understand
I would be upset with you too. I don't plan on it soon
My roommate is banging a chick right now...
What the fuck
It's just that I know in a matter of days, or even weeks, you certainly won't feel attached or "in love" with me
And idk
That's the inevitable
What's strange is how much sex doesn't matter for me. Like how much of a necessity it is not, but I understand for you and other people
So if you feel the need then I won't stop you
And the fact of the matter is that it will upset me no matter how long it is until you finally do it
Because it was so special for me and I couldn't imagine doing it with someone else, especially since you were the first person I'd ever been in
But that's okay if you want to do things. I understand.
Do what you need to do
It saddens me to even say this but it's ultimately your experience
I had been so good about not crying too
I feel terrible for suggesting we stay committed to each other
My phone is about to die but I want to talk. Sexile no charger. Will respond later:(
Don't worry about it
I love you 
I love you too
Hi
What's up with you now
A guy here visiting from west point sounds just like Taylor
I'm in my room now 
Lol why's he visiting?
I think to get with a girl cos that's not allowed at West Point, but she was busy tonight...
How's the party
Busy with someone else?
It's okay but I can still talk to you if you want to discuss the other thing
We are watching funny vines
Unknown. :O
Send some? I'll watch later
Look, I think it's going to be inevitable and painful for both of us regarding sex
I don't have an answer
though the fact remains that I really care for you
And it's hard for me, too, to imagine sex without you
Yeah haha I'll send them!!!!
I miss you and I hope you had a good time 😘😘😘
I understand, as long as we feel that way then I guess it'll happen how it does
How was socialization time
What did you all do
Lol we played spoons but we had no spoons so we used condoms
And Egyptian raff
And BS
wbu?
Lol you used condoms, clever
Did you win any?
Oh god not used condoms!
Jk
No I didn't lol
There is this guy that is so freaking gay and feminine that people think he is a trans guy not on T
(99.9999% sure he's just hella gay)
LOL
Omg that's so offensive??
YOU ARE A USED CONDOM!!!
there is a conference at Yale that was mentioned in the email tonight, but it's for pro-life activism 
that'd be such an insult
That trans thing is offensive
You are what you eat... Ewwwww
I know I was like "????"
And they were like "we should ask their pronouns"
That must've been an awkward moment
And I was like "????!?!?!?"
what the fuck
How accepting
lol one girl's fun fact was that her name was spelled like Caitlyn jenner's 
To be fair
Pro-life activism lol. What is the brown campus
They weren't judgmental
They just thought asking pronouns was the way to go
Lol I expect better from these people
This is not how I imagine the next lawyers of America 
I know :(
Anyway b
I will text you tomorrow!!!
I do need to sleep so
Okay hahaha!!!
Also I'm not actually offended
It's pretty funny tbh
What's funny?
🌚😘🌺
The Caitlyn Jenner thing
Oh hahaha
The other stuff is kinda questionable 
Goodnight! ❤️😘🍑🐢🐪
😛😛😛
Oscar sent me a snapchat saying "hey uh, I'm really drunk right now and I don't know what to do. I'm at ASU with my friends. Please send, uh--"
Ugh it was such a bad sleepover
What happened??
I felt very out of place and barely anyone was talking to me so I fell asleep and left first thing in the morning 
What's up with you?
:( that's awful
Which of your friends were there?
I'm heading out to meet up with my parents for food and a small amount of shopping
This morning I did some administrative stuff and watched another segment of The King and I
So looking at my schedule, Brazil would work best on sties day
Tuesday 
Is that possible?
It was the girls, and apparently before I got there they were talking about how upset they were about how I still talk to you.
So there was already that air in the room 
Well that sounds like fun. You should use all of the free time you have while you still have it.
Did your roommate ever come home?
It is possible but I wouldn't get home until 10pm your time
Or like 9:45
 Oh ok, we'll see then
He was in my room....
As in
I was kicked out for 3 hours
I don't get their obsession with the topic
So where did you go??
It's really just seems repetitive at this point
So they didn't engage with you?
I just went to play cards in the lounge, and go to the downstairs lounge to chat with people
 I wanted to sleep...
I'm surprised the girl stayed considering his mess
How inconsiderate
It's probably payback for the AP showdown 
All engaged with me except for Zayna, but it was still uncomfortable 
Aimee, I'm asking you this question only because I deeply care about you
You aren't worried about a gay insinuating that he wants to have sex with you and you go with him and he then refuses to do anything because of 🌺
Because I feel like college is the place for gays on the prowl for D
If they wanted 🌺 they could fuck a girl
You could already see how the flamboyant guy was singled out
I fear that one encounter might cause a campus-wide spread of knowledge, where everyone ends up finding out
This is another thing, I think your parents concerns are legitimate but I don't think they should've freaked out a bunch
However I do think you have a lot to consider
When someone sees you and finds you to be a potential sex candidate, you know what they want
In no way am I trying to discourage you
I hope you understand where I am coming from
I would expect you to have the same concerns for me
Sergio of course that's a massive concern
I really prefer not to be reminded of it
It's a big campus, nothing will happen, and I feel things out before starting anything
Ok, nvm then
With anyone
Ever
Like I always find a way to subtly ask
Ok
I'm not upset with you
For bringing it up
But it's an upsetting topic
But after all
You are gay
I mean it's possible, and bi people exist, and brown is very liberal (minus those people last night) regarding trans issues
And everyone is drunk a lot
I've known about it for years though
And people experiment
I knew exactly what I was doing with myself
And I was already very interested in you
But ok
Can I ask you something honestly
Are you bringing this up because you are hurt
Yes
And trying to discourage me from pursuing anything
Because I think you knew that I knew this and that it was painful to me
I could understand how it may come off that way, but it is actually one of my biggest concerns because I know for a fact that you're going to pursue sex no matter what
 being hurt will not stop you whatsoever
I might as well not let two people get hurt in the process
I really don't believe you
But ok
That probably could've been why it came to mind
At this exact moment
Benefit of the doubt, I'm glad you care to prevent me from being hurt
But logically that wasn't my thought process
I didn't do it out of hurt
And I kinda knew that you knew this but you never acknowledged it
Ok wow, fuck you
No it's ok
Seriously 
Really I respect you for trying to help me out
I'll get over it
Why does this upset you
What upset you right now
It's like when I reminded you of how people had thought of you as a pervert, and some hadn't moved on from that.
You laughed about it...
There's a difference
I don't think you would be happy to talk about it regardless
When your shortcomings are brought up it makes you wince
And these aren't even in my control at all
You're right, okay.
I'm sorry and I shouldn't have brought it up. Have a good day.
I'll text you in a bit, to let things calm down and let me get breakfast. :)
Enjoy your breakfast
I have so much love for you
Did you see the girl leaving your dorm haha or did you just come back and she was gone and the door was unlocked?
Did he say anything about it in the morning?
How does pro-life activism work on a college campus
It's a minority against everyone else lol
I wonder if people ever change their minds after rallies 
Also I dislike how these days everything is strictly split into right and wrong sides
Are you thinking of doing sports?
Hi just finished breakfast
No I just didn't know what to do cos we didn't have a signal so I just waited a long time until I figured it was unreasonable that he would still be with her
So now we have a signal
He alluded to it when we talked about the signal but no explicit discussion or acknowledgment at all
So you agree that left is wrong! "There's right and wrong"
Prolly not sports, maybe gym
I feel like pro-life is problematic here
ALSO
my head RA is an Asian named Josiah and he is head of the Christian literary magazine
Punk haircut
It's a funny combination
What'd you eat? What's the brown food like?
Lol so what is your signal?
You always think of doing things in your dorm but you never think about the other person
This is fascinating
Hahahah there's are wrongs with both sides
Josiah is such a religious name. It's weird for me to imagine religious (Christian/Mormon mainly) Asians
Do you ever wonder about what each person said on their application to get into brown? 
Like what their stories are?
What does your course schedule look like?
If I may ask, what are some things you want from me over this year?
I ask this because you are usually the grounded one and I am willing to follow
Javier, Oscar, and nico are going to Joseph's thing
It's like gay Mexico
I thought Joseph's was yesterday
How did this party become so massive
Oh I went out to breakfast 
In Pawtucket, RI
At a place like bobo's
Our signal is something on the door and a sleeping bag of it's gonna be a while
I do wonder a bit, some people I am really surprised that they are all that smart to get in. They just don't seem it
I'll kill that question over
Mull
How does the day look for you
Lol you thought Joseph's was Friday and yesterday
I have to get alcohol for him
Carly and her junior/sophomore friends haha.
A sleeping bag???
Why did you kill the question lol? I'm serious in a very non-sentimental way.
I work later and do homework. That's pretty much it. I'm relaxing now. Wbu?
What happened to courses?
Or do you not choose yet?
Yeah so that the sexiled can sleep somewhere else
I meant to say mull lol not kill
I chose them but for some reason you need to later register officially? Idk
I have a long laundry list of mandatory events
The guy from West Point knew and was distantly related to Ariana rocha
Do you want to know when I have sex for the first time? Sexiled is such a great word, btw. It sounds ancient, like if you steal bread then you must remain abstinent.
Lol, which classes did you take? No gen eds, right?
*choose to take
What are some of the mandatory events? I'm sure they'll be fun since it's the first week and brown doesn't want to scare any students away haha
I'll never forget that graduation speech where the West Point guy was like, "I'll bet money that this girl is gonna go on to win a medal at the Olympics!!" and then the girl I talked to at TVF said, "she isn't even that good..."
Are you excited for your day!!!
Lol they aren't fun. The fun ones are option
Optional
Engaging diversity, a sex assault seminar, an alcohol seminar
Omg let's hope you don't watch those shitty animated videos
Alcohol seminar
Idk the pint
Sorry I was distracted
Listen to this song
The seminar
Was a roller coaster
I'll check it out when I get back!
Don't you hate it when you want to ask someone if they know a song over text and all you can type is "ooooh oooh oh ohhh"
The manager at savers in charge of scheduling referred to herself as a businesswoman... Lol
How was it a roller coaster? Haha
Goodnight
Hi
I'm up
I've just been at mandatory meetings til now
Yes :( that happens to me constantly
Bahahahha "business majors"
Well they were like "don't do it" but it's ok but it's bad but there are options 
How was your day eventually??
What's sad is how they assume you're used to being up late since you're teenagers 
So mandatory meetings end at midnight
Lights out is probably 3 am
The best thing to do would be to warn you of the dangers and leave it at that
Eh, I lack motivation these days and I blame the job.
I am upset the entire time
I am forced to smile at every customer regardless of my feelings
I interact with at least a hundred different people and I handle various payment method materials
Everything feels mechanical
The people are what make it fun, although manny is the definition of flirty
It actually ends at 1:30 
I'm just walking between them
And I have one at 9AM
He tasers me
With what!
That thing where you push your fingers into the love handles
?
Let's call tomorrow
That's terrible
Your gonna get so wrecked this year
Sleep wise
Well have fun. See ya
Tell me how your day goes later
You don't have love handles though
Will do :(
I'm gonna be less busy after these orientation schools I swear
I feel just as bad about the poor communication
I miss you very much, and have so much to share with you, I hope you have as much to share with me
😍
Don't worry about it 😘 I hope you're not falling asleep at these things haha
I miss you so much too and I will send you lots of music to listen to and pictures to see
Maybe we can rent one of these jenai vans when you come back and travel the United States lol
It looks kinda like a lab
Anyway, let me know when you're going to sleep ❤️
Interesting how the black girls are supposedly sexually superior to white guys: 
Flawless transitions!!!! Gives Disney a mature jazz feel where I imagine eating lobster in Spain with my soulmate
Lol I wonder how many people in our school this will be 
No Type by Rae Sremmurd is actually such a great pump up song
Listen to Ginza by J Balvin
"There are worse things I could do" Grease c.c. Productions
Oh sorry, that was my sleep notification last night :O
Listening to all dis
I'll be free 1ish- 9 today so that's good
That is good!!
I probably had one of the best dreams ever. In college had a secret boyfriend who was a vampire, so we had to wait until everyone was already asleep to get out of the dorm room. He could fly so he took me up into the sky and we flew around while holding each other, seeing the world. Then when we got to our destination in the woods, we had to fly back down and run into the woods to follow a light. I thought the flashes of light was a signal from our ancestors, but it turned out there it was savers in the woods and we had to help set up the store.
The dream made me feel like I was in a plane, but comfortable
Have a great day!!!
I am a bit worried because all of my dreams last night tied back to savers.
Have your parents left yet?
This is practical to a disturbing degree...
That sounds like a dream turned crappy
Like savers ;/
No, we are going around RI in like an hour
To Newport, which is an island!
 Can I call
Not a fan of no type, so repetitive. Maybe it will grow on me
That is the most fucked up thing
This is what happens when laws dictate morality. That because it's more convenient in terms of victim compensation to kill, they do it. I wonder how common this is
What's up
Hey
It was probably because of all the musicals I listened to as I fell asleep
The suspenseful music made it go sour
Haha I saw Newport when I was looking at the map of Rhode Island
Sorry I wasn't checking my phone because I thought you wouldn't be able to talk
Tell me how it goes
Do you go by ferry?
I have things to share with you when you're able to talk! 
Oscar drunk texted me
Sorry b it's too late no :(
Now
We can chat later though, probably
We ended up just going to chipotle lol
Not enough time
I don't like it here so far. I think I would feel the same anywhere though
What did he say
That boy is a horndog
But no you can drive there via bridge
Lol that's so sad. Do you take the bus around, or how to you get around town?
What specifically do you not like about it?
I feel the opposite. There are some places that you just connect with, you know? I know for a fact that I wouldn't mind living in Maryland. D.C. though... That's a different story. It's a lively city but I couldn't live there
I hope you're having a good day 💕
 
It was really weird
I ate Panda Express for lunch and I feel sick
I can't wait to talk to you!!!!
Got this at savers for $11 with my employee discount. Originally $36
My facial hair has been growing in faster and because I'm carrying heavy merchandise and pushing racks all day my arms are sore, and surprisingly bigger
I'm going to New York for sure in November
Hey b! That's so pretty! I'm still at events, I'll call you around 9:30 your time
Okay :)
Lol in the Cell Block Tango 1997 Chicago Broadway Cast Recording, the girl who gets with the Mormon is black
Listen to Tonight from the 2009 West Side Story Broadway cast recording
I'm still out, but still gonna call when done
You don't need to if you're tired
I don't work during the week
No, I want to talk to you
I want to commit to doing that
Okay, are you busy now?
Let me know when you are about to call
Obviously, I am going to be up for a couple more hours
I'll let you know
Calling now
Ok?
What the fuck
No
It's like, 2 am over there
Oh ok sorry
Yeah
Go to sleep
We all chatted about racism
It's ok 
Lol
I'm glad you enjoyed your time
So no? :(
I'm really ok
I want to but you also need to wake up early
No no
?
🌚🐢😘
I really needed that. Talking to you and hearing your voice is like mental masturbation.
See ya straight boy :P
Have a great day!!!
You too!
Lol one of the boys said "no one suspects cos you have the deep voice" and in my head I was like "me? Deep voice?"
frankly, you sound like you could be a late bloomer
What do you mean
You're very straight acting under certain circumstances 
Also your laugh is so deep
You have a straight laugh, as I like to call it
Then you have your laugh that you do when you're with me
Idk how to describe it really
Who knows you're gay?
The two gays and woody Allen
But what do you mean late bloomer
Also, ok, I have stories for you but they're stupid as fuck but I guess I'll tell you one anyway
Please do!
Two days ago I was opening at savers and there was a long line outside of the store. Apparently an elderly lady needed to take a shit (diarrhea) and kept asking if she could come into the store. The fat ass bitch manager, Kyla, said no she can't because of money violations, and that if she needed to use the restroom "she should have a diaper"
Then the old lady said that was an ADA violation and that she submitted her treatment to channel 4 and called the manager a fat bitch
And like customers are so fucking rude
Although in that case I think the manager is a bitch. That was when she said "as a businesswoman, don't you think I would know about violations?! I swear, this job stresses me out"
I saw a guy who looks like a male poussey with a stubbly beard
Lol, that's bitchy on all sides
Don't think it violated ADA
And I was helping a man out at jewelry and I asked him if the two watches in his hand were his, and he said "EXCUSE ME, DID YOU TAKE THE WATCH OUT FOR ME?! IF THIS WERE A COURT OF LAW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THE WATCH? ITS MINE"
Other rude customer stories?
I also got my first stoner customer who didn't care about anything and wasn't listening to me at all
I met a 20-something year old guy teaching computer science at pueblo high school
Customers sometimes ask for "the cute one" which is me :)
I get compliments about my teeth and eyebrows (???)
I saw a lovely interaction between two elderly women. Only one of them could speak English but they were making jokes together in line with the little English the other lady knew, and it warmed my heart to see such accepting people
Late bloomer like your voice sounds kinda childish in a deep way
Imaging 15
Imagine
Lol really? For some reason the poussey face is common
What's weird to me is seeing fat chola lesbians with their families. I wonder what the story is
We get a lot of lesbians and trans people
Ok but also I hate the fat bitch
Are you sure he wasn't on something worse?
Lol I didn't know they have computer science
Mr J thrifts a lot. For some reason it attracts those people. I think the obvious lesbians and trans people (especially of color) are often very low income
It weird to me to imagine how one becomes a chola lesbian
There is one black lesbian at brown who looks like lil Wayne
And she seems lonely
How fat is she
I'm the only one in class because I didn't sign up for the UA presentation
The Chinese teacher asked me questions about my life
Lol yeah! Apparently it's a new program to get the kids ahead. They learn coding and programming and make their own games, it's pretty good. I asked him if it was expensive and he said they only pay for the software and it's worth it.
Well I suppose Mr. J is for the cheap props and costumes, but that's also what I thought. It's less discomforting than a mall, and way cheaper.
"How one becomes a chola lesbian"
She was like Casey but short and with basketball shorts 
Been trying to nap but I can't stop thinking about us facing each other nude and you touching my wet spot with your cock
Yeah but like at what age is it like "I wanna slick back my hair and let go of myself"?
Zayna exiled me from the room where we spend our free period so I am outside on the east staircase
I am so upset
Today I brushed against Madeleine in class and fell back against her to feel her warmth and I imagined it was you
It was so nostalgic
I miss you a lot
"Slick back my hair" omg
Remember Gloria's 6th grade pics? I imagine that's what she would've become if she didn't maintain her weight and like boys
What's up now?
What've you been up to today?
I'm literally just sitting outside eating my lunch during my free period.
I just got out of convocation
Which is where you walk through the gates if you see my Snapchat story
The problem was that we were standing in line and it was like a mile long in the humid heat for half an hour and then sitting for half an hour
Actually more like an hour and a half
Why are you upset
I visited a state park in Lincoln, Rhode Island they had a lake and fish and trees with leaves slowly changing
And they also had a beach and kayaks and horses
Now I'm about to go get dinner and then register finally for courses
I need right now right now I'm taking a shower because I'm so sweaty
an*
Madeline is the worst person for that fantasy to occur
Lol Sergio
This chick tried to come onto me hardcore
But she was like a super intense person
"I'm so mad I can't take 5 classes!!!" 
She's cool tho, it was just funny
#powerofsweatpants
I can't believe brown has been here for over a quarter millennium
4th time I've turned down probable sex this week
Can't believe how forward people are
❤️❤️❤️
Is that where you're officially a student or start the year!
?
Lol it's so humid here too. Do all undergrads walk through the gate?
I'm upset because of how immature she is with all of this ignoring business.
Today I dedicated three hours to college research and essay writing, and I got a perfect anecdote
I'll have to send it to you
Did you get to put your hands in the water? That's sounds delightful.
I told joseph about how I craved your touch and he was like, "what about that other gay gay!! (Oscar)"
Yes though, it was awkward for that to happen with Madeleine
Lol how many classes is she taking? Which ones did you sign up for!!!
Do you look good in sweats with sock?
Ya! Officially a student now
No sock
Well I signed up for some but it's a complicated system. Basically I signed up for some I was interested in that had limited spaces, only because otherwise I had no chance. Most of the classes I want are unlimited though, so I signed up for some I don't care for
Like the history of blacks in New Orleans 
Yes the line was a mile long
Why would Joseph say that
What was your essay? Send pls
She is taking 4 I think, don't recall which. One was evolution of plant diversity she was pumped for cos of field trips
Brown quote of the day
Trivia question: if extended to 5 dimensions a black hole becomes a black what?
"3D: singularity 4D: line 5D: Square??" And then the answer was string and everyone was like "ohhhhh of course" and I thought they were serious
250 years?!!!! Shit
Are the more selective spots for classes with a smaller size?
Lol I didn't know that class was relevant to your major
Or interested you
Sorry, the major comment was stupid
I don't know why Joseph said that, but it wasn't really the appropriate response
I'm writing an essay for vassar but it's probably the worst thing I've ever written
Lol what's awesome is how field trips are going to be a primary part of your college experience. 
I am looking forward to that
I'm at pionic pizza now, the subway of pizza making
?
I don't get the trivia question
Also I am now applying to the Claremont schools
Today when I got upset joseph came up to me and squeezed my shoulder and told me he would always be there for me, even if I'm not his first choice for telling things to
And I cried a bit 
The line I loved from my personal statement. Not the first part as much, but the last part:
"My grandfather frequently drove me to the hospital so I could watch lifetime movies in her hospital room, sometimes doing my class work; or watching over her as she fell asleep during the movies (like she always does). We munched on mediocre hospital cafeteria food, imagining the stale burger buns and dry lettuce were part of a five course meal to appease her stay.
*no semi colon in there
Ok goodnight
Hi
I just got back
Yes, the smaller classes are harder to get into, but most are first-come first-serve
Send me the essays?
My peer advisor really pushed me to take a diverse range of classes, I'm trying things out. I think I'll try to do much of my pre-med requirements back at home over the summer
Is picnic good? I don't even want unique topping combinations
Pionic
I don't get the trivia either
honestly Sergio
I don't get why he would say that to you. He has been so insensitive
At least in some respects
I hope he and I talk this through when I'm back
Appease her stay? I don't understand
Make her feel better about the stay
I think it's because of what the group feeds him. He has been spending a lot of time with them recently.
Right now I'm writing anecdotes for rec letters and one of my lines is how while some find comfort in a cigarette, I find comfort in the theaters or arthouses 
Today Keizer and vina called me "the closest thing basis has to a counselor" because I listen to their problems and I have helped them through difficult times 
How can you do them at home?
Where were you just now?
Pionic is good. They're not unique combinations, but the catch is that you can have unlimited toppings for free, which is rare these Faust
Days
Fucked up quote of the day
Nathaniel and Sergio talking about how horny Sergio is
Nathaniel: I don't want you to get too rapey
Sergio: it's not rapey if you convince them they want it
Omg Sergio
The gayest boy on my floor who is apparently not gay (impossible, you should see him) told about Lana del Rey today, as a person, and he totally believes her songs are 100% autobiographical 
Like
That she was in a biker gang and a stripper and killed a racist
rapist
Maybe he just really hated me
He emailed me today in response to some spotify shenanigans and seemed nice bough
Enough
I so agree with their assessment
Both vina and Keizer came out to me
University of Arizona, though I don't know what the cost would be
What is Vina?
I played a card game called presidents and then walked around other dorms to see what it's like there
One dorm was playing a song about anal for Jesus
And then discussing the morality of minion genocide
How expensive is pionic
"Fuck me in the ass because I love Jesus. The good lord would want it that way. It's the sweet sensation of a throbbing rationalization"
Sometimes I think about all the things they say you should not do because of consent issues and we have broken like 100% of them
Like sitting in the rooms I feel out of place a bit
Because everyone agrees that having sex with a sleeping person is bad but I think it's hot. They didn't leave room for kink
Lol that boy is probably just fucked up if he thinks you're dumb enough to believe any famous pop song these days is entirely autobiographical 
What is the Jesus anal song called
Well
I feel like addressing your issues to him about this is unnecessary, although he probably thinks the comments are helping me.
He didn't say it was from the lyrics he presented it as biographical fact too
Vina is bi I think? She has a girlfriend in Ohio 
I inferred he got it from lyrics, because there was no documentation of any of this
The morality of minion genocide would be interesting to discuss
That's a huge problem for me
He has for a long time been a good friend of mine and I think that it is important
I fucking hate their squeaky ass voices and goggles and I don't even know who birthed those immortal motherfuckers and how they haven't been squished to death yet
That's a song I recall Zoe singing in 8th grade
It's called Fuck  in the Ass Because I love Jesus
Pionic is $7.99 for a large personal pizza. I was really full.
Jennifer and I spent our entire night together
We went to the farm and got dinner and talked for hours
Lol yeah, or giving head while the other person is passed out (guilty)
Passed out rimjobs
The only objectionable thing  about Lana is the way she glorifies chola cartel life, even though she is scared as shit to hang out in the ghetto
How are you feeling?
Jennifer kinda taught me how to belt notes
Anyway I feel bad for keeping you up
Chola? She is white though 
I'm feeling tired, so I feel 
Sounds like you had a great great night!
Hey maybe tomorrow morning we could do a pics thing?
Gonna be alone finally
Anyway goodnight 😀
Lol tonight was supposed to be Brazil night 
FUCK 
I need to start putting this on my calendar I'm sorry
Things move so quickly here
No no, I figured you forgot so I found other things to pass the time
I swear we'll find time soon
You should have mentioned it though because
I was bored and looking for shit to do all night
That's why I sent the ?
I didn't want to bother you if you were doing something productive 
Anyway, it's fine
No no I wasn't 
Seriously not even close
Sorry I didn't know what the ? ant
Alright 
Alright
😘
Goodnight
No pics? :(
Oh you didn't respond
So I figure you didn't want it
Lol we've had this "not responding didn't think you wanted to" thing
That's ok
Although when have I ever turned that down??
Anyway, have a good one
I feel like saying that kind of thing makes you resentful
I scored points with Sonja for working at savers
Well I'm sorry
I didn't think you wanted pictures so I'm already out of the shower, but feel free to send
Yesterday Oscar sent me snapchats from his classes with the class name, and a lot of them are 101s
Sorry, the reason I get excited to text you in the morning is because it's usually a nice way to start my morning and I don't feel bad for not talking to you and stuff
It's also a lot of the free time I get where I can send things like snaps
Even though that's probably not the exact reason why it was invented 
Are you still alone?
Just got out of class but I think Alex is back. I'll see once I get to the room
Redbull left a crate full of different flavors of Redbull on the green that you can just take
Some marketing thing
Do you start at 8:30
I'm alone now
Yes, 8:30
Really? That sounds terrible, but it's a great connection
What a bad incentive for students
What class did you come out of?
The evolution and ecology of infectious disease
Lol I took 12 so I'm happy
Ok I'll send some stuff
Last video has noise 
I could've been in school now but these are the things I do for you
Today was only syllabus though?
Is roomie out?
He's out
Also do you ever check people's stories?
Oh go to school b
Don't skip schools for me lol
Mm from time to time
Yeah it was syllabus 
He was like "we might have some algebra" *proceeds to do stuff from calc AB*
Will send more pics in a bit
Just wanna go through yours
Tell me what to think :)
Lol seriously?! I miss calc though, game theory sucks
Shit I came so fast
Haven't done that in a week
I loooooved the pic of you with your legs spread taking a pic of your semi
Having not seen one in like... 2 weeks? The mystique of the cock has returned
I can understand the no porn thing now
Can you listen to On My Own from les mis 1987
Heard it a million times
I'm happy for you. Was it satisfying?
The class I first went to is capped at like 25% As and I'm the only first year. I think I might delay to next year
Very satisfying 
I felt that I didn't need all that much in order to be very turned on
You haven't had time to jerk or watch porn?
That makes me feel so loved in a different way
Like hearing sweet things and feeling desired are two different loved feelings 
How are you today?
TA
Ok so the rule is we can't sleep with the same person more than 2 or 3 times, right?
What
Isn't there a flaw in this method because of my location
I haven't had any time alone to do those things actually
Lol I knew that would get your attention
I had an up and down day with classes. We will see. I'll tell you about it over the phone whenever
Actually
You know it was a coincidence
I JUST got back from a class
With a strict no texting policy (not like I would anyway)
I'm out with Diviya and Nate
Ok yes, you need to let me know about it. Today Reyna and I are doing spark root and SAAF WIW
Are you done with classes for the day?
Do you think you can handle the year?
The macalester rep came today and I have to tell you about it
I think we have slowly become great candidates for an open relationship 
As opposed to how I felt about it a year ago
DAMN SON
Killin' those college campus lawns
It is absurd
And I am so sweaty from the humidity
In brief really liked archaeology class but it conflicts with other courses, also liked plant class with old British professor. Infectious disease class seemed very interesting but I will probably take it next year instead because I am the only first year and he made it so that only the top 25% of students get an A, so it is EXTREMELY competitive and I don't need that right now
I have a politics class at 6:30
I can handle it easily if I choose classes wisely. Really doesn't seem like so much work with what I have so far
Tell me about Mac
I feel you on the open
CVS milk made me sick
Reyna and nina's brother helped me parallel park for the first time
Plant class? Fascinating! I think this year is perfect for you to test the waters and see what you can handle
How was politics?
What are all your classes so far? You won't have an end of the year project
Macalester was so underwhelming because I know the school has a lot of opportunity, yet the rep seemed apathetic and bored
He kept saying "we are liberal arts and that's all you need to know"
Ok Have a good day
Hi I just got back
Was the rep white
Politics was awful
She seemed super frazzled
Ranted about government shutdown for 5 minutes
And cancelled the class for the next week and left 10 minutes in
I had the plants, infectious disease, archaeology and politics
What's up today
Yes he was white and fat
Really haha?! That seems like a class that requires a neutral teacher who will be objective 
You know?
Like that's a very risky, difficult class to teach
Why did she cancel the class though?! Isn't that unprofessional?
I'm at SAAF now
Ok obviously I'm not there anymore but it was a great time
Your ass is so nice and bubbly :(
You barely sent any!
Alright well goodnight
Do you think you've changed in your motivations and/or way you've cared for me or viewed me in the past few weeks?
Do you ever feel like there were times in our relationship when you didn't care for me or placed others above me, and felt chained down by me!
I feel that in the past there has been a lot of toxicity, dealt with either through tears at a party or reticence.
Do you feel that a lot of it was instigated by me?
Also, I would appreciate if you acknowledged this, because I feel that you often dismiss a lot of my reflective questions and treat them without seriousness
Like you think I'm trying to be manipulative or make you sad or something
I only ask because I care for you, I want to maintain a relationship with you, and I feel that addressing past mistakes is an effective way to progress (together or not)
I missed you today. I felt like you were more settled, and as a result gone.
It was lonely 
I still love you very much and I hope your feelings for me haven't changed
Sorry b I was asleep :(((
Hahah don't worry
❤️❤️❤️
Yes it's super unprofessional
I'm gonna go one more time to see if it changes but I'll probably drop the class
I'm sorry I didn't send much I was in a bit of a rush :(
I think that your central role in my life has become somewhat diminished over the past couple of weeks because you are not now at the center of everything I do 
I don't feel that I placed others above you, though I do feel that at times I didn't put you far above others. I felt that our time alone was our time, but that in groups I didn't have any obligation to treat you above others. Which I suppose could seem like Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like I would revert to my cynicism and critical manner when in groups with you, something you aren't used to from me
And I think, something that you don't function well with because you depend heavily on empathy as a complement to argument and reasoning
To me, that wasn't toxicity, I can see how it would be for you
Also I don't like the word toxicity
My feelings for you haven't changed, in fact I long for the understanding and acceptance we had
That I fear I might not find here for a long long long long time
And moreover I love that duck
Omg Sergio the prince pic
Prince pic
Insta
Ah yes thank you
What's up
Idk I feel bad today for no specific reason for talking to you
Like you have better things to do
And I should give you space
Which may not be the case, but understand where I'm coming from
I come from Tucson, my sole home, that is segregated. There is South Tucson and everywhere else.
Lol
Jk
Recently I've been annoying
Probably an anxiety thing 
It's so difficult not to judge the people from a country with fucked up news and politics
What's up with you
 At the club fair. I'll chat in a bit
 It's what keeps me sane
Heading back now what's up with you
How has your week been
How have classes been
What keeps you sane?
Did any clubs pique your interest?
You. OMG I had the worst homework today
It took me an hour to have to read three pages
An hour and a half*
Stupid dictation 
Nothing stood out, but I joined the interest list for a lot. Including Challah for Hunger
For some reason I've gotten super hard today thinking of fucking a girl
you could fuck Reyna
Jk
I napped for a good 20 minutes and just woke up
I want to send you pics
Classes have been so stressful. I feel consumed by deadlines 
I changed my SRP project today from antisemitism on college campuses to trans youth
Homelessness
Idk maybe I'm just too horny
It probably doesn't mean anything
Lol seriously?! I'm so sorry :/ was it because the assignment was dense or was it just because you had difficulty reading it?
What's challah for hunger?
I now understand the wrath of Zayna and how alienating it felt for you last year, because she is doing the same thing to me
Can you please send me pictures of your ass
Whenever you get the chance this week
Fuck I miss u
Send me pics! 
I feel consumed by deadlines too
I'll send when I can, but I can't now
No I want to see you!
Why that topic? 
Sounds great though
It's both of those things. It's long and hard, like your cock
They make challah and sell it and give the money to local non profits who deal with hunger
What is she doing to you, and how do you feel
What are your deadlines? For me, I have a lot of essays (applying to 18 schools) and my Boy Scout project and work and TVF obligations. Also drama stuff :(
What's up with you now?
What did you do today?
That topic because I have a connection to the rejection of identity and how isolating it can feel, and I want to go into the resources available to them and what people are doing to help and what incentives are in place for their progression 
Also we are in a unique place because of our liberal city in a conservative state, and there is legislature on this sort of issue
What class was the reading for? You're awful, tempting me that way :P
I hear challah and I thought of the bread, so I looked it up just in case and now I feel like I should be awarded honorary jew points and like all those kosher meals I received were rightfully ordered for me
She has cut all communication with me and it's only Bella and Jennifer talking to me, however I feel like they are heavily linked to Zayna and things are likely to change
"Seriously though. Even in this moment. Zayna was just telling me how hard it is to not talk to you. You have the choice even now between friends who really love you (even though it may not feel like it right now. But I swear they are only doing this because by loving you, your actions became unbearable) and would love to be in your life for years and years and even now, every day
Or a guy who has treated you like shit in the past who just recently started being sweet who will probably find some new guy in a few months."
I've been eating with different people every day though. Yesterday was Nate and Diviya and today was Martha, Madeleine, and Keizer 
Reyna and I hung out after school like old times. We went to cartel, del taco, and SAAF
I meant to say two groups of people but whatever 
I had to read two papers for my infectious disease class and write a paragraph of response (took 4 hours so far) for Monday, then I need to read a chapter from the plants book for Monday , and 100 pages for a history class  for next Friday, and a chapter for archaeology
Oh shit the archaeology is due tomorrow 
Oh well don't have the book whoops
Don't think I'm gonna take that class anyway, it is full 
You know 
That's actually very power wheel, what they are doing
Really, it's manipulative as fuck
These recent actions have shown me a different side of Zayna that has made me okay with losing her, because this was entirely her idea.
People have no right to mandate who I maintain ties with
And today she tried talking to me but I dismissed her like a motherfucker because I don't have the energy or time
I am actually so done
I can't understand what must go through someone's head for them to think that a tactic like this could be beneficial 
Are you prepared for when the classes become a lot more difficult? What's scary is how this is only the beginning
How many people makes it full? What do you think you'll take instead?
:)
I think I'll become faster
That class is 50, because the room isn't big
I'll probably take a stupid politics class that sucks because I don't have options
Can I cal
Call
Yeah lol
Hey I can't call because we aren't supposed to be on phones while walked alone at night because you are distracted and likely to get mugged :(
So I'll call tomorrow or something
That's fine
I figured as much anyway
You would be tired and worn out, unable to even carry a backpack
Lol I've seen that before. True though
I gagged and still blew you in the following weeks after almost choking on your penis. You could have just killed me to benefit your dick. Still, that would limit future bjs and might not be in your best interest 
My beautiful perspective
Makes up for the time you refused to blow me in the hotel room when you had a cold, humph!
What's scary to know is how fragile humans are
Spooky dick, death by dick
Trippin' over dick too hard, falls down flight of stairs
dick dick dick sick rick bitch
What am I doing with my time, and moreover, my life?
Joining Peace Corps! That's what!
I love the peace corps graduate program
I can honestly say that here I don't even have enough time to eat 
I am almost continuously hungry
You actually want to fuck a girl?
Peace corps sound perfect for you
I think I'm missing your 🌺 too much
Although today when I was fantasizing I thought of a girl and boobs
I thought about your convenience and then an imaginary girl popped into my head 
What's the food like at the cafeteria?
I know I ask this question a lot but
Do you not eat enough or something?
Do you ever consider that you
might be somewhat bisexual
Never could date a girl, would have sex with a stranger
Still
Female stranger
Homoromantic bisexual is a thing
I refuse to be labeled!!!!!!!
The food is so-so but mostly I just don't have the time in the day to walk over and get food
I have had like 0 free time today
I haven't gone on the Internet
I haven't done shit
Whoa there sorry bud
All I know is that I'm kinda afraid of dick and i want to have sex with a girl in college
But I love men so much
There's like 5 brown groups for Israel and none for Palestine
I was told brown was liberal
Did you fear dick with Shawn or Anthony
I couldn't imagine my future life without a male companion 
Sergio by the way
Yes?
I realized after my reading in captivity today
Ahhh you had sex
Oh lol
That I was being kinda a jackass
Like I disregarded your feelings, I made them seem irrational, It's fucked up, and I'm sorry. 
No free time?? I'm sorry 😕 that's actually really terrible
What concerns me, like I've said before, is how it's like this at only the beginning
I fear months from now
Lol they're making up for the fact that there used to be quotas on Jewish application acceptances 
In the text they described it as undermining the fundamental desire of confirmation of belief. Also that I made what you said seem absurd. Given, I didn't isolate you or do anything else like that so I don't think it's psychological captivity lol but I do recognize that it's deeply discompassionate
I didn't fear dick once I started touching it
Like in flesh it was nice
Which feelings? From this morning?
And that it undermines your ability of free thought and manipulated it and could lead to questions of self-worth
No no
Just in the past in general
I think it will actually be better in time when I know what to expect from the classes
Yeah...
Get in the groove
I never feared dick
But I fell in love with it the second I touched it
As much as I loved you there was always an underlying feeling of unworthiness 
And I think as a result, that's what led to my "breaks"
I felt like you didn't value me and my mind
That says a lot about Reza lol
And the funny thing is that I always did value your strength, and optimism, and ability to persist and grow
Not so much your emotional outpourings but I see that that was only deepened by my dismissal thereof
Reza "pretty cock" Satari
See, I thought you despised those things and favored practicality instead
That IS practicality
Yeah I felt like if you sat down to talk to me instead of ignore me some of the times then I could've worked it out
Anyway, I've got to get to bed. Seriously.
Ok lol
Ok sorry
No no no
My fault 150%
😘
Good night, love 😛
Idk why I have a thing for sending cute goodnight pictures 
I love goodnight pictures but that one certainly isn't cute in the traditional sense hahaha
Hahah as long as it's between us then it's okay.
Although I couldn't understand an outsider who wouldn't find it objectively cute 😘
Inside a penguin's mouth
Our spring weekend lineups of recent years, you can see the rest on brown university traditions wiki. Some crazy crazy shit
 
It's 64 outside and so perfect
Pic?
What's funny is how some years you get great options and then other years everyone must be very unimpressed 
since you'll be there for four years though you'll probably get to see All the stars
All have a huge act except maybe 2011
In class b sorry
Aimee, I know I wasn't perfect either, but I want to let you know how appreciative I am that you recognized some mistakes in your past actions and apologized for them. That sort of thing is never easy and I respect you for it 💖
I'm not sure who a lot of the performers are. The names suggest anything from country (Lauryn Hill) to rap/hip-hop to indie. Did you catch Big Freedia's name!!!?
Lol country 
She is a very important like soul-R&B-new reggae artist
Literally incredibly important singer
She did that rendition of "Killing  Softly"
I DID!!!
Lauryn hill is Haitian 
I told you that you can't blame me for not knowing names :( i recognize voices and songs
All the country singers have names like Hill and Faith and Sheryl
How interesting. I never assumed it was people who enjoyed to see others die. The way I thought of it was that there were two groups of observers: those who wanted to justice be served, and the family/friends of the executed
What class was this for?
Unless... Oh no... You learned that on reddit
He is so sweet
Infectious disease class
It went better today
He was going so slo
Slow
And most of the kids said they had NEVER read any scientific primary literature
So that gave me confidence
I've known for a while that basis is a rare case, where the students are sometimes required to read the primary literature 
Which is comforting 
I always find that out when I'm at some classes outside of school
Although sometimes the kids there are smarter 
Lol I read it maybe twice at basis
This was all from internships
Like I read it in.... My capstone biology class 
That's really it 
PNAS?
Omg what's PNAS from
Right, your internship work
PNAS is "Proceedings of the National Academy of Science" which is a very important journal lol
But really I just wanted pics
You could've been more explicit
I'm still waiting on pics from you
Wanna see dat 🍑🌺
How's your day going?
Honestly that gif is probably one of my favorites
I hate reading those scientific papers tbh
Probably will be send in the coming hours, depending on if Alex is in
What are you up to now?
Reading
Oxford history of prison
This entire library is marble on the outside
Just left the library. Too tired to read, plus probably dropping class anyway
Found a better similar class
Hi
Hey what's up😛
Oxford history of prison? What do you mean?
That's the new class you're taking?
How was your day today? What'd you do?
Today in biology we watched videos of dumb ass white boys and rattlesnakes striking them lol
Do you not think you'll be free to watch a movie?
Jay suggested we go to prom together..
Also it's really fucking stupid because billings got upset that seminar/research kids don't have to do an internship as part of their SP (not called SRP anymore?!!) so she is fighting to make us do one
And she's like "idk how I'm gonna explain to parents that you guys don't have to fulfill the internship requirement. It's unfair"
at the BASIS kindergarten they have a petting zoo class where kids learn about the anatomy
And today jay and I were complaining about the lack of potential candidates for sex and relationships, and that's when he said that about prom. "It would be fun," he said
Then after that Nathaniel told me to go for jay because he's bi, and that I should just trust him on this
What's RISD?
It's a textbook called that
The new class is called
Gastropolitics in the ancient near east!
They make food sometimes in ancient methods with ancient recipes
Today I went to two classes, studied a bit, and slept
Also ordered books
Tonight is the first night of parties of the semester so probably not but tomorrow?
Wtf billings
That is so cute, I'm glad basis is having them do kid things
Jay said he wouldn't do that
I'm not sure what's up with him
Are you sure you aren't misinterpreting
I am not misinterpreting, but you will not bring this up
Rhode Island School of Design, #2 U.S. art school
It's adjacent to brown
You gon go for it?
Yeah I saw allow
?
Allie*
Also he said this in front of the straight boys and Diviya 
That's class sounds awesome, but labs might be strenuous 
Have fun at your party!
Go for what?
If he comes onto me again at a party then idk
Also Javier and Oscar are going so
Are you upset with me?
No no not at all just busy
Tonight and tomorrow night I'm going over to Joseph's house lol
Still busy?
Or party?
Trying to party 
Ok well, sorry then
Did you enjoy it
Ok actuall nvm
Hi
I failed, I drank like one beer
And I'm chillin with girls
Shooting the shit
What's up
On my way to Joseph's
Finished hanging out with gay xican guy from work
What are all these events he is having?
It's just me and him tonight
Tomorrow is the party
Anyway. Sorry to hear about your party failure
Shooting the shit up? What does that mean
It means chatting 
K
Talked with this Asian chick from SF, super cool, and I felt like I gained insight into the whole stereotype 
Do you want to chat tomorrow?
Phone that is
I'm sorry that my time this week has been so limited
Maybe Sunday would work better, given that nights are good chat times for me and that you will be at the party tomorrow
I hope you have a great time with Joseph
I would love to chat, but I don't like being called only because you're bored 
What the fuck
What?
Calm down
That was incredibly mean
And presumptuous 
And mean
If you have something to tell me then tell me
Don't pin it on me in a passive-aggressive fashion
No I'm just saying I don't want us to become like that 
I wasn't suggesting anything 
Ok, well I call you because I want to hear from you, never from boredom
I always have things to do
Like you can call whenever you want to
I am choosing you over those, there is no time to be bored, literally
Also I was intending on talking to you tomorrow even at the party 
That won't stop me from talking to you
:)
Are you hurt
I've been wondering a lot about the stereotype, and why all the Asians in my grade are applying to UC schools
So please share 
And don't be hurt
Anyway, now I just feel bad
No it's fine, I see your intention now
I'll tell you about her over the phone. It's interesting
Ok
Seriously it fine
I'm just really tired. I shouldn't have assumed bad intent on your part
I appreciate that you even talk to me, idk why you would assume that my comment was bitchy
I'm grateful for the time you take out of your day to text me and call me
It makes me feel good about things
Anyway, yeah. You wanna be left alone now?
It's almost 3 am there
That's the hour I become alive at
That's so sweet
Hahaha 😘
Don't ever think I'm not missing you
Though I hope you know that I'm glad that you fight through your conflicted feelings to chat to me too
No I never think that for an instant
Probably because I tell you all the damn time hahah
My conflicted feelings?
Just like with all the emotions and that I'm bad at chatting back
Things will calm down in the coming weeks
It's just all SO busy now
0 time
It's upsetting at times but I understand
I know it is
I've considered not talking to you until you have free time 
I would be hurt too
No I don't think that's a good idea though
Like letting things settle in
That's also the conclusion I came too
I think that will create distance
Nina was telling me how her and Ivan are literally like us
Because they spent the night together and got annoyed with each other
But then the moment they stopped talking for a few days they missed each other like crazy
I thought it was funny that she thought of us
Because they also did the whole "we're not compatible" thing
I didn't know you considered my feelings in this situation
Like the situation where you're busy and have no time
I was especially hurt when we were supposed to watch the movie and I made time for that
But like I said, I completely understand and I think something special is how I'm willing to compromise for you
Have you started heading back to your dorm yet?
I'm in my dorm on my bed for the last while lol
I thought they were just always perfect!
Would you like pictures to help you fall asleep? :P
Or will you just pass out
Lol that's how everyone appears
I had to stop working today because I got distracted by thoughts of your cock
The only reason people assume we aren't is because of how vocal I am to Diviya and Nate
But it's been nothing but great things
For months
Pics would be great to send now as a wake up tomorrow morning ;)
Lol you think you have it bad? At least you don't get raging boners while driving and in class because of it
When things clear up, I do want to watch the movie. I'll find time eventually.
I almost felt like pulling over because I couldn't stop thinking of you and I wanted to jerk it
Literally tried to work for probably an hour but I was thinking about you fucking me from behind
I've missed your tongue on the tip of my cock
I miss holding and licking your cock
Ok wow I am very hard
You shall see in the morning
Although!
Send pics!
I'll open them tomorrow
Goodnight 🍑
Whoa 
Thanks b
I love you
Hope to hear from you soon
I miss you
Goodnight 
 
:( 
Are you okay today?
Did I say something?
Ya ya I've just been working
Omg those pic
Pics
Of boys
I know right
Still busy?
Hi
Hello
Just getting back from club. Surprisingly fun! How is the party
Fun
Two gays came with me in oscars place
He sent them for me
That Ahmed kid and someone else
Club?
Yeah, some person was having a 21st and invited all of brown to a local club 
They only asked for brown ID so
Lots of fun. 
How has your day been!!
That's fun
I just went with a group who couldn't dance at all but we were ok
That's good
?
??
???
Sorry
I'm so drunk
Are you at least having a good time?
Jay and I
I might have an orgy
With grindr guy whos here
Ignore it
Don't say anything
What's wrong
You left me all day
I hope you're enjoying your time :(
Ok
This is final
I don't want to talk to you for the remainder of the year
It's not good for either of us
Good bye
It's unfortunate that you have been so influenced by those surrounding you. I don't think I have been unreasonable
I don't think so either, but I don't feel valued
And you yourself said we won't work out
So I'm taking your word
As you wonderfully realized today
I still really enjoy your presence
I just don't think relationship in the traditional sense is realistic. I'm sorry that you don't feel valued though, because I value the most of anyone in my life 
I don't think it's realistic in the long distance, but I had hopes for when you came back
It makes me sad when you say you're studying and you can't be honest with me about things like that
But I am studying
Like I was being honest each time you asked
Like literally that IS what I did today
And what I did pretty much all the other time.
But I do apologize seriously 
But I am being completely honest when I said it was kissing and nothing more, and that I didn't enjoy it in the slightest
Do you like me anymore?
Just wondering
Yes, I miss you a lot, every day
I miss your optimism
Your carefree spirit 
Ok well I'm drunk right now and I'll talk to you tomorrow. Please don't be upset if I do things with others
I'm sorry that things got so messy
I really am
This is really difficult for me
I hope you understand
Like it's actually a very stressful thing to not be able to occupy my time with someone I care about
It's alright, I do understand
I still care abut you a lot and I'm sorry for being needy
I am actually so upset that I got mad with you
I have been trying so hard to more accommodating and understanding
And I think I did a good job until now
I still love you
Hey
Not my RA
Good zone
So, I feel that much of my effort in talking to you has been in futility, and I don't blame a disconnect between us on myself
Regardless I hope you're doing well and I will talk to you later
Whenever later may be
That's the only reason I have been why I have been
I don't blame you either at all, but I had hoped you would take it better, that these few weeks here are beyond difficult for me. That said, I don't know that that's a fair hope. 
From my perspective all the things you were doing and going to it seemed like a blast 
I really REALLY am beyond happy to talk to you. Though I see how my actions seem not to reflect that as of late. It's a hard situation. I personally believe that in a few weeks things will fall into a more predictable pattern such that I will have more quiet alone time
But I get it- I have been working yes, but socializing also yes
And that time could have gone to you
It's blast, but a stressful one 
I don't really have an answer for you that justifies my lack of communication, but I'm upset with myself too
Well, there has never really been a manifestation of my frustrations until last night. 
And that was only because of the circumstances
Jay and I held each other and cried in some room and everyone was watching us from the outside window
They all thought we were gonna do something
We decided to order a pizza at 2:30am and it was mainly us two alone all night, until Taylor threw up at 3am
The party died around 1am ish
Yes- I did think you were taking it better until last night. 
Also some gay guy now thinks I am dating him?
But that was naive of me
How would you rate your night
I don't remember what happened to make him think that's the case
Aside from what happened it would have been a 7/10
Maybe 7.5
I had a lot of fun and talked to every single person and sang my songs
I felt so accepted by the gay guys and straight guys.
The straight boys asked me questions about my life on the roof
We drank Malibu and got bit by Mosquitos hahah
Alex Elwood was there and so was Ben Wood Pavitch (?)
I didn't have any bad moments until the phone call and after that
Yeah they seem to come around to everything they are not banned from
Carly tried to invite them to my last party
Where I cried for almost 20 minutes and then decided to stop being sad
Alex Ellinwood and Ben Wood-Pavicich 
Btw I didn't really control over what I was saying last night over text
I wasn't exactly alone when that was happening
Sergio see on
Ok
can we step back for a moment
Of course
I feel very strongly that yes, I was not helpful in the situation BUT
I had a dream a few minutes ago (just woke up) that you texted me and told me to vote in the next election
This is very clearly external influence that is harming us. Ultimately we enjoy each other's company
Last night you were so rude about it
On the phone
You were incredibly mean to me too
You sounded really mean
You were being horrible to me
What exactly happened?
Telling me you were going to have an orgy, like threatening me with it
All I remember is you yelling at me
Describing the gays
How they had perfect asses
Throwing back in my face the language you once described me with
I feel sick
And absolutely terrible
And I am crying
I'm so sorry, Aimee
Like that's really mean
I'm sorry for being mean, really sorry. But you really really hurt me and I was trying to keep it together. I don't recall all that I said, but nothing, from my perspective, matched what you said to me
Talking about guys from grindr
How you were gonna do jay and nico and oscar and his friends and that they grabbed your dick
And Javier
Call me?
Of course, just a second
Let me go somewhere
When we talk you need to tell me about the Waterfire thing!
Ok!
I hope you know how much I care for you 😘 hope you're getting stuff done and you have a goodnight
Being sick in college is no fun because you have to go to class anyway or suffer heavily 
And no one will care for you, or give a shit
Seriously it just sucks
I'm sorry :( in DC when I was sick that was terrible, although the people were caring hahah
They took me to CVS to get medicine
The class thing actually sucks a lot
There's no high school leniency or parents to watch over you
If I were there I would make you tea and put a humidifier in your room and rub Vicks on your chest and feet lol
IT EXISTS
I mean I could be like "I'm sick" and not show up but that would not change a thing 
Like they wouldn't judge me for not showing up but
Assignments would not change, all I might get is to talk to the prof about lecture MAYBE
Awww
I made tea and coffee and had hot pho
There is some cool food here
Lol my feet??
And I took anti-nausea and cough drops 
And tried to take some DayQuil pills but they were too big and I knew would make me vomit 
Where did you find that
Some of the cool foods have been the pho, some chicken curry, thanksgiving food (all of it)
Do people ever ditch classes? I know that's a huge problem for public state schools 
That's great! Is this food accessible to you at any hours of the day?
So I mean it happens from time to time, especially if the class is not dynamic and all can be gleaned from the posted online resources but
Lol yeah, the feet thing is a xican tradition
I calculated it and 
You can actually look it up
OMG yes the DayQuil pills make me vomit too. They always turn horizontal instead of vertical :(
The book was at savers lol
Each class is basically worth $150+ in tuition
Seriously it is just stupid not to go
Unless you have some midterm and the class doesn't do shit 
Lol my roommate had to BUY a bible for class
Like each class period you attend?! Fuck!
Like where are those missionaries when you need them
Yep. Each and every one. 
I was about to say it's not the case for private schools because they're actually paying around $20k+
Given, the tuition actually covers many more services than just classes so it's a bit of a misrepresentation 
Which class haha? I think a bible would be helpful for some of connollys classes or APUSH
Lol how did you learn the feet thing? You aren't even a good xican
I love personalized bibles with sleeve cases and your name engraved on the cover
Lol my mom used to do it for me and so did all of my xican babysitter
It's called Jesus and the gospels lol
Lol didn't you get one of the personalized ones?
Hahaha wtf?!! Why's he taking that class
He says it's good
It's not like preachy lol
It's like a lit class
What's up with you now?
Are you still reading?
I had a dream today that we met in a Brown office and fucked, and each time my cock ran across your 🌺, and specifically your little 🍆, shivers ran down our bodies
Like we were uncontrollably shaking and it was beautiful
And I just held you and kept you close to me, nuzzled in my chest
I can understand that. That's how connollys was basically
I just got back from reading. Almost finished. I have some time in the middle of the day tomorrow to finish another 5 pages lol
I had a personalized one and I got it for my birthday.... Lol
That's wonderful! I'm happy for you
:( wanting the 🍆
Lol well I can't say the same
I've honestly not desired anything more than you
In your entirety
It was so sad because today I grabbed candy for you and then remembered you're gone
:( what candy was it
I miss you too so much. And desire you
I think a lot about yours 
Or rather you and yours 
They were some whoppers and I was getting them because they were the closest thing to twin
Reid
Twix 
Do you have time for pics b?
If you want to go to sleep that's completely fine :)
Yesterday I was upset because I thought about how sad it would be if we actually stopped talking
And liking each other
And like when you came back we wouldn't see each other
Unfortunately I'm in my room w Alex so sorry b 
Which I would hate to have happen 
I'll try for it when I can
Same.
That was one of my biggest fears
Ok don't worry!
I got a bomb ass haircut actually that looks sexy as fuck
Got it yesterday 
Too bad I can't see it in that pic lol
That's me from DC lol
I'll send pics tomorrow!
Haven't showered today
Sometimes I smell you on myself
Yesterday I smelled your 🌺 smell and it made me so nostalgic and horny
Ok anyway lol I need to stop
No no no
know that you are loved and wanted
No no no I want to hear from you
Thanks for that
Though I want you to know that I am fine
That guy didn't hurt me, seriously 
What?
I was saying this because I wanted to
Oh ok
Lol
Ok anyway
Where did you smell the smell?
Don't laugh
🌺 at savers and you in general from my deodorant
Whose? 
Whose?
Whose what
Like
Where did you have 🌺 at savers
I'm not sure
Don't really remember
Anyway bb
Lol 
Alright well goodnight 
;)
And I just wanna say also
My 🌺 smell has changed radically since T, it's not really a typical 🌺 smell at all
It's a lot more ball-y 
Lol I thought you were gonna say something sweet
Related to a goodnight
 Oh also 
I've noticed the change in scent, believe it or not.
Really?
describe 
It smells more 🍆 like now than it used to
Good thing? Or neutral?
Brutally honest here, but I remember when it used to be kinda fishy the way it's described, which never bothered me
Like when I gave head I could see
And then when I did it the past couple of months it tasted like dickish 
Gotcha 
Still I think it's kinda gross that it tasted like anything
But anyway
It's distinct and I like it
Gives me something to remember you by :P
I hope you enjoy the remainder of your evening !! 
Or night rather
Hahahaha
I'm gonna open all your snaps tomorrow and....
read your essay maybe
Lol I'm going to be doing homework all night until 2 am probably
:(
Oh, I thought you opened all my snaps yesterday? Hmm. It says you did.
Ah, nvm. I see you didn't.
I still love you very much. That much has not changed.
What's crazy to me is that no matter how upset I am with you that never changes
No matter how distant or how much time has passed
I think that's the nature of it
You still manage to put me in a daze
Lol it's only been 2 weeks though hahaha
Lol well I didn't see you almost all of January 
Nah I was only gone for like 10 days tops 
Ok you came back Jan 17th
And left jan 5 or 6
Oh boo hoo mister 
So I was a bit off but still
Why do you have to question my feelings
Sorry
No, I'm joking!
It wasn't meant like that
:)
Oh ok!
I await everything
I look forward to many things
And most importantly, I love you I love you I love you
 
I swear to god I'm gonna be that guy who makes a proposal video with clips from vacations and shit lol
I wore that shirt today (needed a red shirt for event)
Probably write my own song
Everyone asked the Waldo question 
Have it as a voice over
Hahahaha
Lol some customer at savers said I look like a xican Waldo and her friend looked at the lady funny
Like "bitch, no"
Also my haircut is basically the one in that pic lol
ANYWAY
talking to you is always a pleasure
I will do anything in my power to never hurt you again the way I did last night
Goodnight, my favorite person ever in the world who I also love more than anyone in the world!!!🌚
My RA smokes constantly 
And gives no fucks about the smell
The other kids in the hall use something to cover the smell
Cigarettes??
Weed
She's a great RA tho
Lol that is absurd. How old is she? Are RAs usually seniors?
Lol I was about to bitch about how these weak ass hoes are wearing sweaters but it's 57 and I'm in shorts 
For the Hampshire incoming freshman orientation 
She is a senior but our other two are sophomores 
So she's 21
"Don't worry if you're "trans enough" to attend"
Lol that's actually kinda hilarious 
Omg did I tell you the stories of the public misgendering I witnessed 
Twice 
No! Please do
That's actually very cold??? I get cold in 70 degrees lol
I used to be that way too but I guess I adapted
Cos I feel the same as I would if it were 77 in Tucson 
What is afropunk
See it everywhere here
New comments on your essay 
Lol That's so awkward because imagine growing up and being in your 40s in 2015 and having to accommodate for this new gender movement 
Like how unusually uncomfortable it is to change your speaking patterns
Lol well since you're the most sensitive to temperature between the both of us I think it would fare well for me 
Afropunk is black punk lol
Trying to break that lanky white boy in a punk band stereotype 
Thanks btw for comments
I feel like I want to change my essay ugh 
Like dramatic changes. Start over.
I'm going to a concert tomorrow. Hippie Sabotage lol
I miss you
Lol I stapled on the wrong cover page to an article so I read the wrong article for class today fuck
Scrambled to read it but only got through half oh well
Saw a guy and I wasn't sure if he had disproportional man boobs or massive pecs, he was slightly slightly chubby 
Football players have pretty faces but way too much body fat
And they're dumb
Why that particular concert?
Alpha lesbian on my floor is constantly with girls lol
Though I saw one hick looking boy, awful flattop haircut, football looking, he was reciting like a hundred digits of Pi
What the fuck
There is a family of Orthodox Jews on the main green
Sounding the shofar 
Like Hasidic Jews
For some punk kid with a Snapback who is watching 
And it's like the kid who is blowing it
It's like so random
And the kid has been up to it for at least 5 minutes 
Thank you so much :)
Hearing that from you actually made me feel a lot more confident in my abilities 
Also, I finally auditioned again without crying. I was flat for a few lines but overall I am more proud of myself.
Still got a main role though
Lol how random!!! That's hilarious as fuck. 
I just imagine the kid blowing the shofar and the SnapBack kid calling it gnarly and rad, while the family members chant and circle around 
How did you manage in class without thoroughly reading the material? Is it easy to bs your way through it?
Brown has a football team? I've always thought that about football players, though.
They're all about chest and  knuckle bumping and thinking that breaking bones is "tight"
That particular concert because Reyna invited me lol
How was your day today!
My friend from New Zealand posted snaps from the beach there and it looks like something out of The Chronicles of Narnia
My SRP is finalized
So it's still the anti-semitism on college campuses (which is self-defined by each case and student) and how has it evolved over the past 70 years. My hypothesis is that the rise in these attacks stems from activism and groups that muddle international affairs with domestic affairs, and confuse Israelis with Jews   
And also, I feel that the more educated students (students at elite institutions) tend to be the perpetrators of these attacks. I'm going to compare the number of attacks at Pima and UA, and discuss how one is slightly more selective, etc.
And that this trend can be tied to why it is that an Ivy League (columbia) is one of the most anti-Semitic college campuses in America 
 
New Zealand
Just got $285.89 today hollaaaaaa
I'm so glad that I've been saving my money
I plan on getting a new iPhone and glasses, and then saving the rest for vacation and college
Are you still working at savers
What about saving for college visits
That explains why my family is going to services today!!
Yes, the Pima housing situation is something I took into consideration. Also like two years on campus vs. four
Well, one thing for certain is that the Columbia faculty allow full expression of ideas for their students
And most of it is the muddling, like I mentioned earlier.
“One incident that disturbed me and made me feel personally uncomfortable—practically for the rest of the semester—occurred to me in one of my early Arabic classes.” This is Aharon Horowitz speaking. He’s kippah-clad and round-faced, looking directly into the camera. It’s one of Columbia Unbecoming’s more memorable moments. “The professor used the word man a na, which means ‘to prevent’ in Arabic,” he continues. “I asked him how to use the verb. And he wrote on the board: ‘Israel prevents ambulances from going into refugee camps.’ ” Here, Horowitz pauses, then points to his scalp. “I have to say, I really don’t think he would have said that had I not been wearing this on my head.”
This is absolutely terrible.
Where are the SJWs to defend this kid when something like that is said?!
I work only on weekends for a couple of hours. My shifts are now 3-5 hours long. 
I'm already visiting NY in November, and I'm debating between doing a Minnesota visit (Mac and Carleton) or MA visit (5 colleges, BU, Harvard, Northeastern, Tufts)
On the NY trip I have to schedule my Bard, SL, and Vassar overnights. NYU and Fordham don't do them though.
How are you able to speak for these voice recordings lol?
Are you still sick b? :(
Yes I'm sicker 
Hahahah 
Wait but I thought you submitted a letter?
Are you in those overnights?
Walking and talking!!
Clubs here are so serious
I'm gonna do swing dancing
Cos it's not 
I took a swing dancing class for a week with my church, and then I was able to recall some of the moves when I was in DC
Lots of fun and sometimes upper body strength (if you're going to flip the girl like I was working on)
I never fully got it
I just have to pick the dates that I want
After they saw my letter they felt bad for all the hours they were giving me and told me I can only work weekends if I want to
Anyway, go finish your reading and club stuff
I feel bad for distracting you hahah
Also lol you don't have the time to read my links and stuff
Which is cool cool
Fucked up article
My schedule got ducked 
Fucked 
During lunch Joseph and I went around asking how much people would sell their virginity for 
What happened with it?
Anyway I assume you're tired and asleep and stuff
So goodnight
Fuck Sergio
I just woke up and remembered that I promised to call you
Haha that's fine
Can I call you tomorrow in the morning? I will be done with class around 10 aka 7 your time?
Why did you wake up so suddenly?
No idea
I'm gonna back to sleep now tho lol
So good night!!! 
Yeah, you can always call whenever
Ok great
Goodnight!
🌚
I got into that virus class I wanted 
That's why my schedule is fucked 
Hey, congratulations!!!
Hey I am so fucking sick 
I didn't realize how bad it was until I got to class and I had no tissues
It was so gross
I was so embarrassed 
I'm sorry :( was it small enough to where everyone could hear you?
At least you'll be better prepared for next time!!!
You should take as many naps as you can today
No but like there were people around and I had to keep pinching my nose to keep it from dripping 
I just feel gross. Gonna take a shower now 
That's probably a good idea. I hope you feel a lot better and nap and I find that for myself the Chinese medicine pressure points help alleviate sinus buildup.
As does showering :)
I also got sick too but it's nothing bad yet. My throat hurts.
How are classes?
Call?
FaceTime also possible
Lol I thought you were showering??
Oh no, I was about to shower
Unfortunately I am going to shower now though
I also decided to shower because you were
When I sent that I got out of the shower
Yeah I figured, but I had to get going because I have a 11AM meeting 
But the fucking advisors isn't here 
She literally already missed one meeting
Oh okay well have a good day!
I'll call when I can, I should have time this evening. 
Hahah alright
Sergio OMG 
Did you know there are 50 million viruses that infect bacteria in a milliliter of seawater?
Literally, 10^31 of these viruses on earth. 10x the number of bacteria 
they are fucking everywhere!
They destroy up to 40% of the world's bacteria every day
I sang from my diaphragm for the first time in my life today
And I felt so confident and everyone was amazed and said it sounded beautiful
Also lol I did not know that
I've never been more proud of myself
Like I was astonished
I don't know how anyone could sing from anywhere besides their diaphragm it's not a high note
It just clicked
Tell me all about your day!!!
Can I call?
is everything alright?
Ya ya
I just have time now, figure it's a more efficient means to communicate
Reyna and I got invited to the UA dorms lol
U gon go?
Of course!
How's studying going
It's going ok. I'm moving my notes to electronic form which is cool. And printing things and reading
You mean typing them up?
Or is there some brown notes forum lol
Yeah. I was taking them on legal pads which wasn't working out
Reyna and I helped Oscar with his math homework
Lol is he smart
Lol no he's doing 6th grade math according to basis standards
We also got invited to a dorm party On weekend 
U of A vs Brown :(
I might end up taking the equivalent of Calc AB this semester because the AB/BC accelerated one is full, and I need another class 
Lol and I'm getting invites to the UA gay events
They don't check who is a student or not
Nice!
Here they ask for ID a LOT
I wanna hear more about your evening tomorrow? Gotta get dat sleep :(
Fuck! I miss calc AB so much, but game theory is actually getting easier
Hahah yeah! I understand
Glad to phone chat today
I still miss you!
And I wish we had more time to talk haha
🌚🍆🌺😢😍🆒💩
🐢
Same. 
So much
I really think things are starting to wind down
Talking to you today was so great 
Like I loved telling you about my day and hearing about yours
😘🍑😭🐢📚❤️🌚
I hope you have a great night bb 
U2
Did you see the gay age gap video
Ya 
Though to me, if it is a deterrent to weird age gap relationships that's good
How do you mean?
That like if they can't engage over media maybe they won't get together 
Bio nature walk today!!!
Saw a western whiptail and bullfrog
Ornate tree lizard
Ouch
Pic?
Oh I didn't see your text!
Why ouch?
What's up
I only have this picture because the lizards we tried catching ran away from us :(
Republican debate
Ouch was a typo
It was supposed to say "pic"
It's such a mess
Bella looks pissed 
How was your day?
Haha yeah, I was gonna watch it but I got out of drama at 5:30 and then went to SAAF
Choreography today was so much fun! We finished one song 
How was SAAF??
was it hard choreography?
Lol that was actually a picture of Bella modeling :P
My day was great, actually. Pitzer presentation today and I talked to the guy about my academic trajectory and he was telling me that there's now more of an emphasis on who I am NOW and my involvement with the community
Reyna: ugh, I ate like 10 pounds of edamame
Sergio: shit hipsters say
SAAF was so much fun and Michael loves us so much. We are gonna be AIDS walk cheerleaders and he's gonna give us SAAF crop tops lol
He talked to us afterwards. Reyna and I were invited a SAAF boy with us downtown, but he said next week and he got all red and embarrassed because he wished he could come with us
But his ride was almost there
The choreography was nothing I couldn't do. Got my pirouette down! :)
You should listen to the song from AIDA, "another pyramid" :)
How are you doing my love
Tell me about your day
Today I went to the lab, and didn't royally fuck up, in fact I think I did comparatively well, but it felt shitty. I had to redo a part cos I fucked up the instructions. 
Haha SAAF croptop pics a must later
I didn't really do anything today. I worked. I went to the presidential debate. I took a nap. I was sick. 
And the debate was funny AF
Pitzer!!!
I had like 6.5 hours of class 
So that was much of my day
I found out about phenol cough spray (phenol is a chemical I used to breakdown cells, it dissolves skin, and apparently throat grossness in low concentrations)
Hahah did your prior lab experience help out at all?
Which class was this for?
It did actually, I was fast AF
I'm sorry :( I hope you feel better relatively soon
PHAGE
whoops caps
You still sick?
Lol did you get any of that phenol cough spray?
I'm actually not sick! I mistakenly thought my hoarseness was sickness 
Reyna and I are walking around 4th to put up AIDS walk posters 
I hope you had a wonderful day :)
Also the new CCs are so inexperienced, it's upsetting
I'm always here to talk to you and I will make time for you whenever you need it :)
I did. It was ok
Tasted like unpleasant memories
How are the CCs dojnfv
Doing?
Joseph is so touchy with me and the rest of our friend group, and today when he either squeezed my thigh or tickled me I realized how much I missed your touch
:( I go to sleep dreaming of you holding me every night
Lots of sex dreams of you
Lol I had a dream about you last night
I dream of the day you return and that's what gets me through my day
Massive boners in research today
I imagine my warm mouth on your 🌺
Devouring you
Kissing your inner thigh
I daydreamed about kissing and sucking your 🍆 which is new
I also daydreamed about you doing that today too!
What a coincidence 
Today when I got sweaty I was like "God, I'm sweaty like I just finished car sex"
Have you opened my snaps yet?
No! I plan on it tomorrow morning
I have to let you go so I wake up tomorrow but 
Let's try to chat tomorrow
Okay, my love
Whenever I hear from you it makes me so happy 
I can not even express how much I care about you
I am actually so in love with you and I miss you so much more than anyone
You are the person I feel so comfortable around
I feel very existentially alone since leaving. I really miss you too. A lot. I miss our openness and closeness. And your touch
I loved how we could say whatever we wanted to and usually not judge the other
Okay! Well go to sleep 😘
I will talk to you tomorrow :) have a goodnight
Hopefully you feel better
We can fanfic this lol
Fanfic this??
*gives Aimee a goodnight kiss* *massages his shoulders* *tickles his little toes* *wraps my arms around him and pulls him into my body* *wraps my legs around his*
Lol
Hahahaha
I'm a fan though
You can continue if you want, I'll read as I wake up
Or later sometime
Continue the fanfic?
I'll write you a sex story
Since I have no homework haha
I want to go to Iceland and play with the puffins
I ended up falling asleep but I dreamt of you 💖
Sup?
Can I call
Hey sorry I'm about to eat dinner right now :(
Will you be fee after?
What's up
I can still text you?
Or let me know when you want to talk
Hi
I was working
I'll be free for a bit
But in like 20 min I won't be free. I could call you at like 8 your time
If I'm not too exhausted
Oh shit
Well I finished eating but we could wait until you're done with your thing
And you are on your way back to your dorm or whatever 
I can call now
I'm in the restroom right now lol
I'll be out in a few
IDGAF but ok
U r so cute
U r 2 cute
Hi!! ❤️❤️
How's my bb 
Les Miserables sing a long
So great!
Wowwww how unfair is this life I am living
Don't answer, let me
VERY
It's so great having people around constantly 
lol I'll bet it is
Finished 5 college applications already so that's all I've been working on all night
Kenyon, northeastern, Sarah Lawrence, Case Western, Fordham
And American, oops
Btw I wasn't being rude :(
Why case?
I'm so glad you finished! 
But it's so early lol
Case as a kinda safety
How did les mis sing a long go?
It was a blast!
Wait when did I say you were being rude? Forgot
But case is like hard to get into?
I guess it's less hard to get into than others you applied to
Did Carleton eventually accept you for fly-in?
Well what's weird to me is that Winkelman told me to apply to Pitzer and after Kittredge read my writing, he suggested I apply to Reed
And Case Western is pushing for more gay students
Also it's free to apply and they give $$$$$$$
You didn't say I was being rude but I thought you didn't reply to me because you thought I was
Carleton fly in applications run until Sept. 30th :/
I probably won't find out until mid-October
Did you have any dreams?
I had a dream that I got to plan my own vacation and I decided to go to Madagascar and Spain
The reason I'm trying to finish early is because I have like 12 more schools to apply to lol
Lol what do you mean they are pushing for gays?? Did they say that???
I can't recall dreams from last night :(
Bethany showed me this weird anime that she thought was scarring but I thought was fine 
Is that his dick
How is your morning
Open the picture
Oh hahahahahah
The boy looks just out of "Paris is Burning"
Like precisely
Even a brooch 
Except the ginger ale
Ooh he's wearing my shoes
It's chicken finger Friday which is apparently a big deal 
They didn't explicitly state that, but they're trying to uphold their ranking as one of the top LGBT friendly campuses. On the application I was asked what my gender AND orientation are
Which is strange for a public university
Lol I remember Gravity DJ yaoi, the gay anime that used to give me boners
And even though Zoe showed it to me she got pissed up whenever I brought it up
My morning is fine. My mom makes terrible breakfasts!! :( her eggs are so wet and slimy....
How was your morning?
Chicken finger Friday? Hahahah a. A lot of places I know have taco Tuesdays. You gonna get some chicken today?
Case is private...
I passed it in OHIO
Oh yeah I meant to say that sorry lol
I think we have taco Tuesday too
Did you fucking listen to any of the AIDA songs?
Sorry about your eggs :(
No bb sorry, soon
My morning was wake up-shower-class
The epic of Gilgamesh is steamy
yeah I read that hahahah, beastiality at its finest and most ancient
And something about prostitutes to take honor
Or maybe that's siddartha 
But I swear there's a prostitute in Gilgamesh 
There is
Why are you reading it?
What did case look like? Is it nice?
I'm not reading it, but Doug is and he shared some words from it
The area was pretty AF, tbh I just saw the exit, didn't take the exit
Alright well I'm gonna goo
*go
Ok bb
Have a good day!
Ok sorry I'm being stupid
I was just saying bye because I'm a little bitch
But yes you too have a great day
?
?? It's what I said lol
Listen to these from AIDA:
Another Pyramid, How I Know You, My Strongest Suit, Dance of the Robe
I sing How I Know You (original and reprise), Not , and I'm ensemble
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
I actually can not believe it
"We received a record number of applications this year and look forward to welcoming what promises to be our most impressive cohort of students this year"
I'm just thrilled beyond belief
!!!!
I think you'll probably get into the college then
I conducted a phone interview and when I had to explain my grades in 10th grade, my coming out and losing my dad slipped my mind
All I said was "um, I just had a transition of maturity"
Anyway
But this is so perfect
:DDDD
You ok?
Drank
??
I feel bad because I was expecting you to tell me about your day
And I don't want you thinking I don't care or I'm selfish
I'm sorry!
You sure you're alright?
I'm here if you need anything
I only left you alone because I assumed you needed a break and you were busy
Anyway have q good one
Hi
Sorry, I was totally fine last night, just super wasted
Alrighty
I love the art gallery
How was your night last night
I want to win that calendar. The artist compiled all the dick pics she received and made it 'avant-garde' 
I talked to Jennifer a lot (she got her wisdom teeth out, Joseph brought her flowers, we discussed future plans and applications)
Went to work
Did some writing
I was invited to two things this weekend (last night and tonight party) but I'm not in the mood
One was at Boy Scout boy's house....
They're both sleepovers
How was your night?
There is a pizza decal covered limbo on the green 
Uneventful and whiskey-filled. 
How do you feel about your essays?
I am still so happy about Carleton
And the dick calendar
lol what's the limbo occasion? I forgot that game existed and the purpose of it. 
Haha really? It was great because I only worked for three hours
Next month is so fucking busy for me because of farm camp, fly in, AIDS walk, and the Harvey show
I have a Reed interview next week
I'm sorry your night was uneventful :(
Those parties are always the worst.
My essays are some of the strongest things for my applications. I have outstanding ECs and test scores. 
I remember how judgmental I was about you talking about college so I really need to stop haha
I'm so happy about it too. Like out of 500 applicants I was chosen.
As one of the 50
I would totally go there. Like can you imagine how happy I am to know that one of the top liberal arts colleges in America accepted me for a fucking fly in, despite a shitty GPA 
I mean... Seriously?!
And everyone was like "yeah you know, your GPA is really not gonna let you do much"
Yes! Dick calendar! I'll get you one and you'll get me a fleshlight
Have you seen any of the Instagram stuff?
My Carleton essay about empowerment is about how im capable of empowering myself by putting on a face of confidence and facing my shortcomings head on 
Shortcomings or uncomfortable situations.
Anyway have a great day, talk to ya later
We played limbo like 3 times lol
Like it has just come up a lot
My roommate is freakishly good at it
No my night was fun and uneventful
I couldn't tell you any specific funny thing that happened but I had a bosh
Blast
"My essays are some of the strongest things for my applications. I have outstanding ECs and test scores. "
Doucheeee
Yes that's so true!
I still have a reminder on my phone calendar to buy a flashlight when I turn 18
Gonna check out the insta in a bit, I'm napping off and on
Oh ok sorry, enjoy your napping
Awww Allie's turtle died 
Apparently frisbee is a huge thing at Carleton. Also I'll be on campus for Halloween spirit!
You're gonna mail it to me, right?
Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ughhhhhhhhh
Uuuuggghhhhhhh
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhghghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm going into hiding from now on
Catch you on the new year
Loved all of the pics you sent!!!
Especially wrong hole
Why hiding?
Yeah imma send it
I saw the turtle thing that is my worst nightmare
All the pics I sent?
On snapchat or Instagram?
At first I read it as you having a nightmare about your turtle dying 
Hiding so you can flourish
You are a plant and I am the sun, only I never give you time to breathe because my beams bombard you
I can't believe you'll be in town for Aida!
It's funny because when the rep for evergreen state came all the straight boys left lol
Insta and snap
When is AIDA?
Was the rep punkish
Last year they were genderqueer
I did an acrobatics class today!!
I didn't go to the presentation, but this is what Joseph and I observed in class and we laughed for so long
Aida is Jan 8th and 9th I think
How did that go, considering your flexibility and everything?
I've always wanted to do something like that, or gymnastics 
I plan on running track or playing volleyball in college 
Also sorry for not replying
I don't really check my phone In the afternoon anymore because I'm not expecting responses haha
Aimee, I hate the way I'm feeling
I really can't do this anymore
It is neither of our faults, but I crave attention that you are incapable of giving me at the moment and I feel that it would be best if we focus on things in our respective places.
I feel so alone all the time, no matter who I'm with, and it's not helpful when you tell me the same but make no effort about it
It's unfair to the both of us
Good night
I am here to listen to any thoughts and solutions
Hi
Sorry I was asleep until just now
Look, I don't have a solution and I would rather talk over the phone but
Yeah, actually I really don't have a solution. I want to talk to you, I want to hear from you. Are you upset because we don't speak enough or upset because you feel me slipping away, or another reason? 
Both. You seem to be gradually becoming more disinterested in me with every day.
And I feel like not talking leads to slipping away
I feel as though I have maintained the same level of contact more or less since getting here
I agree with your sentiment, that not talking leads to slipping away. I am not more disinterested  though. 
See that's where I disagree with you
Like I really feel like communication has diminished
But honestly it's fine 
Weekends are also the busy time of the week for me, but I see what you are saying
We saw a 30 year old man running shirtless out of the room across from mine at 3AM... Back and forth
How was he allowed in the dorms????
At the UA you need a pass to even use the elevator lol
Or enter the building
Last night I ditched Boy Scout boy and went downtown
Also a clearly transwoman who was very passable came into savers yesterday and my coworker asked if she was a man or a woman
Idk if you saw the chat but my mom asked if Carleton was like Pima 
What's your day looking like today?
I think he was a student... Just old looking 
How was she clearly trans but very passable 
Lol how did you respond 
Just the voice when she asked for the restrooms. It's like looking at Caitlyn Jenner but then hearing her speak.
Today I am going to the street fair 
Then working
I said, "Selina, she is probably a transwoman but a woman nevertheless."
Oh, to my mom
Lol it took me a long time to explain that college did not mean community college and that university does not make an institution better than a college
My family still doesn't get it but that's alright
What does the street fair have to offer?
Is everyone going?
What did she say to Celinav
?
Selina*
Lol Grand Canyon University
Do they believe you about Carleton?
Never mind just saw message
That's what it was
Yeah a lot of people went
Is that you???????
Yeah lol it's my potential Halloween costume
Your butt looks massive
In a good way
Is that intended for a woman?
It's so curvy
Yes exactly
Yeah I think so  but I look hot
Now that I'm not wearing any underwear or shirt under it
It's not so bulky
Like I like the first and last pic, the second is weird 
Ya I do agree tho
Is the second with clothes under
Yeah it is
It's the most awkward
What's up today
Oh it was an art festival
What kinds of things did you see?
Any recent pics? Performances?
Any fun food!!! Haha
The trans woman just walked away :(
I was so sad
These are the things I live for
Protecting the underrepresented
All kinds of graphic design art, shirts, glass work, paintings
I'll take some pics, what do you want pics of?
Lol no fun food at all
I had a shitty burrito (high standards)
And some very ok pho
And some pretty good granola
And good squash
And crappy ravioli
And some ok chicken fingers 
What do you mean she walked away?
Oh I thought you would've taken pics in general
I love the basic descriptions of each thing you ate. 
"Shitty" "very ok" "pretty good" "good" "crappy" "ok"
Saw the Carleton student at brown
What does the library look like
What is your view from your room like
She walked away to use the restrooms and Selina said that really loudly
Idk why it takes you so long to open snapchat. It's bizarre.
Today I worked and quit (yay), went clothes shopping for Minnesota, and hung out with some coworker
Only the work was planned so I wasn't sure what my day would consist of
Sorry idk they are very basic foods
Not much to say
I think he was just a brown student from MN
Cute shirt color though
I'll take pics in the morning!
What are you gonna wear there? How cold will it be?
Is sing you
Missing
You
I thought a lot about you today
:)
I have too, actually
I'll call tomorrow?
Hahah you think bout yourself? :P
You liked the shirt color? I don't remember exactly what Colors it was but I remember not liking it
I hate the blue and gold
Morning pics, yay
If I were you I would've taken pics of every shit I took
Ok, not really, but you get the idea
Btw I just woke up
Time to pull out my scarves!!! My Halloween costume too.
In the past it's snowed during the program, and there are apparently wild parties for Halloween
Alright well you're probably asleep and stuff, sorry
Talk to you later
Haha, no I mean I think of you. It was a turquoise shirt, unusual for a college shirt. Did you choose the rainbow ensemble?
I hear there is a lot of alcohol at Carleton. 
How are you???
I ordered a 23andme kit lol
!!!!
That is actually incredibly exciting 
Hey
How was your day?
When you first used rainbow ensemble I thought you meant did I chose schools with a vibrant gay community, lol
But yes, I chose the rainbow bodysuit for other occasions. Not Halloween. It might come in handy for drag troupe club :P
I want to do a capella!
Yeah I heard there was a lot of alcohol there too, and it's easy to go to parties on both the Carleton and Olaf campuses. We shall see.
Apparently performance enhancing drugs are huge too
I'm stoked for the 23and kit
What if it turns out I'm like 75% native 
Tell me about you
I'm here
Gonna get a beer
Might act a little queer
But have no fear
Don't even shed a tear
Because I'm not near
You can send pics of your rear
Ok I give up bye
What
Just got on phone lol
What are you gonna wear for Halloween?
It's not even soon lol
My day was very ok. I missed an appointment but it's not a big deal. I bough two sweaters and an ID holder. I had some good pasta but I ate too much. One of my viruses grew, the other didn't.  
I missed a homework cos I just joined a class, but one homework is excused
It's cold but I wore a jacket 
(65 not that cold)
Omg if you are super native put it on your app
Performance enhancing?!?
A survey that came out today said that 18% of brown students and faculty (including grad students) are gay. So probably 25% of undergrads lol
I'm so stoked for 23andme
I'll send rear 
Wtf video
Did you open all my snaps
That is what I'm doing rn
You're gonna hate me
I don't think the campus is all that pretty, lol
Like I understand where Diviya is coming from
Aww I miss you too
I felt bad for not replying to you
*earlier
I was assisting with the AIDA set layout and some blocking for one of my solos
You also saw ugly bits
Not the main green
How is Aida looking (not gonna capitalize)
Seeing your face was so nice :)
And your "weirdly visible chest hair"
I want to go all out again for Halloween this year but I'm unsure of how to make it both sexy and over the top
Do you have any idea for yourself?
Oh shit, can't miss another homework then. What class was it for?
Even if I'm 15% native I'm putting on my app, I just want to make sure
What survey is this? Link? It's funny because I'm also applying to vassar (probably won't get in, slightly lower acceptance rate than Carleton) mainly because of their gay population
Yeah, like pills to help students focus in class and for exams hahaha
A popular saying is that Carleton students study hard and party hard
Yay for rear 🍑🍑!!!!!
I appreciated your snaps so much :)
Aida is looking spectacular. Sonja is our costume lady, Cameron is the musical director, Brauer is the choreographer
There are pirouettes and jumps and running in the dances 
Can you believe I sing two songs all by myself
And then for Not  I'm a singing narrator 
I think I'm just gonna buy a hat and drink for Halloween
#college
It's for basically calc AB. It's so easy that it's hard
Lol is that why you bought the kit
Ew Breuer
Brauer
She's a complete diva
When she is stressed 
Goddamn!!!
Little slug 🐌
Today during CC
me: hey Winkelman, so as my college counselor I thought you should know I got into the Carleton fly in
Him: oh congratulations! Uh.... What is Carleton?
Ok I mean kinda. It's definitely a huge diversity plus. Gay Native American from Arizona
lol no, you can't use #college because that was the Halloween we had last year
I'm still going to dress up no matter how old I am
I want to be that person who hosts Halloween parties 
I still can't find where it gives the percentage of gay students and faculty 
Screenshot it?
She seems pretty cool so far. 
What are you doing right now?
I'm at a model in meet 
I've started reading Catcher in the Rye :)
Ah ok sorry have fun
I didn't know you made it
Will respond in a bit
What a cute thing
Gonna call around 9 your time
What did I wear last year?!?
Did I wear anything???
I want to go to a theme party
I'm working on math HW now
I'll call then!
Haha you were boy George! Remember!!
You had Madeleine do your makeup 
I want to attend a vicar and tarts party
I have a test and a reflection due tomorrow, so if I can't talk today I promise to talk to you tomorrow! 😘
I drive myself to school tomorrow so talking in the morning is definitely possible
I've never talked to this kid before in my life
Will call in 20
Lol wtf
Would morning work better for you?
Lol no 
Actually perhaps.
Like 7:30 your time
Yeah that's a time that works for me
I'll probably be driving
I feel bad :(
Hope you're doing ok 
I'm doing great, I just had hella sudden homework
That was surprisingly hard
Alrighty well glad you finished it
What is vicar and tarts
Alright I am excited to talk to you in the morning!
It means Priests and Prostitutes, so the men dress as members of the clergy and women dress promiscuously 
The pictures make it look fun
It's ultimate objectification of women in a formal setting 
Yes, you too!
Lol that's like the glee episode
With Finn and Rachel
Ahhhh, that one episode with Finn and Rachel 
Lol no ok
Finn was a priest
Rachel was a school girl. They were trying to lose in order to boost the others' ego. And everyone thought it was super offensive (as intended). They sang a love song
Oh yes I remember they got in trouble. I vaguely remember the episode. Of course you went through that weird glee phase recently haha so you would recall that.
I recall a few Rachel schoolgirl moments
Rachel in the first seasons omg fuck that
 remembering something that you don't omg
I try to block out 8th grade, which so happens to be when I watched glee
Today I was thinking about how weird it was that you saw The woman in black with me and Shawn
Like him and I had a movie day together and then invited you for another movie just because
And you were super uncomfortable because you thought I was jerking him off
#ThingsIShouldntRemember
#LongHashtags
Lol those times seem soooo distant
Like I can't even believe you were with him
Yeah I thought it was weird how we worked out
Like it's been a huge roller coaster with us
We as in you and me
No!
I meant with Shawn
Oh oh never mind
Yeah I misunderstood
Yes!
No!
Maybe!
What's weird is how people move on 
It's such a saddening thing
It was beautiful to see in action this week at brown. Bethany liked Adam, then Adam said he wasn't into her, and hooked up with Rufaro, and now Bethany is over Adam. 
Not that the names matter
But the point is that it's empowering in some cases
Lol well its empowering when there isn't much investment or when the investment was not worth your time
Other than that I can't argue for moving on
Yes that's so true
Only because I'm curious
Have you slept with anyone yet?
Niet
That's no
?
That's a no. Correct
Ah okay, I was just wondering
Bethany is Hopkins girl?
No it's cool, I gotcha 
Indeed. 
I didn't know she had the time for hooking up
She's actually chill
AF
"She's like Diviya"
I mean like she is like Diviya without the Diviya moments
Ugh I'm so upset because I feel very conflicted over you
Like she is calm and collected and gets through her shit with a lot of extra socializing time
So she doesn't have time for mistakes
So many things remind me of you :/
And today I made a face when talking to something and Joseph stopped me mid sentence
And he said "nooo!!! What are you doing!!! You know what you're doing. That's an Aimee face"
Because apparently I talk like you and make faces like you, according to everyone around me
Why does Joseph care
That's a good question
What do you feel conflicted about?
I've started feeling uncomfortable with him in regards to you
Like I hate how he's slowly conforming to the girls
Can I message him about it
Today he got super pissed off at Zayna though because she told him not to use the word retarded
Ummm
I would just ask how he feels about what the girls say about him
But then he probably wouldn't give an honest answer because it's AWK on the spot
Also he's at a concert with Jennifer right now
Via email
What will you say?
Idk
I mean honestly I've told him and Jennifer that I love you so he already knows I care and feel uncomfortable 
I'm conflicted about what steps to take with my life and what I want
A powerful thing I could do is tell him that when he says things like that I feel uncomfortable and ask why he says that if you're his friend
I can ask him in the morning if you want
Actually, I will because I'm curious
And it makes no sense to me
I sent him a message
Idk if he will respond but whatever
You can ask him if you want
What did you say?
I'll tell you once he responds 
You know they all think I'm not talking to you
I just feel that it's like between us
After the party
Alrighty cool
No sorry it's not like that
?? No I understand lol
I mean I just feel very saddened
Oh ok
Alright I'll talk to you tomorrow. Kinda depressed lol. It will all be good
That's such a bad way to end the night
You could just not talk to me and not have to hear things like that 
Did I tell you that doug's 4 friends died? 
No I do want to hear
Or I could be more considerate and not tell you
It's really for the best
No no I much prefer it
It's better than blissful ignorance by far
His friends back at home?
Yeah
All at the same time?
In 3 incidents in one weekend
Omg that's terrible! Where is he from?
Connecticut
Ridgefield lol
Were they accidental deaths?
Like two in a plane crash
One in a car accident
Other idk I think health-related 
I feel so uncomfortable right now
(The last one was an adult family friend)
Why?
How has Doug been with you?
Like thinking about deaths
Does he like you yet lol
He's actually really nice and respectful
No he's like over it. So much gay boy tail for him to bark at other than me
Yeah it's tough
Did you tell him about yourself!
?
Like does anyone know?
No....
I told one kid during ADOCH because they came out to me as GQ, but we don't really talk much. 
ADOCH??
ADOCH = my April visit
Ohhhhh hahaha, you can't throw those acronyms at me :P
Anyway
No I gotcha sorry
I'm sorry for keeping you up
No no
I miss you terribly
I miss you, and stability and comfort that was afforded by you. All of it
I see all these trans boys around here and it's so weird. I'm just a normal (possibly gay) guy to them
I missed Popeyes today today and driving you around with my hand down your pants and chicken grease lol
Actually like that pic
*one today
Oh, like they're clearly trans?
Your hand down my pants :(
That must be so sad to transition later in life :(
I always think about how sad that is
Because it's more obvious with older people
Sometimes clearly, sometimes not clearly but I just know because they have the give-aways or the look
Eh they are still young
Do you think they can tell the same way you can with them?
But like 30+ yeah....
I don't think they can
I think about when you come back all the time ughhhhhh
They walk right past me like nothing. No acknowledgment. Actually I seem to repel them cos I seem straight 
today I watched porn (you know what type) and imagined all the crazy things we will do
You know what type
What's the first crazy thing to do?
Priest and schoolboy
We fuck in front of my mom to show our mad love for each other
Also remind me about the butt pics tomorrow, I will make it happen when we call
Right on my kitchen table
Whoaaaaa
Pretty hot tho
Hahah you must be pretty horny to think that's not
*hot
Voyeurism in concept is hot
In practice.... Ehhhh
Aimee, I can't even think about anyone else but you 
Like you have taken over me ever since you've been gone
Hahah voyeurism is ok with someone like Diviya or Reyna 
I am so so so sorry that I haven't been super in-touch. I know, like I really do, how much it must hurt
I think things are calming down now
Like actually actually 
Except weekends are always insane
I've been a little upset but it's times like these (super cliche saying lol) that make it all worth is
*eorth it
Suuuuuper cliche but very true
I heard it rained a lot
Like a lot
True?
What a bunch of Bologna!
Jk, yeah it's rained a lot the past two days
It's all humid and shit
Rained all day today and it's supposed to rain tomorrow
You get snow!!! Aren't you excited 
Ewwwwww humid
Nah it's like month+ away
When I look back on the past year I am so happy to have spent my time with you. Like a lot of my favorite memories were with you.
I guess so but I have to walk everywhere 
And it will be cold and windy and wet
AKA hell
But like opposite, cod it is cold
I cannot think of a way my year could have been better
Lol that sucks so bad! At least all of your buildings (basing this off of snapchat) are pretty close to each other
No
That was me walking 1/5 of the way from class
Walks can be up to 15 min
Well ok more like 10
#SmallLiberalArtsLife
But still
#fucku
#pls
Hahahah :) it was great talking to you tonight
And you reaaaaaaaallly should get to sleep
Bb boy

🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 merica 
Fuck ya
Why a black finger?
Lol
Idk it was just there
You are brown ish
And you finger me
So

Jk lol, goodnight!
🌚
Pic!
Will open in morning
Ok ;)
Goodnight!
Can I call
How much time do you have
I just got out of shower
Unlimited time lol
No class til 4pm
Great! I'll call you in less than half an hour!
:)
 K!
SEND GIF
Already sent
Have a great day :)
You too!
RA smoking again
Constant y'all
Hahaha that gif! That's just what I needed to start my morning. Also I didn't even know dog tongues could be that long.. 😳
I'm surprised you haven't smoked 🌿 yet, or have you???
That's the RA I want to be
Would you ever be an RA?
I'll send you funny tumblr gifs and videos today
I would be an RA maybe, I feel like it ruins social groups. Also super competitive to get in as one
I did once when I was super drunk. I regret 
Gr8!
😘😘😘
Hey how's it going?
Nika came out as trans and gay
Fuck that I'm the one and only
I went to Yom Kippur services. Really damn good here
That's actually so stereotype considering Nika's interests 
Wait how did that even happen
Like publicly?
Hahahah
Also I talked to Joseph and he was super cool about everything and apologized.
Really damn good because of food or the actual services? Like you sat through a sermon?
For us it's the day of atonement. Doesn't that sound so scary, even though it has a beautiful meaning?
Yeah, the way she expressed it though was that it was more genderqueer than anything
She started crying to Zayna in private after the Aida rehearsal 
I stayed after to listen to some music and then Nika started crying in front of the drama teacher, byroad
So she came out in front of me and Zayna and Zayna's brother and byroad
When she was talking about her mom's reaction to the gay thing I started crying 
She's planning on cutting her hair tonight lol
In game theory we fucked around on buzzfeed doing the quizzes during an experiment, and Reyna got in trouble because she was doing "Which Wild Animal is your Sexual Nature" on the school laptop lol
Are you planning to date her
Jk
Actual services, I know I am shocked too
We call it that too when translated to English
Gay thing? Wait wouldn't her mom just consider that straight and thus not problematic?
Lol how did she get caugh
Caught
Which animal did she get
Well she sits next to the aisle so he could see her screen but not mine. She didn't get to finish the quiz lol.
Yeah Nika and I are already a thing. I predicted it and jumped onto that ASAP
Oh goodness. Is this going to be a trend? How important is your Judaism to you now?
Not straight if her mom still considers her a girl
How was that movie of yours? The intern?
Awww remember our sex under a bush
I can't focus on anything but devouring your 🌺
And pounding
Oh as in Nika likes girls
What exactly was said, I'm a bit confused
I don't think Judaism is more important, but I really like the Rabbi. What she says could really be taken from any scripture 
I missed it because services 
Omg the bush
I felt so nature
If only you came in me that time, it would have been complete
Pounding :DDD
Ugh
I'm so sorry
I blame you for not saying good night
I love you, Aimee.
You will always remain one of the best things that has ever happened to me
Welcome to the UA!
Also!!!!
Aimee!!! Omg read my personal statement it's so much better. Like I'm super super super super proud of it
Ike check your email when you wake up and just do a quick read through
 
Hey your essay rocks
Just two little things
"Important occasions became ones I felt uncomfortable linking to my existence." -don't understand this line
And the ending is super short
Hey hey boyfryaaaaaand
Ayyyyyy
What's on your plate today
Also thanks! I feel the same way about that line. I needed some way to conclude that paragraph
The fb link doesn't work, what is it?
And I'll consider the ending
Dinner, because I'm fasting until then.
Omg the gecko :O
Wow Charlotte
It was some video about how a black girl is suing Netflix for getting pregnant from "Netflix and chill." It's soooo dumb lol
Brb shower
Ok :)
I feel bad because one of  the first things my grandpa said to me yesterday when I got home was "you know this is the day of atonement...." All disappointed and shit like he was ashamed of my presence
The gecko is so cute!! He's longing for his partner gecko, the last survivor, off protecting the babies in the depths of New Zealand 
By that sentence I mean that life transitions and important markers became ones that I felt ashamed to experience. Like every kid should tell their parents about their first kiss and their crushes and who they like but I couldn't.
I've forgotten what the holy days signify and it's been less than a year 😯
That's a poignant intention, and I like it. Doesn't quite come across 
Lol is thAt a for real lawsuit? No way
Lol Rosh Hashanah- new year
Yom Kippur- god's sealing the book of like so y'all sinners better repent
Lol when older people try to be trendy
Noooo, it's not real. I remembered I told you I would send funny things and I forgot to, so I rushed to find stuff
According to the video
At least 83% of pregnancies are Netflix and chill and 17% are Hulu and chill because Netflix has "boring selections." The girl and some guy were watching an old movie and she got "dick in her mouth," as she so lovely put it
And you're not eating?
I remember fasting the same day as you last year. Was it today?
No I'm just joking don't worry about the video
I am not eating
I have to worry!!!!!!!!!
Yes it was today
Ok not really
I'm in such a fucked up mood right now
I feel like a crazy person
Why?
I got absolutely no sleep
Whoa
It wasn't my fault though!!!
I took a nap at 7ish and woke up at 10
Couldn't fall asleep until 3:30
Woke up at 6
Absolutely no sleep is an exaggeration 
It's how I feel
Like my mind feels tired and energized if that makes sense
Waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle often feels worse than no sleep
Sort of makes sense
I had a dream we got high together
Like we lived together and got super smashed
Super smashed bros brawl?
Hahah I don't understand why people, specifically the boys, find that game so fun. Rounds and characters start getting repetitive
I have a story to tell you
Right now
So this is about the University of Virginia 
You never told me the Nika story of what she actually said
Oh ok
Yes and I don't get that game either
Rosinbum asked who was interested in going there. A couple of people raised their hand-- Madeleine, but not important. So he said that in the early 1800:, some young men decided to go outside and ride on their horse and shoot their guns. Thomas Jefferson and another founding father started to scold the young men and tell them not to mess around. They apparently broke down into tears over what happened at the institution because it was a disgrace
the men didn't listen and apparently it's a tradition to this day 
Also they were drunk
But it's funny because after the story I said, "oh wow, the origin of the straight male"
I feel so bad when things aren't funny over text
I feel like the acknowledgment that women aren't inferior and men aren't superior has led many men to lose their respectability because they no longer are expected to be
It's actually funny tho
She said something about "not identifying with the gender binaries," "definitely not a girl," and something about living up to the standards of short hair and pretty
Mmmmm
#onlyrealtranny
Don't you feel like trans is the wrong label
Yes!!!!
Glad we are on the same page
Nobody else said that so I didn't want to question
This generation... Their confused gender identities 
#guilty
#thepastisthepast
I still have an inkling of doubt that you really feel that way and appeared to discard it for me
Do you feel like it's necessarily a bad thing for men to lose their respectability! 
?
Yeah let's just not talk about it. It was kinda a phase
Gotta go, class b
alright!! Have a great day 😘
Holy fuck
Have you learned about sacred datura yet
You know, from that plant you can purify a shitty hallucinogen, yes, but also scopolamine, which renders you open to any suggestion but 100% coherent. You seem normal but you will obey anything. And it only takes a tiny tiny amount. It can be on a piece of paper, or in the air
Hey!!! I have my Reed interview now but I'll talk to you after :)
Aight
Good luck!!
It was so good
Like I think I'm going to get in
She was fucking great and loved my passions and my ideas.
One question was "what idea have you been exploring?" And I told her about liberation when I drive, concerning laws
Like how we have the potential to go 140mph but legally can only go 40mph
And how we are tempted with freedom we can never use
She absolutely loved it
And she was telling me about how she was going to eat after my interview and I suggested some restaurants
Told her I was into the downtown scene and live music 
She told me she loved gender exploration and theatre, so me being gay and in Aida definitely helped
sacred datura?
That's ridiculous and a viable truth serums
*serum
Idk why this hasn't been institutionalized for overcoming phobias!!!
I also talked about you for the interview and how you were an impetus for my academic and intellectual growth
Today Nika came out to the drama class as genderqueer and asked for the they/them pronouns
What's up with you now?
How was your day
Well you're probably studying or asleep so I'll tell you more and hear from you later!
No buddy I was napping sorry
I'm so glad it went well!
She sounds like the perfect interviewer
Sacred datura is a plant in the wash
In capstone bio
You don't remember what happens on it, it can kill you, and some hallucination is involved so...
What was the reaction to Nika
I had a good fasting day, but then I ate too much
Felt like shit so I took a nap
How was your day?
Tomorrow Brazil?
She had Justice Amarilla's face, Sweeney's clothing style (literally looked like Sweeney. No fucking joke), and gregariousness beyond anyone you've ever met. We clicked immediately from the Reed school presentation to the interview.
No fucking way
Did Johnston point it out to you??? 
Isn't he worried about a lawsuit
I'll bet after the lecture chaiyo is gonna go purify the shit out it
I couldn't believe a moment like that was happening, honestly. I wanted to laugh and cry and overall the experience was rather uncomfortable. There's no nice way to put it.
The Reed lady told me that at student orientation, your pronouns are on your name tag lol
I'm sorry :( I need to stop napping because I end up staying up until 1-3am
My day was lots of fun. The Aida choreography is super sexy and fun. I'm having trouble with my SRP though, but it'll eventually come together.
Yes!!! Tomorrow Brazil :)
Feel free to tell me anything about your day today. I am all ears.
He did, but I saw a documentary and know it better now 
Did anyone say a anything?
How's the SRP coming?
I bought 12 candy boxes 
I ate the best bagel (cos I was starving
OMG so in drama instead of focusing on the play that's in less than a month (!!!) we are now going around and giving compliments for half the class period. 
)
People said she was brave for it. I said I loved how she made me feel comfortable on the stage and that she's a great director.
Also Garrett is adorable
And Sam Nardi really has self esteem issues
He's super hard on himself and it makes me sad
What's the documentary called?
SRP is frustrating because Pima has no social justice components whatsoever, and their Judaic studies program ended in 2008 lol
So I'm going to do a comparison of northeast schools 
12 candy boxes!!' Why is that???
the French class was throwing a baby shower for Madame, but she had a doctors appointment that day and wasn't coming back to basis because she's super preggers
So I got free leftover bagels lol
Thanks to Vina
Yes I agree with all of those statements about drama people
It's called world's most dangerous drug (vice)
Why Pima?
Lol make sure brown be on top
It was on sale but somehow I didn't get the sale price??
With card 
How preggers she be?
Go vina girl 
Hahahah
Is there a link or can I just look that up?
Again, college drama is terrifying for me
The world seems to become so cutthroat 
I chose Pima out of convenience lol... But it actually sucked so bad
She be preggers enough for maternity leave lol
I can't wait to watch the movie with you tomorrow :)
I'm sad though because I have no earphones with a microphone, only those clunky headphones
You'll still be able to hear me though
The guy in my family who killed the cat volunteers at a computer refurbishment center and got a free laptop and modem, so my mom is considering volunteering there so I "have a backup computer for college"
Also she's like already wanting to go buy a refrigerator and all sorts of shit as if I'm leaving tomorrow
I see you opened and replayed my snapchat sex hahaa :)
Hopefully butt tomorrow
It's really not so bad. Kids are nice 
Hahaha it's ok on the headphones
That's nice of her though
Like super sweet
Enjoyed the 🍆
Hopefully?! You BUTTer!!
Great! I'll watch the doc in the morning
Am super exhausted
I also think it's sweet, but it's funny how she has no clue about the process. She sends me scholarship links all the time.
Wow so you didn't like the selfies 
That 2 😘
Lol what's your bedtime situation
I've been watching so much ftm porn
Ftm sounds like some really powerful acronym
Full throttle machinery
Forced to matriculate 
Fuck the matriarchy
Floss those molars
The last one is probably most relevant (fuck the matriarchy)
But floss those molars most relevant to me
Gonna need to sleep in the next 20 mins but not yet
There isn't even much ftm porn out there
What is the best ftm porn?
OMG there's this one that looks exactly like us
I'm not even kidding
Link?
Like when it shows it rubbing around it it looks exactly like us
It's the exact amount of hair you have and your skin color
I've watched it probably 9 times in the past three days
I just replay certain parts
Ya that's really hot
Though we don't look anything like them lol
I think the entrance does
Not the faces lol
The penetration
Ew so much hair
Makes me feel like shaving
Oh I love it so much
Is there a limit for you?
Big fan of the entrance I feel
Limit?
To how much hair you can have
I meant I love the hair
I thought you were all about them follicles
I mean I can have as much as I want it just makes me uncomfortable, the butt hair especially
On others or yourself?
Others it's fine
I think it's strange how he has two bare spots on his butt
Like at the end of his inner thigh
Anyway I think when I'm older I'm gonna buy ftm porn
Because I can't settle for clips
I do need the full report on each individual in my porn though
Are they vegetarians
Lol did not notice
HahahahahahahahahhahahahHaha
Were they raised in an abusive household?
Lol I can't believe Mady works at a strip club
Is that how that argument started?
Bb gotta crash sry
No don't worry!!!
I was waiting for you to fall asleep
So that I could :)
Good night!!!👻👬😎🇸🇪🐢
Awww
It's not even 10 tho lol
Lol yeah but I'm tired as shit
Aight well
That's great then!
Sleep well
Goodnight 🐌😘🎓🚻👨‍👨‍👦
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Have a great day!! 🐝
6:30 your time?
Maaaaybe.. My mom invited my fucking scout master over to talk about my eagle project WITHOUT TELLING ME
Lol ok
It's fine we can do on Monday or Sunday
This upcoming Sunday?
How was your day today?
Yes this Sunday
My day was interesting. I worked out! Wimpily
My phage died on 12/14 plates but that's ok because it lived on on two of them, both strains. Turns out we got two bad batches of bacteria from the lab
I have no tennis shoes so I ran in converse
Doug offered me his but they were ugly
I just want a nicer back, is that too much to ask?
That's awesome! I thought you judged me for cardio though and that was the reason why you never came with me when I invited you.
Hahahah did you take pictures of any of that?
How can you tell that they're dead and what were you doing to keep them alive
Lol I never came cos I'm a weak ass bitch
But my back and legs hurt from walking around campus with a backpack all day so I need to work out
I can send a picture of my back...
So ok
We knew there was likely a bacteria issue
So basically
You do these dilutions-- one plate is full (1) the next is 10^-1, then 10^-2 etc. because you don't know how much virus there is. 
we all did the 10^-1 in triplicate with three different bacteria batches because it seemed that might be the issue
And it was the issue. 
My phage grew on the two plates from the 9/11 batch, but not the other batches 
So the phage you can tell it grows when there are these clear dots in the bacterial field
Because the viruses killed all the bacteria there
I meant a picture of your phage
Oh, I could maybe do that tomorrow... I'll see what I can do. 
Turned out I didn't really meet with the guy
He came over for a few but I was free
You didn't reply though so I didn't want to bother you
Have you done a similar experiment in your time at basis or no?
No no
Ugh that's too bad
If you would have told me earlier I would have been able to do it tonight
You should have totally "bothered" (wouldn't have actually bothered) me
Lol no at basis we grew bacteria
Now we are killing it
By isolating viruses from the soil
Which is MUCH more labor-intensive
Basically what we did on Wednesday is take virus that was already growing on the plate, and put it on another plate to make more. We put the virus into some bacteria and then poured that mix into some hot gel, and then poured the gel on a plate and let it incubate
I'm sorry to hear you are having a tough time this week
Do you want to talk about it
I'm just so sad because everyone already has their established cliques and people. Whenever I'm upset with the Zayna group for their bullshit (I can't even begin to tell you what's happened this week) I can't go to anyone because Diviya and Nate go off the moment lunch starts and Martha is in love with her boys
I feel so lonely because nobody cares to bring people together
the only person I could talk to this week was Sam Nardi
What happened this week?
Who are Martha's boys?
And I fucking miss not being able to tell you anything 
I miss you so much every single day
I can't even express that enough
I think it's so sad that the group we cobbled together is fragmented
What about Reyna?
She often misses school because her mom doesn't drive her and we don't really have classes together
:(
Martha is trying to work things out with Ahmad again
my biggest fears are that you're going to not have any time for me, or fall for someone else, or tell me you're not interested in talking to me. I know you say that things like that won't happen, but it's not unlikely. And I know that once I get to college later I'll be having a great time and making lots of friends, but obviously dealing with the now is very important to attaining the freedom of going where I want to go.
It's not specific to this week, but it's a general sentiment of loneliness no matter who I hang out with
It's a sentiment of admiring memories you will never make again with the people you're around
It's a sentiment of seeing people you were so close to not give two shits anymore
It's a sentiment of knowing that within months they will be faces in a yearbook
And it's a sentiment of longing for the people I grew up with, who are now miles away
It's my mother getting upset with me over not applying for scholarships (???)
Anyway this is just really lame on my part and I'm sorry
Excuse me
I really need to find a better way to deal with this. I've been talking and hanging out with new people not at basis to ease up my life
But I am glad to hear that you're doing well and making friends
Zayna called me a pathetic and weak person, and said that her and others have no respect for me because I still talk to you
And that she wants me to unfriend you on Facebook "or else"
This was yesterday
I really do understand what you are going through
It is completely normal
And I think there is a lot of added stress you have that I don't
I think I dealt with it much like you did, with internal sorrow
Not so much at the general loss
But the fragmentation 
What's up now?
How are you doing
But thank you, I appreciate your help. It's a little strange because obviously you're over the phase I'm going through.
I'm at a party actually 
I was gonna sleep
But this happened
Yeah I'm sorry, it's hard from the outside
Oh ok well have fun
Ok well I'll talk to you later then goodnight
Sorry b :(
Good night
I hope we watch the movie ASAP, it's unfortunate about tonight. I was so ready to watch it
Lol this morning we went through the AP biology immunology lectures + more material in 50 minutes 
Like it condensed 2 weeks into less than an hour with more material 
What's up
Do you feel like those fast paced lectures are effective for retention purposes and understanding?
Personally I love learning through narration 
I'm getting ready for partying
Nina's applying early action to Hampshire
Anyway, have a good rest of your night
No no
I don't know how effective they are yet
I love these-- My apologies.
The drama class said I was open-minded, inspiring, accepting, "chill", fashionable, a strong actor, and according to Nardi, "one of the most genuinely kind people he has ever met"
llow and chill were used a lot lol
And I have a great smile and cute dimples, which was an embarrassing thing to end on
I don't mean to sound vain, but I'm so happy to know that the people I admire and respect so much feel that way about me
 
Such good pics 
Why Hampshire? All the hippy schools for that dam
How was your day!
Fam
Tell me all about it
I don't care if you give me the most mundane details
I want to know
In what context did they say that?
I will let you know, text me in like an hour, I'm at a party again :(
Ah ok, goodbye
?
Sorry I'm still out :(
Alright
What's up?
Did you see the news out of Hampshire?
What happened
They stopped accepting ACT and SAT scores entirely
Which is pretty cool!
Oh yeah, I knew about that long ago
Oh, how's it going??
Pretty good wbu
?
Are you ok?
I'm just upset id rather not talk
I'm tired
Alright :( well if you want to talk, I'll be back from Boston around 9:30 your time
I'm headed to Harvard for a football game
Hope to talk to you later
Ok have fun
Like seriously, I really do hope you have a great time. I look forward to talking to you later.
😛🎃🐢
Two kids from Salpointe are on Brown football
That's kinda impressive
How did you find out about them?
They were on the program!
 on my first day of kindergarten
How is Boston? Has the game started yet?
Do they even have a huge stadium 
Yeah we are losing 37-0 now
At halftime
It's alright, I mean we haven't gone out yet
Like it was just train and subway to Harvard 
No their stadium is very average
She lost so much weight!
Lol at first I thought you were saying the stadium lost a lot of weight 
So much for being proud of Tucsonans on the team lol 
Lol!
Hahaha they weren't the worst of the players though
Have you taken any pictures?
 
I miss going to UA football games, where it rained while I ate my hotdogs and cheered from the bleachers
I didn't know what I was cheering for though
It's poorly lit on campus so I can't take many good photos
It was one of the only times I got along with Richie's dad
How often did you go
That's such a small stadium!
It looks like there's barely anyone there in all but the first pic
It's 30K seats lol
Those are the side sections tho
Rest is full
Alrighty well have fun and let me know when ur free
To talk and all that
Will do
Can you show me what the subway looks like!
Will do! I'll be in it in 20
:)
Will call in 15
Oh I didn't expect to call
Oh, do you want to?
It's ok if not, I could call tomorrow
Tomorrow I will have a ton of time
My phones almost dead
Alright, that's fine I understand!
It's like 13% and if I wanted to talk I couldn't use a charger 
But yeah
Tomorrow would be cool
Alright! 
Are you alright?
Yeah 
Has there been something on your mind or whatever
No I just was glad to not be the limiting factor
For what?
What do you mean
Are you going to sleep now
For contact between us
Yeah I'm gonna go to sleep soon
I mean idk
There are just feelings and things I can't describe
Or don't feel comfortable describing 
I'm gonna perform for an open mic night on Friday at the school lol
Anyway it's so late where you are
Goodnight
Mm ok
Goodnight
If you're upset you can just tell me
I am frank
Sorry that was accidental, my roommate is drunk 
?
I'm so confused 
He just took my phone I don't even know
So are you actually going to sleep now then
What is even hallening
Yes lol
Are we ok?
From my perspective, yeah. What about yours?
I'd like to believe that much
So that's a yes, I guess
I've just been unstable but my general feelings haven't changed
Still like you a lot, still miss you a lot
I do find it a bit unhealthy for myself
I think we should talk about it tomorrow 
Ok
Hey what's up?
Hey hey I'm gonna be at the farm later today 
What's up with you
I might see a movie at the loft 
Aren't you concerned about your sleep schedule
Hi
I napped some more lol 
What movie?
I'm not too concerned, the sleep works out enough so far
?
I'm free from now more or less until I go to sleep in 8 hours, I was hoping to spend a portion of that time with you
It's called Phoenix. I think it's about a holocaust survivor working in Germany after she got plastic surgery 
Well that's good!
I was hoping that it didn't mess you up yet
Ok well I'll be home around 5pm if I don't see the movie tonight
5 your time or my time?
My time...
And if I do see the movie then probably 8pm my time
Aright I'll plan for 8 your time then
Did you see Aodhan's post? 
I'm conflicted 
She's not even on hormones in the locker room... I don't even go in locker rooms 
Not that they should be yelling at her, but I don't know that I support her using the women's locker room
I'm sorry! I forgot you texted me
Well it's a matter of comfort I think. Everyone feels different about their body. 
The reason I'm so comfortable with mine is because I value opinions about things I can change 
Today I was actually seriously thinking about nude modeling once I turn 18
I totally want to help art and photography students in need of inspiration or models
Oh shit
Wow
I didn't even read the second half of that text 
Ok disregard that all
Yeah, idk either, but that's touchy
Can't discriminate but also want the girls to feel comfortable 
Ok anyway
Wait what did you think I said??
I feel stupid so just ignore me
I thought you were conflicted about yourself in locker rooms
Ohhhhhh
Lol
How was your day??
Like I thought you meant you felt conflicted because she was comfortable so why couldn't you be too?
My day was a lot of fun. I'm currently considering the movie
How was yours?
Actually, I feel bad about being so vague recently 
Even though I'm usually not
Yes I have been thinking about that
I'm just coping 
And I guess that means trying to detach myself 
Today when we talk I want to chat about getting you out of this cycle and how we can do that
Because I feel like it's gonna happen and I was trying to make it easier
So that we can be in contact, and you can be happy
It's pointless for me to ramble on about things that happened when you won't even reply for hours
I feel as though much of your discontent stems from a fear that I will not talk to you like ever and I won't enjoy your presence is my life, and that any time we don't talk much for a day it is representative of that
I think that is one reason
I always read it though
I do get to it
And it does matter to me
It's not a lot to do with how often you talk to me, but whether or not you enjoy doing it and you even like me anymore
* and if you
I do enjoy it immensely
It grounds me. I need it
There have been moments where I didn't feel wanted or anything, and I'm sorry for letting the small things consume me
The reason I haven't been wanting to watch a movie or call you is precisely that
How can I fix that 
In a realistic way
How can I get you out of this cycle
That seems to be a very negative force upon you
I think it's helpful to just say what you feel
Like express yourself to me no matter what time of the day it is
Alright, I'll try t
To more when I have any free time
But I don't get like
We call, it goes great, you seem happy
And within 2 days it devolves
Then eventually call again and fix things 
Then continued devolution 
How can we reach stability
Well this has a lot to do with myself, but
I felt that way when I texted you after school and you told me to text you back in an hour, and then that you were still out so you couldn't. That made me sad, but I feel like I need to get over that and move on because you need space
Move on from feeling sad about things like that, I mean
see that's hard for me because
Because you do need your freedom
One one hand I want to text you, on the other hand things evolve and times change, and I don't want to tell you I won't be free for 5 hours
I just don't think text is the best method for me anymore as it was in high school because
Almost all of my time is spent with other people you know? It's rude to be texting 
I love when you send me links and things and tell me about your day, but in terms of conversing seriously, phone is way better 
Because my ability to text is all over the place (also it's getting cold and it is hard to type with cold fingers lol)
Not to say texting is not good right now, it is because I'm free 
You should go see the movie btw, it sounds wonderful
I already missed the showtime. I'm planning on going with people later this week though
Kinda upsetting but oh well :(
Just a min -- didn't forget you I promise
:( I made plans anticipating that you would go... So I'm gonna be busy here in just a minute
Alright
Oh ok then nvm
Don't worry about it
I didn't go because I didn't want you to wait
I wanted you to go
Shit
No you can say what you want to say though
I will read it
Ok I'm going at 7pm
What were you up to
Playing video games so not much, you finished the movie?
Yeah it ended a while ago but I thought you would let me know when you were back
So that's why I didn't say anything hahah
What do you play?
Lol I've just been aimless for a while. It's civilization 5, we have a unit group
Was the movie goodb
?
After the movie I sat in parking lot in my car and considered masturbating to get that piece of shit film out of my head 
It was called Queen of Earth
Maybe I'm not a true artist or whatever to understand how it was reviewed the way it was, but it made absolutely no sense and relied on imagery to give details
About some depressed woman who goes crazy after a breakup and her father's death, so she stays at her friend's vacation home and it's about her downward spiral
The plan was to see that and drive to el con for The Intern but I was too disappointed 
That's so cool that you found people to play with! Remember when you tried teaching me? Hahah
Also, idk if you remember that iTunes gift card cal got me for my birthday? I bought a civilization game to learn how to play, but it wouldn't download because my internet kept crashing
That's probably the worst review of a film I have ever heard
I do remember! At black crown
Awww!
Is the Intern popular?
I wish I had fallen asleep during the movie haha and I was so cold on the couches
People got up and left!
Tbh I'm only seeing the intern because there's nothing else out 
Also I've been meaning to get back to movie watching. I started Sleepy Hollow a few days ago and loved what I saw
I heard Let's Get it On for the first time today
How are you feeling, sir?
When we talk I need to tell you the story of Martha's party 
It was ridiculoussssssss
Like two awful things happened
I can't believe I never played that song for you
What movies have we left from?
I was thinking about that today!
That three floors up movie because of your bass lesson
I'm still mildly sick
But overall WAY better
Omg what's the story?
And that one with Carey mulligan, far from the madding crowd
Aww :( that movie was good
Haha we said we would come back to watch it 
So story #1:
I walk into Martha's house, everyone greets me and is excited to see me. Martha's parents come out from their room and invite me to have food. As I'm dipping my pita bread into the hummus, Martha's mom starts with "so I heard what you told Oscar..."
Goes on about how upset she is and how it was rude of me in literally the bitchiest tone ever
And Martha's defense was "my mom's insensitive sometimes. She doesn't know what she's saying"
Story #2
We're having a good time at the pool. It's Madeleine, Keizer, Carly, keagan, Wyatt and I lounging on the poolside chairs. Some kids come to the pool, ok cool, whatever, and their parents come along. after about half an hour one of the grandparents comes up and asks which one of us lives there. We point to Martha, and he says that she can only have 5 guests and tells us to leave
Then Diviya, the smart ass that she is, tells me "where is your social justice! This is teen discrimination. Tell him something"
So what do I do?
I mean the guy was holding the gate open for us while drying off and barking at us to "hurry up!!! Get out of here! Only 5 guests!!"
Of course I was the only one who told him off and he threatened to call the cops on specifically me
Madeleine starts crying, Martha starts screaming, Diviya starts yelling at me and says "I can't get arrested now"
So I just left the party early
Then once I left people messaged me apologizing for the way they acted
This was a mean old veteran man who took Martha's key from her hand to "test it out" to see if we didnt just hop the fence, and I called him out for teen discrimination 
I'm sorry you're sick :( you have been under the weather for a pretty long time! 
Good thing you're taking naps
Also, I'm not exaggerating when I say Madeleine was crying... She started kicking shit and going bananas
Anyway, those were two things I meant to tell you over the phone, but I hope the texts captured the emotion I was looking for :)
Those are so riiculous
I also went to the farm today and guess who works there? Jesse Gilmer!
He's missing teeth and he has long hair now
Super hippie 
What do you mean she started kicking shit?
This is so suburban
It's like portlandia but suburbia
How did it end with Martha's parents?
It totally was
Missing teeth though?!?
Lol I thought the same thing too about suburbia!!!! I was gonna say "only at community homes"
Like Madeleine started crying and saying "I can't go to jail now! Who's gonna bail me out!!! My mom has no money!" And ran around kicking trees in the parking lot and the walls of the community center
Then she nearly kneed me in the balls
Keagan and Wyatt and I couldn't understand the mass hysteria 
Also I couldn't understand how fucking illogical that old man was
Please never let me be such an asshole!
With Martha's parents it ended with me saying "well there's nothing I can do about it now. I'm looking forward to this year and to graduation"
Then her mom asked me how many schools I'm applying to, and when I told her 16 she said "your parents must be rich"
Fee waivers 😛
Yeah, it's strange. He looks like a 52 year old bum
Imagine rip van winkle 
That seems so unreal
Like wtf
That's doesn't sound like real life 
I looked him up! (I don't know who rip van winkle is) wow....
Not really sure what to say about that
Especially Madeleine
Not really sure referred to Jesse though
Lol did you tell them about the waivers
Her mom had her head too far up her ass to even hear me
lol typical
I'm so pissed
Can you see the chat lol
You know, the personalities in our group are so bombastic 
Oh I meant it as a question
Like not a request 
Haha you didn't know rip van winkle!
Lol oh well
I can't believe Martha is defending you this fervently
she quoted her dad on me 
Did his complaint result in any issue or anything for her parents? 
Idk but they hate me now, which is fine
Did they just find out about it now?
Lol no, they've been upset about it since summer according to Martha 
"It's times like this when you see what people are really like" - my dad at breakfast this morning when we were talking about this
Yeah I saw that
She's being super mean
To you
Even if I get her angle she doesn't need to be so mean about it
Like I can't understand why she can't see my motivations and the fact that I was drunk
It's not like I got joy out of telling him that
I comforted him after it
Idk it's the kind of thing that hurts all involved
And while it was wrong in some respects, I have no regrets
Like yes it's the truth but it's not a constructive truth 
He's gonna grow from it somehow
Maybe it made him work harder? Maybe?
But he was emotionally crushed 
At least he didn't change his major
What are you still doing up haha?
I'm just laying in bed lol
I see what you're saying though, it's a tradeoff
Lol are you laughing at the arguments
I would be if I were watching this
Internally
It's like reality TV
Because roomy is asleep
It truly is
I miss you
It's weird to see drama from the outside
I missed cuddling next to you during movies 
It's sooooo childish and ridiculous 
The other thing I'm thinking is
I enjoy Martha and I'm overall not upset with her, but everyone tolerates her ridiculousness and not mine?!?
:( I miss cuddling in general, like spooning after parties
"So girls do mature emotionally way before boys! Huh"
Lol yeah, I can't even deal with this right now
I cuddle with people but they're only friends and it's not the same
Can't squeeze butts :(
I still love you 
And I hope you've been having a good time
Here's a scary video  🐻
Omg that video
Omg
Got dat fat ass
I hope you are doing ok with all the turmoil
Surrounding you
Honestly I think you are more principled (American) and Martha is more practical (European)
We talked about that this week in relation to burqas in schools, the Spaniard was hella pissed
Anyway
I hope you are having a good night
I hope we are through this weird period we were having
I hope you share how the drama and all else turns out
even through the period my feelings for you have not changed 
My week is over. New cycle 
Lol you need to tell me about how that discussion turned out
Aimee
Do you still like me
I feel silly asking
I want you in my life now and forever, I am so happy to hear from you!
Romantically?
Currently
Yes
Ed same
I feel as though it's hard for me to categorize it as romance because so much of that to me is the physical presence- going to places, sharing a life together, sex. I feel deeply connected to you, in a way that I think would be romantic were I to return at any point
Yeah, I agree. Although for me I'm fine without NEEDING to do those things to love you, because I know that there is nobody else I would enjoy doing with them more than I would with you. 
*doing them with 
Anyway, thank you 
Thank you, I'm glad we had a proper chat
💖😊👻🍑🐢🌚
 too :$
:)
🇸🇪🐢🍆🆒☀️🇮🇱🌚
Have a great day 😘
WTFFFF
My Uncle returns to his childhood street in Morocco 55 years later 
With his wife 
Just saw a guy in a st Olaf tee
That looks like a scene from a movie, it's so beautiful
Where does he live now?
Agh what's with all of this Minnesota college love at brown?
How was your day today? :)
Even just reading St. Olaf in that sentence gets me excited for when I go to Carleton 
He lives in Jersulaem
Jerusalem
Idk I think they are the most proud of their state
Like I know two Minnesotans personally 
My day was very fine, straightforward class, virus died. Oh well
When are you going again?
Is telling a girl she's probably compensating for something when talking about something big usually directed towards her boobs?
lol I know a Minnesotan too and she actually made it clear that she was from there
I'm going oct 29-31st and I have my interview the 30th. They have a house specifically for fresh-baked cookies
And we get to tour the arboretum 
I'm going to the coffeehouse meeting thing that you went to last year
It's at raging sage this year
Awwww hahah too bad. Did anyone's virus do better or significantly worse than yours?
Also it's funny because according to college niche whenever people get bored of Carleton kids they just go over to the st. Olaf events and parties
Hm, Minneapolis has the 4th highest LGBT population, behind San Fran, Seattle, and Atlanta
 
Can you believe this!!
Anyway hope you're having a great evening
Just got out of UN, sorry!
The president looks and acts just Kittles 
Will respond more in a sec
Walking back
Not clear what the boobs comment means
Omg I told you the Carleton lady was from Uzbekistan right
So it wasn't my fault, again
The bacteria developed a strong cell wall as a result of stress in all but one sample in our group so
Surprised Minneapolis is ahead of Chicago
And NYC
unless you mean percentage wise
Omg noooo on the teeth
Just woke up haha
Is that the president of UN? He does!! Kittles used to be cute just like that back in the day
They share the same level of charm
Yes haha and they meshed together because he wasn't the straightedge science majors tend to be
That's such an interesting experiment! It's funny how many of the problems were problems with the stuff you received rather than your doing
Oh yes, it was percentage wise
How has MUN been? Like are you an active participant in it?
Lol he's chubby (not as chubby) like Kittles and same humor it's amazing 
Yeah he's president 
Did you see last night's blood moon 
It has been ok... Like today was the first real meeting. I feel kinda inferior because they are mostly International Relations people who are super politically knowledgable, and it was about the pope which I also didn't have much unique to say about but they forced us (mostly) to speak in small groups so I just sounded uninformed 
It's chill tho
And I am a director for their high school conference, on the Lebanese parliament (not one of my top 3)
I did, it was ok
Kittles also used to be that chubby. Today I was thinking about which one of my classmates will have beer bellies or just have a belly in general and which of us will still be attractive like xochitl's dad
Like general attractiveness later on in life
I felt that way when I was in MUN too because your phrasing and solutions to problems seemed to be prepared things. Because you all had done it before you had things to draw from.
It was funny because at the farm, Raad's brother was there (he's kinda doltish. Today I found out he got a 6% in a class)
And one of the adults randomly asked "guys... What do you think of the pope??" And Rabiah answered "he's a cool dude. My mom talks about him all the time"
That should've been your answer!
No but seriously I'm in love with him. He went to visit victims of sexual abuse, which included male victims!!!
That's some of the first public acknowledgement I've ever seen
That's awesome! Make sure not to write any stupid, suggestive notes to Lebanon hahah
No no lol
I am Lebanon 
Like
Ok
I am creating the background guide 
For the committee
And like co-chairing 
See! I really don't get how this thing works hahah
😁
How was your day?
Something about my day was particularly interesting but I can't quite put a finger on it. I nearly finished my Macalester supplement. Bella, all on her own, asked her sister to take pictures of the campus for me. That was a really sweet thing for her to do.
In research class we read a pew research center article on immigration and when he asked for initial thoughts I said, "what saddens me is that my grandchildren may not get affirmative action" because according to the article whites are slowly becoming the minority. The class loved that comment haha
Also we all failed 5th grade geography (well- Madeleine and I did) because we mixed up damn Mississippi and Arkansas and Georgia!!!
I really just had so much fun today. Got to get my Doritos after school, which is always a great thing
One frustrating thing though is that Keizer bases his future academic career around financial aid and not what the school has to offer socially or academically. Like at every college visit his only question is finances, and schools with the best package are at the top of his list
Idk like for me that's one of my least concerns. We're all different though.... Sigh
As you can probably tell, I had a great day and I can't shut up hahah
For the school staff meeting today, the teachers had to complete a buzzfeed quiz (super credible? Am I right?) that would give them a color. They were then to group off because the quiz told them about their personality and then Ms. Paradis would lecture them on learning styles or whatever. It's just so dumb because instead of letting the teachers go home early and saying "well, we have nothing meaningful today" the admin decides to keep the date
Also today Was "dress as your favorite teacher" day and Mr. Casler donned the best Wohlford drag
Makeup, earrings, tank top, everythaang
I actually have another story to tell you but it's better over phone or Skype
Azealia Banks today on Twitter lol (according to Facebook news): "LGBT community are like the gay white KKK's. Get them some pink hoods and unicorns and let them rally down rodeo drive."
Ok I'm done lol
Also Aimee I love pictures of any and everything!!!
So please do send pictures no matter what
LOL I thought I caused you to learn the states
I think Keizer's method really makes more sense than anyone's because most colleges are going to offer a similar experience regardless. Cost is the differentiating factor
Lol that's such a millennial approach, buzzfeed quizzes 
She doesn't wear makeup or tank tops though?
I'll try to think of things to photograph
As my day goes on
You day sounds so good!
Not as good as it would've been if you were here
Jk lol 
I mean not jk but jk in the depressing sentiment
I shouldn't have even said that because I was pretending to be all sweet and gushy
Well, you caused me to learn CAPITALS! Hahahah. The south is always gonna be rough to learn, idk. The way I explained it to the class is that I basically just know of the west coast stages, the east coast, some of the Midwest, and then all the others I can't identify are racist 
Which is pretty ignorant, but I'm working on it
Well, he has some ultra conservative schools like hillsdale and then moderately liberal ones like Macalester. If there's anyone I can confidently say is even not ready for college it would have to be him.
Lol i know right? Where are these millennial approaches for this year's class of 2016? Hmm? You guys got breakfast and assemblies and movie days and we get nothing because Chris and Elliot vandalized wohlford's house 
Well it was a sleeveless dress actually, my bad. Still funny, regardless
Okay :)
Macalester is liberal AF tho
Which is so not Keizer
This is a direct quote from him
"When I grow up I don't want my children to go out. I'm gonna be a fairly conservative parent. They need a strong catholic background"
Lol you guys actually get nothing?
It's so sad, it's clear that he has internalized his homophobia and is compensating
We've had nothing. We haven't even taken class pictures...
I really hope he ends up growing and becoming more confident because it's gonna fuck him up soon if he can't
His best friends are joann and vina, two of the most insecure and shy people I know
I can't believe I just recognized that!
Sergio's therapy skills 101
 today
Just realized what?
You're right though, he would be miserable in college at this rate
You look so tall and happy hahaha
Sergio
You NEED new glasses!
Just realized that he only hangs around insecure people :/
Wire frames are so unflattering on everyone, you could be doing so much better!!! You are so cute already, why inhibit yourself???
I know I know hahah! Before I leave for MN I'm actually planning on getting myself some new glasses. I'll send you pictures and you can help me :)
I've been wearing some of my new clothes I got from savers. It's awesome because my mom was in the store and she also gets my discount, so when I was putting items away and if I liked it, I "put it away" (I went over to her and put it in her cart lol)
Aimee omg I love you so much
Even though you can't categorize your connection for me as romance anymore I am so enamored with you
Ahhh!!!!
😘😘😘
I am so happy that you are so happy!!!
:)
You're so beautiful
:)
You know it's weird 
My thoughts about high school now
Are mostly that I regret not taking harder classes 
Wish I took AP Chem, Orgo, and more math
Like how much more work would it really have been
And I'm sure I would have done fine 
Do you feel like what you have taken throughout high school has prepared you in any way?
I agree though
I mean sure
I think you are someone capable of being academically successful no matter what the circumstances are 
We all know my regret haha
My single high school regret 
I think I could have been more prepared. Like I did so little work, and I feared doing more for like no good reason. 
I've never worked as hard in my life until this year
But I know I can handle it
I suppose the same is the case at Brown so far, but I am taking two hard classes because I care for them instead of because they were easy
This year as in senior year?
That's great! If you care about it then that's a lot better and more beneficial than just taking it because it's easy
Yes, this year as in senior year
It's just a lot of projects and deadlines and responsibilities with school and my ECs
Did I tell you I'm starting my eagle project Tuesday?
I also need to boost the fuck out of this AIDSwalk because Michael is expecting a full sheet of volunteers
So tomorrow I'm gonna go class to class
I'm looking forward to it though
There's always a reason to stress out about my life right now, but I can choose not to :)
Which two are the difficult classes that you are genuinely interested in?
Phage hunters and infectious disease 
Math I'm taking cos pre-med. I really should be taking 2-3 levels higher, but I don't find math rewarding so
I guess that's why I didn't take it in high school, but now I actually have more fulfilling ways to spend my time
And computer science is kinda culturally interesting in a way I don't think a programming class would be, so I'm happy with it despite the fact that it's a bit of a joke
What's your eagle project gonna be
And how long is it gonna take
I love how when I ask about your day you immediately tell me about how your virus did hahah
Like of all things :P
Really the only highlight
Calculus is one of my favorite subjects, but it's difficult because what can one do with a math degree when he/she doesn't find science particularly interesting?
What do you mean
Like you could do statistics 
Or teaching 
Really! You have to tell me more about this computer science class and about the Spaniard on burqas 
When we phone you will tell your story 
And I will tell about Manu
My eagle project Is kinda exciting. I'm building approximately 5 benches for the Tucson village farm, and then I'm bringing them on farmer's market Tuesday's for the kids to paint :)
Each bench is $75
Wtf
That's a lot
Who pays?
Yeah... I have to do some fundraising and submit discount requests to lowes and Home Depot
When I imagine myself in the future I can see some teaching involved
But I also see so many other things!
It's difficult to pick one
Just the other day I was thinking of doing a nude cultural photography shoot with indigenous peoples
And how my body is no different from theirs even though I've had a western upbringing
Like I was thinking about how I would raise money for this project and shit
This was yesterday I think
Another exciting thing today
!!!! :)
This guy down the hall has come in twice today looking for my roommate's rolling papers 
One was 25 min before our shared calc class
That's actually a really good idea
Like really good
I mean you would have to wait until you turn 18 but yeah
Wow, I had faith in your roommate and thought rolling papers was some academic college term you were gonna explain and then I realized how stupid I was jaha
That's a great way to make $$$
Like rolling papers was some paper kids took turns writing 
What's funny is how much I judge people for doing avant garde art, yet I'm one of the biggest advocates for myself doing it 
You should totally do that when you're 18though 
LOL I'm would never
Public ain't ready for that and neither am I 
But what if this is the gateway to selling your body!!!!
Avant garden I actually like
Wat
You start off by selling papers and then you end up becoming a drug dealer and then on the streets 
It's in the bible, actually
*Bible
Ok no it's not
Pretty sure it is
Maybe haha
Republicans say it is
*avant garden
Whoops
I like avant garden actually as a term
The avant garden
I ought to store that indigenous nude project in my notes for later when I have the resources 
Good name
 too!!!
Like the name of an art exhibit 
I'm gonna steal that someday
When I become famous I'll credit you
And pay me royalties?
Pay you in sex, of course
Money's too precious
Bodies are not
If I ever become famous I want to make all of my friend's dreams come true
Like I would go to my fan base or on the news or whatever platform I had access to, and say "this friend always wanted to do this with their life. Please get in touch with my agent if you can make this happen"
I think about that all the time
Or I would call out ex boyfriends 
LOL 
Call out my biological dad
I think about the shit I would do as a rich and famous person too
Sex > money
What would you do for me?
Or are you not generous enough
I think about what I'd do for you
Did you hear about the sex power God thing at brown (no longer exists)
Hahah no!! Please share!!
Sounds very Diviya
SexPowerGod is an annual Fall party, thrown by the Brown Queer Alliance in the university's Sayles Hall, though in 2006 the venue changed to Alumnae Hall and again to Andrews Hall in 2010. SexPowerGod, while drawing a large segment of Brown and RISD's heterosexual population,[citation needed] also draws a large gay crowd from a number of other New England universities. It was cancelled indefinitely by the Brown Queer Alliance in 2014.[25]
The event is promoted across campus with an often controversial poster and flyer campaign. The posters took on a more graphic feel in 2004, depicting sex acts and BDSM. Publicity featured actual Brown students for the first time the next year.[26] Tickets are sold for $20. The first set of tickets for 2005 was sold out in ten minutes, a line of nearly 200 people remaining. Admittance to the event is limited by the 590-person capacity of Alumnae Hall. Until 2005, tickets came as temporary tattoos that were applied on the body. In 2005, some clever students gained admittance to the party with fake tickets, made from scanned tattoos printed on mailing labels. Since the 2005 debacle, the tickets have been replaced by a guest list to avoid fake tickets and resale of tickets.
In 2009, tickets were sold for $20 each over a period of three days. Ticket sales began at 9 AM, but students who want a chance to buy them typically spend the night in Alumnae Hall. This tradition of camping out to get tickets helps increase the anticipation for the party and guarantees that only those students who have a deep desire to attend are present.
One source of SexPowerGod's fame and notoriety is its unique use of multimedia. Traditionally, partiers have been provided with identifying numbers upon entry, and a large projector screen publicly relays messages by number, typically comments on costumes and propositions for sex.
On November 14, 2005, SexPowerGod was featured on Bill O'Reilly's nationally televised, Fox News show The O'Reilly Factor. Jesse Watters, a producer of the show, gained admission to the November 12 party and shot footage of the attendees.The following day, O'Reilly talked about the party on his radio show, The Radio Factor, saying, "You would have been safer in Baghdad than on the campus of Brown University," and calling Brown president Ruth Simmons and other university leaders "pinheads." On campus, student reaction to the broadcast was generally marked by outrage at what happens at the party mingled with pride at being featured by O'Reilly.[27]
Awww my day keeps getting better
That sounds mad crazy
Can't believe it's that huge of an event
What exactly is the purpose though?
No purpose
Just a big crazy gay party 
Anyway b 
I gotta sleep so
Hahahah
Good night!!!
Alrighty :)
😇👻💩😘🐢
🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢
Ahhhh shit! Lovely
Hahahahah
🐝🎃🌺🌚😘💖
🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
I love you so much
Goodnight!!!
Shit at the grad student who jumped...
The town itself looks pretty until you get to the campus 
Today's spirit day is zombie day lol
You should take a picture of a classroom!
When you're not asleep in your dorm hahah, so enjoy that for now
Damn your RA is so beautiful!
Also, what kind of liquor store closes at 10 lol??
My other two are pretty cool too. One is like if Keizer lost weight and became interesting, and the other is from Phoenix and is cool too
But the one pictured is for sure the coolest
Someone walked around the hall Saturday morning with sunglasses cos hangover and she just burst out laughing at them
Lol the town  only looks like that around campus
Providence is a shithole
Sleeping now tho
I know fuck the liquor store
Lol I thought the glasses thing was a Hollywood myth. I wonder what the hungover eyes actually look like.
Is the Keizer one the guy who commented on trans people?
Ok enjoy your nap! Talk to you later bb :)
Lol the eyes aren't the problem, it's that when you are hungover you are often sensitive to light
No... What comment on trans people? 
#brown sitting next to two black peoples talking about how brown revoking cosby's honorary degree is race related 
The religious guy who said that trans isn't a thing or whatever
Lol that's rape related
How silly
I'm with Diviya and Nate right now because she locked her keys in her car
Diviya: oh... I feel like my cervix is breaking
What's up with you
How was your day
Hey I'll message you in like an hour, I'm working (been working for hours at this point lol)
That's alright! Have fun hahaha
Hi!
I don't recall the religious guy, but this definitely isn't him. I think you mean my floormate Jake, who isn't very religious, just Floridian 
He's recovering though
Did she figure it out
And why was her cervix breaking 
My day was fine, I did a lot of work I didn't need to do. 
I'm 4 weeks ahead on math HW, and now I just need to go back and check the answers (I don't like quotient rule, I just use product rule in its place, so my answers are a bit wonky)
It's a humid hell here
I worked out (mildly)
I biked 5 miles (slowly and without high resistance) and then did some torso exersizes 
Exercises*
I napped for hours in the middle of the day which was beautiful
And I did some phage homework 
So all in all it was a good day 
Wbu?
No no there was someone you told me about your first week at brown who was anti trans
Yeah we had to wait for the AAA guy to come. Her cervix nearly broke because she didn't want the guy to scratch her car, and the tools he was using made his work look dangerous
Ugh god I miss calc homework so much! That was me last year!!
That's awesome!!! Does the video game format help you stay motivated to work out?
Your day sounds glorious
Like all of my favorite things
Sleep and exercise and working
(Fun work though)
My day was actually super frustrating because my back hurt all day from shitty sleep, I didn't feel like going to school, the Carleton rep gave such a bad presentation, I performed horribly in drama and after school drama, and everyone was being bitchy today except for a few people
But I'm still pretty happy because I'm going to get through it
Yeah that was jake I'm pretty sure
And I'm gonna get everything done
We talked the first week
Why was the Carleton presentation bad?
My back hurts perpetually more or less
What happened in drama and who was bitchy?
The video game format does, I guess. I actually think so, yes
What is due soon?
The thing is that I've never had shitty posture and a bad back until recently
Rep showed up late and we only had around 20 minutes to ask her questions
The Hampshire rep was a mess!!! She moved to Amherst a month ago and knew literally nothing about the school. Grew up in Maine and went to school in Ohio. when someone asked about social sciences she said "yeah social justice is big on campus... Is that what you meant?"
Well in drama I just wasn't on my game. Being off book was so bad for me today even though I knew my lines.
And I didn't feel like singing so I sounded bad
Chinese quiz Thursday, CC survey and spreadsheet due tomorrow 😦, game theory hw Thursday, bio quiz Thursday and paper Friday, drama/AIDA shit, AIDS promoting, eagle project and merit badges
Omg those sound like AWFUL presentation 
That's actually quite a bit of work!
I just need a mattress pad. The bed sucks
Bad posture? You?
I know!!! At least my last day at work is this Saturday and I can focus on all of that and the farm 
I'm off all next week :)
Are those available for purchase? Like can you get one if you want to?
Haha shocking, I know.
Didn't even realize how bad it was until the drama teacher told me and suggested I try stretching again 
Yeah but it's expensive and shit. I might tho. 
Anyway b I am sleeping now so
Goodnight!
AND WORK ON YOUR POSTURE BEFORE YOU END UP A HUNCHBACK LIKE ME
Ok but listen to the song Magnets by Lorde!!!!
Will do!
Hahahahah 👻🎃🔮🍬
You won't even need a Halloween costume
Jk
😷😺👷👄🐮🐙
Goodnight!🍓💦🐒👯
Went to a talk today about the rum production in Rhode Island by a PhD candidate from Georgetown. His college? Carleton.
And he was hella gay
Hey :)
How are you doing?
Reyna and I are at SAAF right now
Hahaha what did he have to say about rum production? Was that historically the main export/import?
Omg I have to tell you about what happened today with northeastern
That man sounds like my dream though
I am great! Though I am a bit stressed for my infectious disease assignment, but I'll finish it tomorrow. I didn't realize that people don't all get good grades on those, and I might as well just be lucky to have done so well so far
It was a big export, and the brown family was involved. They made 100 proof rum and shipped millions of gallons to Africa 
Until the molasses became problematic to get
In the early 19th century
Omg how is SAAF
Tell me later!
What's the assignment? I'm sure you'll do fine!
 
 
Where are these from
It's just another response to papers, I got 100 on the other two, but apparently he's a hardcore grader
It's a Tucsonan LGBT newspaper called The Observer 
The brown family?
Lol so then they opened a university to keep making money or what?
Yeah those who opened brown
You should write for the observer 
No lol it was like philanthropy
One of my initial comments was that I would love to write for them lol
Today billings came up to the MPR and gathered all the xican or Hispanic students to go to the northeastern presentation because of a scholarship for poor, underrepresented first-gen students and was totally being racist because I'm not first gen 
But anyway the rep was a super awesome gay Syrian with an arm tattoo and ear piercings. He lit up when I said I wanted to go abroad in the Middle East for journalism or history 
We stayed late with Michael (this is the 2nd time lol) and he actually got us a bunch of lube and condoms and told us to have fun
The moon right now is so fucking gorgeous 
Gay Arabs <3
(In concept at least)
But you are poor and underrepresented
Lol have fun 
Lol lol
What does it look like? Can't go out now
Multiple people said he reminded them of me when I'm older
When and how did you decide on Emmett as your name?
It's very large and had an orange tint
Bitch I'm already havin fun
The scholarship is for people who fit all the categories and have terrible grades and scores. They fly them to Boston to take IQ tests and see if they can handle college rigor lol
Idk I don't recall anymore. I think Reza and I came up with it
Lol actually it's way later here anyway so I wouldn't see it like you do
How did he phase it? I'm sure he didn't say IQ tests
He said tests to measure their capabilities lol
Well, that sure wasn't the answer I was expecting hahah. I'm never gonna forget my Zayk phase
Wow my muscles have been coming in so nicely
The people in the bio classes are awesome because they make practice quiz documents for everyone to practice
Pic?
Lol my class would never do that
Also I'm very set on piercings
Like michael's Inner ear
Adam lambert gone wild
He actually looks like my grandpa's other grandson
Joking about that photo?
Why would I be joking...
 
That reflection is so nice
Anyway
That's nice! Looks great!!!
🌚🌚🌚 chat more tomorrow
Alrighty
I'm not in school today because I felt too overwhelmed 
Btw those fall trees are pretty! Whatever side of the campus you're on is actually nice
Why are you feeling that way?
Do you wanna chat?
Lol that's the side of campus that was pictured in all the previous photos
Well I'm eating breakfast now and I'm gonna go to school in an hourish
But what other time are you free to talk?
Also I know I already told you but I'm free all next week
Lol seriously? Maybe it was entirely the trees then. I swear the buildings in the recent ones looked nicer.
I mean.., I guesss it's pretty
Oh I thought you weren't going to school in general
I'm pretty busy from here on out until Monday or Tuesday 
Lol it's the same building hahahahaha
My aesthetic preferences change every two weeks
I wasn't gonna go to school but I need to take two quizzes
And I can't miss my two rehearsals 
Two??
that's perfect because I have a lot of working and farm stuff to do over the weekend
Two quizzes? Two rehearsals?
Alright 
Yes, we start blocking for AIDA today and unfortunately I'm in a bunch of scenes soo... And we need to have Harvey shit down by next week
Bio mammals quiz and Chinese quiz today
OMG I forgot to tell you
How have you been today?
I'm working on Urinetown
Oh what lol
Assistant lighting designer
I'm pretty pumped
Really!!!! So you actually got the lighting internship?
Congratulations!!!!!
No it's not an internship lol
😛😛😛
Not everything in the world is an internship gosh!!!
😀😀😀
Well when you first told me about it I think you used that word hahah
It must be hard to be in rehearsals for two shows at once 
I think I'm gonna do lighting for the next drama show we do. I want to do everything from costumes to the acting to the lighting.
When do you start?
Yeah, it's actually very stressful because I don't want to mix up lines or fall back on one play and not the other.
What'd you do today?
Garrett's gonna show you?
I am meeting with the main designer this weekend, but serious work starts in like 2 weeks, and it opens in 5 weeks
Today I went to class and then rested because it was an early class
Now I'm working on reading some papers 
I corrected like 3 weeks of math homework yesterday, did 3 weeks worth on Tuesday, and some phage homework. Now I'm doing Infectious Disease stuff that I've been putting off, but it's due on Monday and I prefer to not stress over the weekend so 
My virus seems happy! I'll try to send some photos tomorrow when I'm at the lab
How are things socially
Yes, right now he's teaching an 8th grader Griffin and he's teaching Casey.
Shit you have barely any time to do it!!! At PCC for the play Reza was in they had to know their lines solid in two weeks.
I read an interesting article about what it meant for politicians to duel in the 1750-1800s
Primarily focusing on Hamilton and Burr, and the morality and mannerisms back then
I'm still reading it though. It's like 14 pages
You seem to be really productive though, I'm so proud of you
Socially is great! I always have people to go to when I'm lonely. Last night Reyna and I had a blast, pretending the paper bags Michael gave us were packed lunches
I don't feel lonely anymore
I love everyone in drama except for Zev because he fucks me up during dances
I went to ask the straight boys, who huddle together in a corner in game theory, if they wanted to participate in the AIDSwalk and they gave me such stupid answers
They acted like it was some huge joke and they were like "ummm... I play video games on Sunday"
GriffGriff!
Awww you know him!!! He's hilarious
Where did you find the article
You chatting with Reza?
Ranya!!!
Btw Joseph wanted me to tell you that nothing he said was meant to be harmful, like about making your face and stuff. The reason I got upset though was it was just insensitive. My analogy was going to an anti-Israeli conference and him saying "you're doing so and so right now and you look Israeli," knowing that the people around would react violently. It was insensitive. But he got upset with me for telling you and wanted me to clear things up.
rosinbum gave us the article yesterday. He gives the most interesting articles about things I otherwise wouldn't be interested in, sometimes science-related
My mom actually chatted with Reza lol when she went to see the play
Reyna said she would love to be my lifelong friend because we can go a long time without seeing each other, and when we finally do it's like no time has passed
She went to see his play??
Yes that's how I feel about you and Reyna
Yeah I chatted with him 
lol reserved for cis vans
Does each house have their own eating area?
Hahah yeah, weird huh? He invited me to go see it but I said my mom and brother would instead
How was your day today?
I got the highest grade in my class on the Chinese quiz and I got a 30/30 on my bio quiz what whaaaaat
No, but both of the main freshman quads have food in or nearby
What show was it again?
My day was great! After all the academic things went wel
My roommate taught me to roll proper joints 
And now I'm going to a rumba event
Like Latin Jazz festival
Fuck youuuu wow you're so lucky. So like a Chico & Rita kinda thing?
Have fun!!! 
congrats on the assessments!!!
It was only ok
Mostly a bit repetitive 
Some was great tho
It's a whole week-long thing
Are you probably not going to go to another show? Did you take any pictures?
I might go... I didn't but others did, I can get a video to you tomorrow! 
Lol I can't believe your roommate taught you that. Was it easier than expected? I remember watching Elliot have to do it at Diviya's house
Remind me please!
The show was a Ramona and Beezus type of show, only with different names
Henry and Ramona?
Hahah ok :) gracias
 Oh ya! Loved those in elementary school
I got some new underwear I must show you tomorrow 
I originally wasn't gonna reply to you because I thought you were asleep lol
Like bc it's almost 1 you know?
Awwwww! I thought you totally forgot about my interests and would never send pics again
Of underwear and peaches and flowers
Yeah I'm about to fall asleep actually
I will! 
You loved rolling papers in elementary school?
Hmm
I want to see eggplant in return of course
Hahshaha
Of course! :)
My roommate is a pro, so it's not like just fucking around and rolling one
He is very serious
He has his own little scale and everything to measure how much in each and a chart for how much to sell it for, huh?
Hahaha noooo that's Aiden the Rhode Islander down the hall
He has his shit together
And he traveled the world like hardcore
Lol and you would think the Rhode Islander would steal measuring cups and liquor bottles
Like he has a map on his wall of where he has gone
And he's only 17/18?
It's like Mongolia and Southeast Asia and South Africa, all of Europe, South America. I think he might have taken a year off, he's 19 I think
I've been considering a gap year but I think it's best to get on with my life
Yeah unless you have a clear plan
I'm kinda on the fence about it. I don't want to jeopardize anything
Ugh!!!
He's white, yes?
Lol yes Aiden O'Ferrell
how is that relevant tho
It just fits the white boy who wants to experience some culture so he takes a gap year stereotype 
Who wants to spice up his life lol
So he dates a Latino boy
Who is actually white at heart
:)
With that, I need to go to sleep
Long day tomorrow!
Ok lol
I hope it's a long one with purpose!
And not tediousness 
Yes!
🌚🍆🐸❤️🆒🐙☀️
🌚🔮🎃👯🐒🍓🌺💖
Goodnight 😘
Goodnight!
Should I expect pictures of campus or 🍑? Lol
Campus 
Unfortunately
And underwear but not my own
At first I was like "not your own...? Ummm"
Did he bring the graduation bong with him lol
Also that classroom looks like it's in a basement or something
I think he did not 
It's on the first floor lol just no windows 
It's actually a chic classroom, my pic did no justice 
He lives an hour away though so he might get it sometime
His parents give no ducks
Fucks
Dad went to brown, did a lot of LSD
class of 1973 (or something like that), baby!
Or maybe it was 1970
Btw I'm not gonna be in school until 10:30ish lol
But I will be working and stuff 
What class was that? And how did you manage to take the picture??? I don't want you to get in trouble. You could've taken it after class.
And they chose to reside in Rhode Island??
Dr. Williams suggested Hendrix college to Bella and said when he was there he and a bunch of friends took a canoe out to the lake and did hallucinogens
It was infectious disease class before class
Lol no Boston
Is that close by
He told her that???
My prof was the silver haired laddy
Did you ever listen to Magnets
Oh, everyone looked super focused so it looked like the middle of class
Omg you wouldn't believe the things he has told her and her Latin class
Some jaguar goddess he saw in South America while hallucinating
These pictograms are fascinating:
(You have to read the small print)
In class now, will message in a few hours (class until 2 your time :O)
Lol starting the anti-administration sentiment early
Ok! Have fun lol
😛😛😛
Couldn't rally message on th way there cos rain
Fuck rain and wind
Yeah I heard the east coast was expecting a huge storm
And there's hurricane Joaquin emergency prep all throughout the east coast
We have a hurricane plan in action 
You'll have to tell me what that consists of when you get back
I'm curious
 Haha
Also that ad looks like a bong lol
Lol that's super intentional
Hey :)
Como eat as
Estes
Sara's
*ESTAS HOLY FUCK
Did you end up sending undies
Actually o know the answer to that lol
The round tailed ground squirrel's Spanish name is juancito!! Isn't that so cute
I will send tonight I think
Omgggg
That's so cute
How was your day
Here's a snake strangling a round-tailed ground squirrel:
Today was pretty cool! In research we did public speaking exercises (I'm awful at impromptu speaking, but we eventually did a prepared one). One of the exercises was two truths and a lie, and I told the class funny stories about church camp
I honestly had such a lazy day today. I got fast food burritos and relaxed when I got home
How are you doing? How was your day??
Did you see the thing where models wore other models at Paris fashion week?
Also never watch porn after posting an Instagram picture unless you want to be distracted by notifications ugh!
Wait that's sad AF
like so sad
What was the lie for you?
Paco's?
My day was alright, got less work done than I would have liked, but all I have for the next week is this ID shit which shouldn't take more than an hour so
That's actually a pretty fresh idea
Hahahahaha ha that's why I turned off my divas notifications 
 I was gonna send the conventional cute squirrel pic but I was feeling a little rebellious
The lie for me was that I performed "you know what to do with that Holy Bible... STUDY STUDY STUDY! *angelic noises*" because the idea got shit down hahah
*shut down
Nope, that kinda shitty xican place by my house haha
What's the ID shit? And what's the emergency hurricane plan?
At least you got so much done already!
The best lies are ones based on fact
ID is just a paper
Hurricane plan I will send!
Like a response to a paper as per usual
This week it is theoretically about endogenous retroviruses, but mostly about HIV 
And this one antiviral protein called TRIM5
Lol is that literally why you turned of notifications?!
Looks like the hurricane's not gonna hit us tho
Yeah
Like actually yeah
Hey so I'm gonna be pretty busy until 8:30 but I'll talk to you after if you're still up :)
Alright
U ok?
Yeah, I'm still working
How're you?
I used that same website for a bio journal, PLoS?
Goodnight :)
Yeah PLoS
It's good
Good night!
Sorry I was not on my phone all night
That's fine hahah
Hi!
I wanted to make sure I texted you today
So it's 11:48 and I'm texting you!!!!
Lol I thought you would be busy today so I didn't want to disturb you 
But thanks :)
Currently:
In my car, park place parking lot
Eating chipotle
Saw woman get pinned to ground by aggressive man, face against ground
And arrested
Oh shit
Who got arrested 
Like right now right no 
Some 40 year old woman. She's crying "don't touch my baby!!!"
At first I thought it was an abusive boyfriend but nope
How was your day today?
What's up
I'm out, going to a crew or football party unsure. I went to the mall today! It was nice as hell
So much better than AZ
how was your day
Ooh what did you get from there?
Another football game haha? Against which college this time?
My day was pretty fun. I was home alone most of the day so I sang my songs, ran through lines, watched a movie. I went to work and bought some clothes. It's my last morning tomorrow!
I have stories to tell you
Right now I'm headed over to the loft
I hope you're having fun :) still awaiting underwear hahahah
have a goodnight
I returned some stuff to AE that I ordered online, and bought some shorts (!!)
Also I started wearing jeans 
1 pair
The football game was University of Rhode Island
We won!
What movie did you watch?
And tell me the stories!
Underwear will come as soon as roommate gets out
Today
Also last night was so good Sergio, I finally had a nice college party night. We drank at the college radio station, then went to the crew (rowing) team's house where there was like a real dance party
Like good music, dark, cool lights lots of people actually dancing and giving no fucks
the lady got stabbed last night while her husband was murdered. In her testimony she said that she ran through the street with the knife in her shoulder screaming for help and that the Palestinian shop keepers clap their hands and wish for her to die.
Abbas the "moderate" this week
There's a guy on my floor who is apparently of the third richest family in New Zealand. He's cool but low-key judgey about everything 
Lots of kids here like that
All the international kids almost goddamn
They are wealthy AF
some aren't most are
Kids of CEOs, things like that
A famous rapper from South America 
I think Sophia uses male pronouns because someone referred to him/them as her "boyfriend" 
My coworker came in to work from a party last night and she doesnt remember anything, only that she got into a car accident
Ummm you have to take a picture of yourself in those. I'm serious... Because I actually can't believe that
You in jeans is like me in basketball shorts and a tank top 
That's a normal female assigned at birth gender queer thing 
Wtf
She was driving drunk?
They are in the wash but I will eventually
Also I'm not ignoring you but I'm kinda busy so I'll text you when I can
:)
Hey
How it do
How were you able to drink at the college radio station hahahah?
Is there any sort of application discrimination against international students?
Like why is it usually the wealthier ones who end up in the college
I watched a horror movie, Goodnight Mommy
Lol they had a party there
Like they bought all the booze and cups and everything 
And two of my friends here work there so they were invited and brought us
Also there was the super serious student BASIS Scottsdale girl 
I think they may get less financial aid, like not 100% need met but I'm not sure
But also because the kids who can get their applications to fit foreign standards often go to (private) international schools or private schools geared towards American colleges 
I do know one poor South African girl tho
Sorry I'm not really busy or anything but my head hurts so ya 
I tried napping and then started to watch a movie, and I ended up eating lol
The super serious BASIS girl went to the party?
Yeah, I was thinking that it had to do with their focus on those schools and that they were in programs geared towards American admissions 
When I was working yesterday and elderly lady came in and was being super bitchy to me, and luckily she forgot soon after that, because she started asking me personal questions. Then she said, "hmm... AIDSwalk and theatre... Are you gay???"
Obviously I hesitated because I didn't want to start anything and have her scream at me
after I said yes she was like "good for you. Good for you for being out like you are. I grew up in rural Indiana and gay people would have been killed. You have so many opportunities and you're so lucky. Go get educated and be gay."
Then she was telling me to be careful because these days on grindr I'll never know who I'm meeting with and the guy may want to hurt me
Also something that happens frequently at savers is that customers ask for our numbers, and yesterday some frat boy asked my friend for her number and she was super excited about that
During my free period I was outside practicing lines, and zellmer came out and was like "oh, señor, I was just coming to check on you. What are your plans for fall break? I'm going to Minnesota to check out Minneapolis as a place to live"  
And when I told him two of my top college choices were there he immediately was like, "we should meet up and have lunch sometime if you end up there"
Pretty cool dude
Sorry, it's just that earlier I wasn't in the story telling mood and I was so busy driving around and stuff
Hope you're doing well
I was kinda pissed off because Richie was home and I wish I had stayed out all day instead of coming home
He had my mom buy him a shirt with weed leaves from Spencer's, and then he "realized" today and had to go return it
Also Alex came home saying that his dad's girlfriend abused him so now the police are on their way
Yeah, it's not that I thought she didn't party it was just a juxtaposition. 
How did AIDSwalk come up??
It would be so weird/cool if you both ended up in MN
How often do the police come?
He would tell me about all the tail he's getting and I would tell him about my studies
He was like "you're gonna need lots of layers for the Minnesota winters!" And Zayna interrupted with, "that's not our forte" and he looked at me and raised an eyebrow 
Lol when I tell people what I've done they're like "but you go to basis!!! You're not SUPPOSED to have a life"
She was asking what I'm looking forward to this month
Police come at least once a month 
What's up with you?
Lol or possibly the reverse 
I'm just studying, and napping 
What have you done at basis you tell them?
I am so happy to be working on two shows
One of the shows will only have lighting set up time from 11PM-2AM every night for a week......
I tell them about our parties and that I'm not a virgin and they're shocked
Urinetown and what else?
To customers???
Lol I have friends outside of savers omg
I have realized that our parties habits are not normal for high schoolers 
11 apocalypses 
Anyway, I don't work there anymore
Uhhhh are you ready for that commitment?
Yeah, I realized that a long time ago. What's sad is that Jay says going to something without alcohol isn't fun.
The frequent drinking is what isn't normal, not really the parties themselves 
What's 11 apocalypses?
Why wouldn't I be?
Idk lol I haven't gone to any meetings yet
:( Jay's habits are so unhealthy
And it upsets me how his extremeness normalizes our behavior 
It's not only his drug use and stuff, but he refuses to stop being sad over Elizabeth and talks to her all day, including during class
He cried when we were trying to take the phone away from him
And drinking is certainly not the right way to deal with loneliness 
It took less time than expected for me to get over you
And I'm usually the one with the strong emotions and capricious tendencies
People now think of our grade as heavy cocaine users when it's literally just jay
Anyway
Do you have a pic of me with the blonde highlight?
Idk I wasn't sure if that was something you would be willing to do. Seems like something I wouldn't do
Why??
Does he drink during the day?
Yes but I feel as though you are more intense but for shorter periods
I just want to show them
Is it for a boy 
Because the only picture I have is of us and I don't think that's something you'd want to show lol
Sorry I didn't forget about the Latin Jazz music videos but things are a bit weird between me and the girl who filmed it 
Lol no it's for Bethany
Ok then:
The two shows are at different times
One is in November, the other a month later
She has heard a lot about you haha
Good or the bad?
What kinds of things do you say
I remember a conversation we had
I was tutoring at Chai's house and I was in the basement in the bathroom
And I texted you "what will we say to our next boyfriends about each other?" And we talked about that
He does not drink the day, but it wouldn't surprise me if he started to
Good of course!
Why are things weird with the girl?
Just like about you and your family and journey and our friendship history
I recall vaguely that it was important to us to emphasize and talk about all the positive aspects
You tell her how im gonna pound the shit outta ya the moment u get back here boi 
Jk lol
Or am I....? 😦
She thinks I like her and am secretly straight because I was drunk and lacked coordination and touched her boob
But just a graze not a grab
Yaaaaas
We are going to do that, of course
?
Absolutely
Hahah oh boy
Our friendship history
I was thinking about that this week
It's just absolutely fucking insane how I went from completely hating you to loving you more than anyone in the whole entire universe
Like we were mortal enemies 
On the brink of being eternal ones if it hadn't been for Reza 
Reza brought us together??
Yes, the positive aspects.
He's the one who told me you hated my pants so I confronted you about it
Right hahahahahahahaha
Half checkered half black
Lol wow if that bitch who thinks you like her saw me at the parties with all the girls she would think we were in some polygamous relationship 
I feel terrible for making out with Madeleine 
It's something I refuse to acknowledge happened
My "journey" lol
Now that I don't have you to talk to all the time I fear that I've lost IQ points 
You did what? I
Hahahahaha
I thought I lost IQ points
But I'm actually doing fantastic in my hard class
Like definitely the top student and the only first-year
But it's mostly because I'm super familiar with the subject 
It will recover I assure you
Do you feel like there's an ego problem with brown students that kinda conflicts with work ethic and desire to learn?
It's weird to me that this year (and every year) I'm experiencing things you've gone through 
Not at all, they mostly just have inferiority complexes 
Eh, in college it isn't linear you know
Like I'm not being challenged for shit
Same...
This year is such a joke. A majority of my stress derives from my extracurriculars
I can't believe how quickly you have gone from being behind to not being challenged 
My only "tough" class is game theory, until I start the homework an hour before it's due an get an A or B+
Like I procrastinate hardcore because it's bullshit
lol no, you can't say "same..."
I am done with all of my homework until next Monday!! 
I submit everything ASAP mostly
No I can because
Does that mean you'll have movie time :D
Or we can talk time haha
Also I've stopped giving a fuck about having people edit my essays
In fact, I've decided to do it all independently 
I no longer send them to anyone and I work on them and edit them as I like
My lab class is just lab, it's nothing hard. My infectious disease class isn't material I know strictly speaking but it isn't hard, and there is nearly no reading. My math class I took in 10th grade, and my computer class is a joke more or less
It makes everything easier
Yes we can do that!
Lol I never even re-read my essays for grammar etc. 
You were going to tell me about computer science haha. I wrote down things you told me you would tell me about.
(I'm not obsessive, I swear)
It's just a bad habit
What's funny is how you can take these kinda difficult classes, end up with a degree in biology, and make 60k
I've also started reading Catcher in the Rye
Tell me other things I said I would tell you about?
Like this week the assignment was to create an excel spreadsheet.... With charts and shit
Burqas and the Spaniard guy
Western vs. European ideals
But later we will be doing HTML and Python. Still it won't be hard
Hahahahaha
Oh god, I found the poems I told you I would send every day but then stopped because I was too embarrassed 
Yes we later had another heated discussion in which he insisted that the North Koreans accept their oppression and we should basically not try to help them
No do it hahaha
lol... Create an excel spreadsheet... And you get a grade for that?
I mean like its a bit more than that
Some data analysis 
Still can't get over your politics class/teacher haha
But nothing serious, it took like no time
How fucked up is that???
Lol I talked to a sophomore who had her as an advisor and she was like "I have no idea why they keep her"
I want to hear his bases
This is fucked up but my theory is that
Does it involve affairs?
They are pushing hard for minority professors (this is factual) and she is black and they don't want to let go of minority professors without serious serious grievance s
His bases?
Oh yeah, definitely
I think that applies to elderly and minority teachers
Elderly?
Do you listen to Dolly Parton?
It's a stereotype for administration to feel bad about letting go of elderly teachers 
Oh, but that's usually if they have long been there
The Spaniard guy's reasoning for the North Korea thing
She is new, relatively 
Oh ok that's what I assumed you meant
Lol I once suggested a Dolly Parton song to you
His argument was 
Oh ya
Like one of my favorite songs
They aren't rebelling, and thus they don't mind it
Por que!
And that it doesn't matter if they are brainwashed 
Or repressed
I was just listening to her
There's not enough traction for rebellions like in the Middle East?
The concept of democracy isn't as ubiquitous 
Or understood
Did he take into consideration the power of censorship?
Not quite. Rather that we are justified in middle eastern nation-building because the people want it, but that the people there clearly support their government no matter the mass deaths and poverty that are present and thus all is good. And I said the same was true in Nazi Germany
There's a different mindset there when the people feel powerless and that there are superiors
It was not a nuanced argument from him
He discarded it and said if they truly cared it would change. Thy censorship is irrelevant 
Lol sounds like a Jay to me
Which folly Parton sting
*dolly Parton song did you hear
That's such a stupid argument oh my god
I will always love you and of course Jolene 
Those are the two songs I suggested to you lol
Long ago
of course I have to listen to them now
Even though she can't carry the notes the way Whitney can, her voice against the music is so nice
I think that country music expresses emotion really well
Like no matter what they're saying, it's better than some music with deep lyrics 
They make road head sound like a candlelit dinner with intense eye contact 
They - country singers
Not that it doesn't feel like that already ;P
We have chocolate chip cookie slices and brownie slices which are slices on the smaller end of normal pizza slice size 
Like they make massive circular brownies and cookies
It's awful
It's like they intentionally cater to stoners 
Oh I thought you were gonna say that they were trying to keep the freshman 15 alive hahah
Picture!
Sergio has never seen a cookie so big
Sorry I was chatting with rookie
Roomie
A his friend from home lives on our floor too and wrote a book upon which a new HBO show is based
The Leftovera
I like her voice a lot though
Leftovers
I looked the book up and the author is a 54 year old man lol?
Hahahahaha country. 
I will take one!
Sorry his friend's dad
I was too focused on grammar to have correct content in that sentence 
His son's name is Luke Perotta
Maybe I should read that book
I heard the book was a bit slow but good
I'm so excited to be reading again
What are you reading?
Catcher in the Rye while simultaneously reading a book on logic rosinbum gave me
Oh right sorry you just said that
How is that
After that I'm going to hit those Dahl books you gave me hahah
It's interesting because the narrator speaks very informally, but his ideas are universal
Kinda reminds me of myself
Like he's pretty intelligent
He lacked the drive
Did you actually read that book?
Lol no
I mean 
I began to
I enjoyed the concept
But the range of genres that can capture my interest through completion is narrow
I thought, from what I had read, that you would enjoy though
(Anything written by a scholar, lol)
Catcher in the Rye is probably the most stereotypical coming of age novel lol
Like 
Child: oh I'm feeling things
Dad: read this 
I really only do biographies, dystopian novels, and books of opulence (Dorian Gray, Gatsby)
Hahahaha
Anyway I'm gonna crash
Have you read slaughterhouse five? I loved that!!!
But I am happy to chat with you, and glad to have time this week
😘
Hmmm I have a copy at home I will have to peruse when I return 
🌚😘🐢
Very dystopian
Okay haha :)
🌚😻🌺🐒
 
What's the Madeleine story
Have you seen American Pie lol?
I was gonna get two wisdom teeth out this morning without anesthesia, but I hesitated and now I'm getting all 4 out with anesthesia next summer
Seriously dodged a huge bullet
:O
What changed
Yes I have!
The Madeleine story happened at your house lol
I'm getting mine out over winter break
This isn't a recent thing
Yeah I just don't remember it well
Remember the story?
Well they were like "so we can get them out right now" and I started panicking and getting all scared
And I said I didn't feel comfortable without going under
What have you done today?
American Pie is so incredibly sexist lol...
Today I went to two classes, killed it in ID and figured out my calc prof is trans (I knew it!), went to an advising meeting which went well, then resolved an ID card issue. Now I have lecture in 30 min for 2.5 hours 
It's super sexist lol that's the point 
What have you done today?
Yeah remember the story 
I also have no homework, but I need to work on reading Urinetown tonight 
How'd you find out about the calc professor??? 
OOOH what lecture are you going to today?
Take some notes etc.
I have a model UN meeting at 9
See, I thought the movie was just something to appeal to the straight boys and justify behavior 
It's not really pointing out anything and criticizing it
Also might go to a free documentary screening about the Miami gay community at 7
Oh it's just for my phage class
Just like normal. We have 2.5 hour lectures from hell each Monday
That actually does sound awful. I have a friend at Pima who has 3 hour math classes
But it does represent common societal occurrences. It isn't a social commentary, but why is that necessary 
Lol well I suspected about the prof
I had ESPN about it (mean girls reference)
Why aren't you in class
And I looked her up on FB and she posted about trans rights a ton
Today I went to my dentist appointment, went grocery shopping, played with Alex, read and worked on essays, read my book, and now I'm watching American Pie. Super super busy week though so I'm relaxing while I can :(
Fall break!!
Lol you're the one telling ME about an Girls references?
Bitch I invented them
The moment I saw ESPN I knew you weren't talking about sports 
I'm curious to see how the gay community in Miami is represented 
Her voice is super perfect though, she doesn't look masculine AT ALL. The only weird things to me were her bizarre fashion sense, narrow hips, wide shoulders, slightly unkempt hair, and that she is a female math grad student. No one else knows at all tho
the reason I was so excited to watch a movie w u is because I have no hw
Omg fall break
Oh I also picked up a prescription (other side of campus like 0.7 miles away fuck)
What does her being a math grad student have to do with being trans?
Although
It's a stereotype
A lot of the Mills girls are economics or math majors
Math, computer science, and sometimes physics are super trans woman subjects 
Lol I could run that in 6 minutes
Maybe 5
Lol it's 55-60 today and everyone is all bundled up and I'm in a rolled up sleeve button down like "bitch I'm from Arizona, we tolerate the weather unlike you bitches"
I looked up the admissions rep who called me from Carleton and she's a black Smith graduate
One guy here can run a sub-5 minute miles
Volleyball team captain at smith 
Mile
So many people here are runners
But I mean she sounded super white...
It's so cool regarding Carleton
And like 30 years old. She's probably like 25
I think they are looking for kids like you, all liberal arts colleges these days are
I mean you're right about mills but given the other factors it was a consideration 
Lol exactly. I rarely ever put on layers. We take it like real southerners!!!!!
Ok I'm joking btw
I would never say that
Which part
Like I'm not even cold out there
I want to be a runner or do some sport for fun! PE is a Carleton requirement, and that could be yoga class or broomball or ice skating
"kids like you"
What does that mean?
What am I
Turn around minorities to be blunt 
The real southerners part lol
#opencurriculum4lyfe
Well I don't have to declare a major just yet so I can explore classes. Only 1/3 of my classes are major related
And how many for distribs
Distribs
Distribution requirements
Or other requirements 
Well it's 1/3 elective, 1/3 major, and 1/3 seminar or some fancy Carleton acronym for their academic program
I had some story to tell you but it slipped my mind!!!! Fuckkk
I was telling my mom how upset I was over the refugee crisis 
And she was like "well there's nothing we can do about it. You should start locally if you want to make a difference and change the world. Look at this website"
And she pulls open this website where I can send a letter of encouragement to a xican child 
Lol
Hahahahahahahahahahha
Not what I was looking for, and I probably won't take it
Oh that's so your mom
I just found out about a class called the biology of AIDS, I think it's next semester and it's so exciting!
She had a xican child pen pal before I was born, apparently
Damn you!!!! 
Things like that interest me and I'm not even that fascinated by science 
My time is near
?
I will be blessed with opportunities soon 
Yes!
To take the classes I want to take
I love my biology classss
Classes
I have an interview with the Carleton rep on my second day so I hope I kill that
Also I really hope I like the school
Brown is the best and I love it
I would hate to have these high expectations and then be disappointed 
I hope you do too!!!
Brown seems like a great school, actually 
I'm glad you're having fun
It's fucked up to me though
That like we get so much privilege over the greater providence community
One of the reasons why I've stopped missing you so much is because I know you're enjoying your time
Police don't come on campus, just campus police, who won't arrest students ever. 
No matter what drugs or anything else you do nothing will happen
What I think is so fucked up is that I'm deemed unworthy of matriculation to those institution and connections because of my past
It might as well be Amsterdam 
*imstitutions
Hahahahahahahaha
Imstitutions
Ugh lol
I'm glad you fee that way
You know what I'm saying
And yes it is fucked up, but you can transfer if you want to!
And also you can find these opportunities in upper division classes everywhere 
Lol "hey Aimee... Er... Emmett! I'm a Brownie"
Brown is just blessed to have them for us first years 
What
"Peek-a-boo! Guess who's on your dorm floor this year!!"
Oh Hahahahaha
Brunonian bitch
That sounds hideous!
I would be so happy if you did end up here because I know you would love it
I feel like I would too actually
Yesterday I was considering visiting campus just to visit
Sometime in the near future
You would be welcome to my room
As a part of my college research process I look at all of their Instagram and Facebook stuff
And brown's are just so fucking cool
They have a Humans of Brown thing and I was laughing on my bed reading them
What are they like?
They seem like such average people
And they are
Lol this week there is a popular seminar (hundreds going) on cissexism
Which is why I'm so upset with myself and the systems in place that lock me out
Our daily blog is basically. Brown-themed buzzfeed
This all makes me resentful yet hopeful
As much as I hate it I crave it
Lol I feel like minorities just hate everyone who isn't a minority 
That is fostered by tumblr
Cis sexism is such a sad concept
^^ yes
Can you send a link to the daily blog???
Would you be okay with me transferring to brown lol
I would!
Sorry I was in class 
Haha that's okay! I'm making some vegetable fettuccine Alfredo with spinach and tomato
How was it?
It's soooo good
Also the how was it was for you, not referring to my food lol
Ok regarding gun laws; I know that I was all for freedom and 2nd right amendment and whatnot, but don't you feel that heavy regulation with freedom on hunting grounds (with the power to divvy up hunting weapons to people with background checks) could solve a lot of problems?
I just really feel there is no way for sure to know who you're selling a gun to
And a matter of mental illness isn't enough of an excuse
It was ridiculous
He condensed 2.5 hours of material into an hour
Ok but how can that coexist
Like take their guns when they leave the hunting groundV
?
And what about protection of the family, the main thing people say they need guns for
I just think mass shooting is unavoidable given the circumstances and not a real issue. It's not at all common, but the media makes it seem like it is
Have you had any quizzes or exams yet??
No, my idea is that the hunting grounds would have guns that people check out for the day and return later. Without a circulation of guns, the only thing American families would have to worry about is knives and potential firearm contraband.
Why are robbers afraid to invade homes during the day or when people are home?
Awww omg American Pie taught me that girls are complex and not just something I put my dick in
Lol no none
But criminals will retain guns...
Lol is that sarcasm regarding American pie?
When the criminals are arrested their guns are possessed and melted down so we can improve infrastructure 
No... I learned what it is to be a man after that movie..
How to love like a man
And how to fuck like a man
What's up with you?
You gonna go see that gays in Miamiovjoe?
*'iami movie
*miami
I mean yes but that's never perfect at all, and not particularly realistic in the political climate. Not even dems would touch that
Hahahahaha
Lol I was curious and went to the cissexism thing and I wanted to slap the whole world
Well then I guess I'm gonna have to be a MAN about this and steal dem motherfuckers guns myself, eh?
I guess I'm gonna have to be touchin it. Getting my hands dirty for 'merican safety!!!!
Omg you need to tell me about that
I would probably stand up and start flashing my cis privilege all over the place, but then I'd be excused cuz like I'm gay and xican and poor 
What even is an argument for cissexism??? Like I rationally cannot think of something 
Maybe that's my privilege speaking though
What do you mean an argument for it
Lol it wasn't like that but it was ridiculous. Such hypocrites 
Like here there are so many things said for the sake of political correctness but never implemented  
Well like that cis people do something worthy of condemnation 
Did they acknowledge that it's not conducive to anything 
No no
That wasn't it at all
Like that wasn't the point at all
They basically meant transphobia or how things are unintentionally inconvenient for trans people. But it's called the "ism" series so they called it cissexism instead of transphobia
What did you think of the seminar itself as a trans person
Did you agree with anything
Also can I just say
I know understand why you thought Oscar was ugly
In a very very nice way
I didn't really agree with like any of it
It was all so out of proportion
One alright bit was called a day in the life
They spoke about how some everyday scenarios might play out for a trans person
Or the interview with Janet mock asking the cis lady invasive questions 
What do you mean
Did they focus on both sexes for this?
And then we get to the other thing that low key pissed me off
It was 100% trans women
100%
explain the cis lady invasive questions thing?
And 80% of those were black, 10% Latina
Yeah, I kinda figured that would be the case
I feel like there isn't enough FTM representation
There are WAY more ftms at brown than MTF
Lol I'm laughing so hard
Although I'm really sorry, because I usually ask you those questions but it's not because I think that's all you are
I just value our communication and feel that we are comfortable enough with each other to where we don't need to restrict ourselves when it comes to it
So I hope I haven't bothered you with that
Well the really "hot" thing right now is MTF, so I don't think they're taking the population into consideration 
Lol even though she's a relative moderate she's more easily offended by far than I am
It's because MTFs are "more oppressed"
Well I mean how much more likely is it for an MTF woman to be attacked or harassed or raped than an FTM man
But I understand where you're coming from, too
 Something super weird is happening w my phone be I just updated
Anyway yeah I take back anything I said about Oscar being attractive
Have you told your roommate about yourself?
Lol no and I don't plan to
Pretty sure he figures I'm gay though
Ok sure but some basic lip service
Would be appreciated 
He's weirdly Chubb
Chubby
Oh!!! You watch lip service too!!
Ah see I thought you two would've had a push-up contest and then you took of your shirt, forgetting about your scars, and he found out
Or like he walked in on you changing shirts 
He wouldn't kn
Know what it means
Like he really truly would not know. I've found that people really never ever assume trans
In any context
Ever
Scream queens?
I mean the only reason I do now is because I know the signs 
Wait
Have you seen scream queens?
No but I want to
I saw the first episode and it sucked lol
Really?
Like it's actually sooooo bad
They try to be scary but it's lame ass sorority bitch tricks
Ryan Murphy keeps disappointing these days :/
AHS?
The latest two seasons sucked... I hope hotel makes up for something
Kinda only watching it for gaga and the tradition of watching it at this point
It's awesome because the loft shows AHS trailers on the big screen 
Really what is lip service though
It means they should give the effort to mention, that that in itself is a service 
:(
It's not his chubbiness, but like I got a real look at his face and I thought I was staring back at Marc Anthony
That's so sad regarding AHS
It was freaky as fuckkk
Well it's nothing I'm not used to already after glee lol
Idk why my phone keeps sending things as text messages
Are you getting my messages twice?
Is anything odd on your end
Pero mas gordo :(
Do you still get my Instagram tags?
Ok I hope it works now
Lol
Ya I do!
Ya you do what?
I check dem on the reg
Check what on the ref
Sorry lol I just had to delete the most recent texts for my phone to work
I'm not being stupid
Insta
Lol
It's ok
Hahahah that's fine 😛
What are you still doing up, mister?
I'm reading a musical for a meeting tomorrow
I want to sleep but I must finish. I procrastinated a bit and did real work instead of this
I'm like 3/4 through though
What a coincidence
I'm also doing play/musical work
I have rehearsal tomorrow morning
I have rehearsal Tuesday-Friday :(
Shit
Morning?!?
Are you still behind
Yeah from 10am-2/3:30pm
I'm not behind at all but I feel insecure without my script 
not very confident for Harvey lines and not confident for AIDA harmonies
Blocking and choreography are pretty on point though
And my solo songs
Anyway keep reading!!!! Sorry hahaha
Oh right it's fall break
We have fall weekend, which is just Columbus Day + politically correct smugness 
It will all be fine, don't worry too much!
It's funny how many Latin American and South American countries celebrate Columbus Day while we just despise it
Like oh god you should've heard some people complain about Columbus last year
I was part of that group though
Lol #CollegeBreaks
Just finished 
Yeah... Well they don't like natives either 
To be fair we don't get a day off for it in AZ
It's so creepy bc I hadn't touched my phone for 20 min and just now checked bc I hate the song playing lol
I guess that's true. They celebrate it for different reasons though, like being blessed with what Columbus brought
No I know, but it's sad how in college you rarely get breaks
I mean I get a whole month off for winter 
And two breaks during the semester
So it's not so bad
Can you believe trump university is a thing
What
It is?
It offers real estate, asset management, and entrepreneurship classes
Oh
So it's a money grab scheme
Charges $1,500 to $35,000 for courses
And it doesn't even count for college credit or a degree
B I've gotta go to sleep :(
Haha that's ok :)
When for the movie? I was thinking during the day on Thursday
❤️❤️❤️
I have 5.5 hour gap midday
Lol of course it doesn't
🌚🐢🆒🐸😷
Thursday I'm free after 2pm the rest of the day!
So that would be awesome
Oh....
Agh 
Yeah that won't really work for me
I'm free from 7:30 your time to 1 your time
How about 7:30-9:30
Though I might not have stuff after 2, I will check
Alright! Well we'll talk about it then hahah
I will basically be free after 2 actually so it's ok
Great
Ok!!!
🌚🌺🐝🔮🎃🙇🏽👬
Hey
What's up with you
You caught me as I am falling anap
Awwwwww
Hahah don't worry about it  🙇🏽 go sleep
Talk to ya later gator 
On the radio: it's that season for pumpkin spice everything, but you know what to do with that pumpkin spice beer? Throw it in the trash and drink some real beer!!
On the radio: it's that season for pumpkin spice everything, but you know what to do with that pumpkin spice beer? Throw it in the trash and drink some real 
beer!!
Lol so edgy so manly
Lol the same radio bitch: I know the best way to start a rumor. Go up to anyone and say "this is a secret, don't tell anyone"
I'm already home haha
Gonna go to 4th ave pretty soon
I meant in using phone while driving 
Ah yes, it's a terrible habit..
Have fun in class hahahah
Missing ya today bubby 
Same here :( I'm still so sick
I am coughing so much I have to hold back the nausea 
Fuck!!!! I'm actually really concerned about that... Have you checked out the wellness center or anything?
Bb :(
That's awful
I thought it was going away, so no
I think in Arizona I was insulated from all the coastal cold variants
I got super sick in DC kinda like that. Felt nauseous some days.
I was sick to begin with, but it was probably worsened by that
Are you still gonna go to class?
Yeah of course, I cannot miss class
:(
Hahah the only time when small class size doesn't have its perks
How terrible
Duck of encouragement!!
Awwwwww thanks
Ok b I have class now for an hour will chat later
🐣🐣🐣
Ok :) feel better
Restrain yourself
From barfing alll over the table
Guess who made that art! Luka's mom
Ya I saw!
Oh lol I forgot what I sent in the snap
I had some really good German dumplings with sauerkraut and Havarti cheese
It was like German Mac and cheese
And Bella and I worked on our college essays, which basically means talk the whole time and get some editing in lol
How are you!!
Was class ok today? Even with all your coughing?
Lol
 I hate the picture but for some reason felt like screening it
That sounds amazing where did you have that food
You look like you are Joaquin Phoenix in Her and are "interested" in your phone
It was ok... Coughing became distracting AF
It was an alright day though
Took a quiz, it went fine. Still haven't lost a point in college 
Cafe passé! Also had shitty raspberry Italian soda with cream :( 
Funny thing is that the photo wasn't posed lol
What was the quiz on??
Product rule lol
I didn't know Italian soda could be fucked up
Lol wow no wonder why
I got 100% on almost every single math quiz
I'm at the farm now but I'll text you when I'm done! :)
Ok actually it was cancelled bc of heavy rain lol
Hahaha, but on the infectious disease shit too
Damn
