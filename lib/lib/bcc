 The Quantized World: An Introduction to the Amazing and yet Bizarre Theory of Quantum Mechanics

Mathematically, the theory is well understood. The question of what kind of a world it describes, however, is controversial; there is little agreement, among physicists and among philosophers, about what the world is like according to quantum mechanics. Great Physicists like Albert Einstein who himself worked on quantization of light into particles known as ‘photons” was a great opposer to the new theory,“God does not play dice Albert Einstein.

This is a pressing question. There are more than two million people in prison in the United States today and another five million on probation or parole. Whether those numbers are too high or too low depends a great backed punishment, and there's a great deal of disagreement over what that justification should be. To give a few examples, some people argue that punishment is justified to the extent the offender is morally blameworthy, others to the extent that it prevents crime in the future, others to the extent that it reforms the offender, and still others to the extent that it benefits his victims.

 Literature and Judgment

Investigates the intersections between acts of literature and acts of judgment, between language and the law. How is literature to be judged, when is it "good" or "bad"? Does literature lie, and if so, does it matter? Does it hide a crime? And, in turn: does literature provide its own particular kind of judgment, one that may make evident the very fictional status of the law? Readings span from the Bible to contemporary colonial readings

What was, has been, and is America to Germans? Some believe America to be moving in the right direction, and others imagine America as thoroughly evil from the very beginning. Literature, however, does not say this images. By examining some canonical texts on this topic, the seminar reconstructs the major perceptions, attributions and ascriptions with which German authors over times have envisioned the United States – even without travelling there.

And aesthetic theory has taken various stances towards the depiction 18th century until today.

 Life and Money

Money is not just an economic, but a deeply philosophical issue. It figures in theories of interaction based on exchange and contracts. Money is said to be an "abstract" form of happiness, thus it permeates the being, welfare, and wealth. By opening up a vast horizon of possibilities, money also sharpens our sense of temporality. Issues of social cooperation and cohesion come into play, questions of personal plans are to be raised. In the aftermath of the latest economic crisis it is recommendable to reappraise philosophical texts scrutinizing the role of money in our lives.

 Introduction to the Meaning and Structure of Physics

ranging introduction to physics for nonscientists that emphasizes the fundamental principles and ideas underlying the field of physics. Focuses on three "great" ideas: Newton's laws of mechanics and universal gravitation, Einstein's theory of relativity, and the development of quantum mechanics. Lecture demonstrations and nonconventional laboratory sections illustrate the concepts discussed in class. Knowledge of high school algebra is sufficient background. Not designed to satisfy medical school admission requirements. 

 From Quanta to Quarks, for the Nonscientist

mathematical presentation of the revolutionary discoveries of fundamental Physics of the Twentieth Century. The Lectures begin with Einstein's Relativity and Planck's Quantum Hypothesis, descend into the realms of Atoms and Nuclei, and end with the current limits of our knowledge, the Quark Model of the elementary particles.
