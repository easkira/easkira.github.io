 Conversation with    M Hi How bitchy would it be to reply pretending to be my mom hahahah. I know what you just did with my son, please don't ever text this number again. Lol don't do that Are you going to watch project x without me?? Niet Then what are you going to watch? I also want to watch a movie when I finish my homework. Or I could exercise. Maybe one day we can have the same movie and watch it at the same time and Skype while we watch I'm going to watch the normal heart Maybe shortbus Do all of that! That would be so cute! We definitely need to do that over winter break. What's the normal heart? I think I will ) Or sooner lol? It is a movie based on a play by Larry Kramer. He is basically you but  years older 
He wrote a book called faggots in , pissed a lot of people off. The famous quote is And every faggot couple I know is deep into friendship and deep into fucking with everyone else but each other and any minute any bump appears in their commitment to infinitesimally obstruct their view, out they zip like petulant kids to suck someone else’s lollipop instead of trying to work things out, instead of trying not to hide, and…unh…why do faggots have to fuck so fucking much?! Mostly the last line Holy shit, somebody muttered in the dark. A virgin, sputtered another. I didn't know they still made them. Of the ,, faggots in the New York city area, think primarily with their cocks. You didn't know that the cock was a thinking organ? Well, by this time, you should know that it is. Brilliant guy. Very angry all the time Actually, I'm so glad you mentioned him because he is exactly the type of person I need to reference in my language research paper thank you so much!!! Angry with the lgbt community's obsession with sex and lack of real relationships? Also what do you mean exactly like me lol? What is the topic?  
Yes but a lot more than that. It was a time when people didn't come out, and he was one of the very everyone needs to come out, now! people. Also one of the first responders to HIV. He was behind all of the major activist groups. Here is a very influential article he wrote  Idk he just reminds of you sometimes The transforming public opinion towards the LGBT community from -now with an emphasis on left organizations/groups. You know what my grandpa and mom say? AIDS is on the earth as a punishment for the gays. Sergio I'm a gold mine I know everything About that topic Literally The one real book I have read in  years is on that What is the book? Maybe you can read over my essay sometime, or perhaps even help me adjust my outline so I include more important ideas and exclude unnecessary ones. And the Band Played on. Also the film How to Survive a Plague (on Netflix) Send it  When you finish Well finished my outline last night but I don't know when we are starting the actual writing. She will probably hand back outlines tomorrow since she's a fast grader. I thought you never finished that book lol? No I didn't but I got  pages in sooo I got a lot of it Oh ok! Do you find gay rights history more important than other historical affairs because it somewhat pertains to you? No I just find it interesting. I don't think it's very important. But also since I'm so interested in HIV, I got a lot of gay history as a side salad when researching  Not for a paper just for myself Today Annika said I was looking especially hot. It was funny Fuck you ? That bath picture was wow I can't believe I missed out on that It was a really nice picture Would feel weird to screenshot it You could have screenshotted I would not mind! Are you so interested in HIV bc you want to be a doctor? Yeah, Annika was right hahah ;) I am so horny Sergio  Is it weird to ask for another I want to be a doctor because I am interested in HIV In a bit ;) It was great in the car, I didn't understand why you ask if I'm just saying that *asked Well, you said last time that I had gotten a lot better, but you never complained before ya know But oh I wanted to fuck you so badly  I thought it was especially nice because I was telling you what to do and incorporating your head more this time than before Do you ever masturbate in the bath or shower I'm glad you told me what to do, you should be more forceful with it!! Mm literally once or twice You know what, you're right. Like when I did that to you and you were guiding me on where to go and what was the 'spot' it was super helpful and made me feel better about myself. Lol once or twice per bath? No, once or twice ever I almost never do it in there I want to fuck you right now god why did I say no fuckkkkkkkkkkkkakakakajagsiqos I don't know ( Even though you thought it was gross, it's not like my head was going anywhere. Just the other head with no perception haha. Weird, that's almost always where I do it. You know What does it feel like to you when it first goes in I feel like it is such a special moment Yes! I agree. that's why I always try to kiss you or have our lips together when I first go in.  Also it's relieving and makes me feel victorious ) I am so lucky to be with you Eh, I started watching this documentary called Cropsey about child abductions in Staten Island but I can't handle it. Why did you pick that?? That is so specific Hahah saw this post about the best  documentaries on Netflix this year so I made it a goal to watch them all  Link So there's this one And this  And finally, this How to survive a plague / Bitch Those were all  Also Jesus camp is great Oops, I meant  lol. Actually  so yay. I'm watching Trainspotting and what the fuckkkkk   The whole toilet scenario The first time I tried to watch it I lost it there and quit Only to try again Was debating whether or not to do the same Felt like throwing up / It is a pretty nasty movie. Also hard to understand the slang You know, a lot of drug scenes in movies where people are snorting or injecting things disturb me on the deepest level Then you would not do well with Requiem for a Dream I just look away or take off the earphones. How can you bear to watch and hear somebody snort cocaine?! To be honest it doesn't bother me Injecting is another story UGHHHHHH I RECEIVED TWO EMAILS ABOUT STAFFING AT BOY SCOUT CAMPS FOR THIS SUMMER FUCK NO You can say no...??? Sergio why don't you just get your damn eagle and be done and leave Injecting isn't too bad for me. I think that's because it's normal to receive shots (injections) but not to stick things into your nose? Idk This week I have to call the Tucson Village Farm for an eagle project. That's halfway there. But like if you have track marks and are injecting into a black necrotic pustule, as I have seen show Shown Oh my goodness I just had to look up a picture, didn't I See you're looking more at the effects of long term injection whereas I'm looking at the action itself That's a good point. Though I hate watching the needle being pulled out And the skin snaps back into place So I am going to sleep on that delicious note Good night Sleep right Tight Yes, super delicious Never got that bath picture but oh well haha Next time, next time P Oh right, fuck I'm sorry. I will surprise you with it  When I'm in church Good night and sweet dreams ) Hi!! How was mock trial? Good! I can't talk right now phone almost dead ( Hi Hey what's up Dis dick No actually I just got home Wbu Aw, dis dick hasn't been up (  From where? 
Well... I had global which was absolutely amazing today. Ahmad had nothing to do so we invited him, okay? Originally we were going to talk about Egypt, but somehow we landed on Palestine-Israel, and he just blew our minds. He handled the topic very maturely and professionally.  Then I went to grandpa's and actually just woke up from a nap. Literally  minutes ago Did you have a bass lesson? I was at a birthday party of a family friend. Oh, how interesting. In mock trial we gossiped ridiculously because no one but aramis read the affidavits. Did I wake you up? No those are s  You did not wake me up, I woke up on my own and then proceeded to eat Greek yogurt with blueberries. Oh my goodness, I hate reading over and writing affidavits. What is the case about? It's a police brutality/homicide... Ew I hate greek yog Why the ...? Also were those the papers that your house cleaner threw away? It's just a bit too relevant and passionate a topic that it's strange that they chose it right now Yes but I found them they were somewhat hidden but it's ok Mm I don't think so, but that's okay. Well I mean for half the time we have to defend the cop, and it'a clear he's an ass it's just whether he is a murderer or not You know what Martha's dad told me yesterday morning? First he asked how I did on the PSAT and for my percentile, and then he told me, oh, that means you're smarter than % of juniors. Ohhhh you're defending the cop. I feel like I already told you that... You didn't tell me Is that wrong because SAT isn't a good measure of intellect or that it's mean or....? I don't get it Yes, I told him he's wrong and that I don't agree with him. It pissed me off so much. Why?? Because it really isn't a good measure of intellect, like you said, which is also what I believe. I mean sure but why do you care so much I mean why didn't you just nod and move on Well they are so hard on Martha for her PSAT score, and if I could perhaps dispel the notion that your SAT/PSAT score determines intelligence then maybe they won't be so ignorant. When Martha told me that her mom was binge eating  chocolate because she was upset about her score, I had no idea what to say. Wow... Wtf I didn't know they were so intense Yeah... I felt terrible. But Martha is so oblivious and is really hard on herself, even though the school she wants to go to doesn't even look at the PSAT score? She said it's for brownie points. 
Really, I think BASIS needs to sit everyone down before the PSAT and give y'all a reality check that it's useful for arizona state schools and literally nothing else (ok if you get to the end of the process it's a $ scholarship but literally no one at basis has ever gotten it). It is entirely unimportant and a waste of your time and to prep for it or become upset because it is wholly irrelevant if you do not want to go to a state school (which, if you are up for national merit, would already give you an almost full ride anyway probably) Amen brother.  It's probably because her parents grew up and attended college in Poland, and Martha didn't fully explain it to her parents. Well my parents did in Israel and they retain critical thinking skills about these things Oh okay. You're right. I don't think education systems in those two countries are any different. They all grow up the same, right. Thanks! Jk, but Martha's mom was explaining to me the importance of tests in Poland. I thought you were referring to the fact that they were foreign in general not a specific trait And how they determine college entrance, more so than GPA does. In one sense it's an objective measurement.. I mean it is A standard. If done correctly standardized testing can be a great tool for admission I also agree, but specifically for specialization. A test like the PSAT measures shit. Congratulations just because you know some vocab words and remember your algebra  and precalculus.  Do you think you would feel at all differently if you got  I mean you seemed more than content to study your vocab words and precalc prior to receiving result. Actually, I've thought about this quite a bit. I do think I would feel differently. I think I would be happy for my automatic admission into the UA honors college, however I wouldn't flash it around in people's faces. I was studying for the SAT not the PSAT. Well, wait are you above % And I genuinely enjoyed studying vocab words... Yeah you could get national Hispanic probably Which is also auto admit And same benefits I know... No it's literally equivalent I felt terrible because Reyna got so much lower than I did She barely got  and I didn't want to tell her my score but she kept asking I don't like sharing grades or results when I do better than others Makes me feel like a dick Yeah it's an issue Anyway I'm going to sleep Good night Lol okay Well goodnight then.   Diviya wants me to tell you she's sorry And that she brought it up in passing Sergio wtf I literally didn't tell you guys Pretty sure one of you told me, Joseph did not tell me while camping as he thought Diviya says you were really drunk when you said it Because I didn't hear it from him I didn't even hear that... Like I didn't tell Jennifer anything I really don't remember it and I feel strongly that I didn't And I am so pissed the fuck off that now Joseph is pissed at me and I really remember thinking to myself that that was something I would never tell anyone Diviya says that you and her were really drunk and that she just remembers hearing it Sergio... I really do not remember saying it and I don't know who told me it but it wasn't Joseph. Maybe someone else told both of us while drunk?? Honestly I feel like Jen told me But I don't remember And this is really really irritating I'm very upset  Aimee I literally know nothing about this. I only found out about this today I'm just typing what Diviya is telling me to say Joseph told me you said you heard it from me ??? Heard what??? The thing Diviya brought up Okay I literally didn't find out about anything Diviya said that she heard what you guys did at the camping trip When you were under the influence That we did what??? Can I talk to Diviya? Diviya says she doesn't remember That's bullshit She says forget about it she'll talk to Joseph What did she tell Jennifer that she got so upset about She just said that the boys were talking about how far they have gone During the camping trip OHHHH I thought it was something else. But still I didn't talk about that either Jennifer just got upset that her sex life was being publicized  Ok I did not publicize anything Literally Diviya says yeah And Joseph said something about frequency? I literally know nothing about frequency Oh I was asking about Diviya's story as a joke and Jennifer misconstrued it Diviya says that Jennifer took this out of whack  And that frequency was never mentioned Ok I just don't want Joseph to be upset I really don't recall doing anything.... He was really pissed Okay well Diviya says that Jennifer misunderstood  Ok well Diviya needs to make that really fucking clear.  She wants to know if she should call Jen? I don't care  Can she call Joseph? Maybe she should tomorrow or later so it calms down a bit Wait why was Joseph so mad? What did he say? He said she was very pissed Okay well Jennifer really misinterpreted Diviya's story It was really stupid and nothing to get upset about. Jennifer sent me a bitchy text What did she say??? Hey... So thanks for saying you're not going to tell anybody else.. Diviya said you were a little drunk. 
Also, Aimee, we used to be friends. And we're still nice to each other, but I've heard some of the things you've said about me, and I don't understand why you say such mean or untrue things about me. It's just that the more and more not-nice things I hear about that you've said to or about me or my friends, It's harder for me to feel the friendliness that I used to feel about you.  I don't really know what I'm expecting. All I know is that I try to avoid having enemies or negative presences in my life. I liked when we were friends. 
And I know this is going to sound bitchy, but please think about the things you say about other people. You say so many hurtful things about or to people and its difficult because I want to be friends, but it's hard when I know the things you've said about me to other people.  Honestly, I don't know if this message will help anything or just make it worse, but it's just what I'm feeling.  The only reason I started feeling unfriendly feelings toward you was once I heard all of the hurtful things said about me and about others.  Other than that, I always liked you and thought we were friends.  Anyways.. yeah  Well what will you say? This is so ridiculous Should I even answer No, Diviya really needs to talk to her ugh Like Reyna and I were even there and it wasn't serious Also you replying back isn't going to fix anything Is Diviya mad at me?? She thinks you're mad at her because of this But she said it's just a passing madness  I somewhat am but it's ok Mostly mad at the situation because its so bull This reminds me so much of middle school. Are you feeling okay? Jennifer just asked if she had the right number lol What did you answer  Yes it's so dumb I'm upset but it's ok... I just said yes but that texting you or anybody won't accomplish anything and that nobody wants any problems right now. Can I call you Yeah in like  minutes? I finished What's up Hey, how was it? What were you doing? Just watched a few videos. One of them was  It went fine, I didn't mess up so I'm happy. It was a  min long musical  Dalmatians very cute Lol I've seen that before When I saw the costumes for the Dalmatians, I thought it was the most adorable thing ever, But I'm happy for you ) It was so adorable What are we doing this weekend? Hanukkah or..? Yeah, I think we should do Hanukkah... Do you want to? Also on the th is the th avenue winter street fair If you don't want to go to the Hanukkah thing that's cool  No I do But it's up to you Yeah, of course. Also I would feel bad not going after telling Eva andlissa yes Sure. What time? I forgot FUCK I have a show tomorrow at  Well call is then, it ends at  Call is then? The party starts at . Call is when I need to show up Ok, can I meet you there, then? Yeah sure, are we going to do anything after? Prolly I'm gonna go to sleep. I'm tired and sad so I have no excuse to stay awake. Good night! I'm excited to hang out tomorrow Aww alright, well goodnight and feel better. See you tomorrow.   Hi Hi, I was going to text you earlier but when I was asleep my baby brother disabled my phone for over an hour... Hahaha What's up I kept watching short bus it gets so much weirder I've been babysitting since . Just made breakfast for me and baby brother and I was checking up on the news. Does the whole thing revolve around sex? Now I'm watching The Square. Mm somewhat? It's all very strange. They meet up at this... Sex club? I don't even know what to call it and everyone there is weird as hell What is that about Tahrir? Like all of the characters meet at this club? Yes, pretty much. Yeah they all meet there.  Are you going to church today No church today! My mom went to work this morning Lol I saw that before too! I love that show 
 too, I basically like seeing reaction videos in general. But that video is really beautiful Is richie w you I cried at the last person He's still asleep lol. He will be in his room for hours after he wakes up though. I almost did too, also the second to last Lol I bet he's in that / year old jerk off  times a day phase Is the square worth watching Ew I don't even want to think about that. I accidentally saw his dick sticking out of his boxers a few months ago, ehhhhhh. I think it's more for people who aren't aware of what happened.. Or want to see the revolution from the full perspective of different revolutionists So, not recommended if you have some awareness of what happened? More for future people? When is your mom coming gone Home Yes, like I would recommend it to somebody like Martha who doesn't keep up with Middle Eastern news. The movie just observes the life of protesters under Mubarak and Morsi Or when are you guys going to gpa My mom is coming home at  so I'm probably going to grandpa's around / Oh. My parents went to Phoenix just now so I'm here until  alone P How long will they be in Phoenix? Maybe if they're still in Phoenix we can leave Hanukkah early? Only until around .. ( They are going there to pick up an oven (???!!!???) Hahahahahah what's wrong with the ovens in Tucson? Idk I guess there just isn't one at a price they want idk Why did you even need a new oven? It's for one of the rentals Is it free to attend  Dalmatians? $ They are making bank they pack like  parents in there So only parents go? When is lucky stiff? Nah lots of siblings and teachers too, and friends Lucky stiff is sometime late  idk. I delegated most of the work on it to Garrett    ()/attachment.JPG Shit sorry didn't meant to send that Lol what is that It was from when Isabella and I were volunteering that one day. There is a peach tree in that picture If I went to your house where would I go at ? Who are the people? Are they people you had described? It won't work out, my parents came back, the lady in Phoenix called idk they aren't going today Oh, no they are not. Just people who went to volunteer. My mom wants me to get a ride to the place, but I think it's okay. Ok how is that going to happen? I can take you to the show and then we can go to the Hanukkah thing No I think it'll work out. She will probably take to to basis around ? Yeah that would be fine It will probably end around   Did you finish the square Yes I finished that around . I also watched the Addams family last night Ok coo coo I'm watching dear Zachary and it's so fucking sad I have no idea what that is... This guy is murdered by his psycho ex and so his friend makes a movie about him to show to the son that the ex was carrying when he died  It's a documentary What the fuck But how would he know that the ex was going to murder him? He didn't know? He made it after the guy died He interviewed everyone the guy had known and also had a lot of footage and pictures of him growing up because they made short movies together  Ok yeah that was a stupid question idk why I asked I wasn't really paying attention, sorry How did you hear about it? Sunday  Hi! Hi What's up Just reading el periódico, wbu? Also is Bradford's Christmas party ON Christmas Day? 
You know, it is common in architecture/city planning to demolish or significantly remodel a building around  years after it was built because even for unexceptional buildings, making it past the  year mark tends to make the public think of it as historically significant and require maintenance and restoration which is very costly Lol I texted you right as you texted me No it's on like the st What about banks or restaurants or stores? Do those count too? Or is it just homes and government buildings? You should.... Have a fancy Christmas dinner. No drinking, and if anything then wine during the dinner. And no sleeping over either. I finished dear Zachary (  Mm I'm not sure. I think it's more stores and businesses. restaurants and houses would generally benefit from the history because it is all about image whereas businesses just need the space to work and sell things Mm no thanks I really don't want to have one If it's no alcohol and no sleepover anyone could have it Why wouldn't you want to have it?   Also, do you know any really good news podcasts?! I was searching the Internet all night for one, but to little avail. Holding things like that is just stressful.  Lol no I don't get the concept of podcasts, they seem to me to be a format for amateurish media. Why do you want a podcast I specifically said no sleepover and no alcohol so that it would not be stressful? I don't understand? I just meant like we all bring food and then eat, talk, and leave. From - or something Well, I wanted to fall asleep listening to the news since I was already falling asleep reading it, so... Cos who would even come. Many are out of town, anyway. I think it would be you me Martha Diviya and reyna if there was no partying involved  Lol NPR I guess I would also really want Jay to come. Maybe it could be a MUN thing and invite Hannah and Carly too. Idk, whatever.  Nvm bad idea I guess It's not a bad idea I just am not in the mood really I tried NPR but at  they were just playing Christmas music lol. Alright then, it's cool What are your plans today Mm nothing really, just work on homework? Wbu Nothing really Probably watch a movie that's it I'll probably watch two movies today.  . Love the Hard Way, which Zayna says sucks but the guy Adrien Brody is super attractive. He's in The Pianist. . Last  minutes of Trainspotting  I guess  doesn't really count What is the first one about It is about the story of a petty thief who meets an innocent young woman and brings her into his world of crime while she teaches him the lessons of enjoying life and being loved. Sounds cute? Mm sounds strange and exploitive lol maybe it's done right You know what's so funny We both do things that we don't want each other to know about ? Yeah, you know? Like everybody in relationships does it There are just things we don't tell each other I'm not saying with other people, though. I mean I guess so It's just a strange thing to randomly say Idk I've just been thinking about it wait, are your parents going to Phoenix today? If you're not gonna do anything we should go Xmas shopping and split the cost No idk when they are going Well I'm only shopping for Martha so... It would be a very short trip lol.  Then I guess you can help me pick out gifts for other people to make the trip longer ) And that th Ave festival is today if you're up for that.  It's just that I'm alone w grandpa all day so I'm not going to do anything If you don't want to it's ok though I mean I do but I have some work and I'm tired too, but can I give you a final answer in like an hour Where is your mom today Oh it's okay then, don't worry Her and brothers went home. I stayed to finish work. I don't understand how the wives don't see money missing without the husband bringing any back... The fee is only $. And many don't take prostitutea  Not bringing any back though... Idk  I think many of them don't use the work excuse, or aren't married No I watched the video and the guys said they tell their wives it's a business trip I did too But that was select guys, and some were widowed It's not like they interviewed all of them Anyway, I need to make a senior page today But I don't have any pics so I'm just gonna do something trashy. Ideas? Just put a quote and a pretty nature pic That was the plan Maybe a rap quote? Maybe Tupac   ()/attachment.GIF   ()/attachment.GIF Hahah I realized why the club was called short bus. The short school bus is for the special kids. They are the special kids You still use tumblr for non porn reasons?? The characters all converge on a weekly underground gathering or salon called Shortbus, inspired by the short yellow school buses for challenged students. Yeah I had read about it a few days ago Goddammit At least I was correct   ()/attachment.GIF   ()/attachment.GIF I figured it out by myself #thankssweeney   ()/attachment.GIF Oh those are all porn gifs I did not know Well I haven't seen the movie, gosh Lol I was just proud of me Yes. And I do use tumblr for non porn purposes. Mostly just for fashion, politics, and humor. Do you run into much of the SJW stuff Yeah and it alters my views a bit... So I try to avoid it. I've started following more middle eastern blogs though As if that doesn't alter your views lol What do you mean the SJWs alter your views, though? Ok bitch, at least it's making me more aware. Well you know how the SJWs find a way to criticize EVERYTHING. Literally everything. So sometimes I'll say to myself, wow yeah never noticed that before.. over a really stupid undeveloped argument some SJW makes Well, it's an incredibly biased userbase, so unless you have a carefully curated list of followed blogs.. Not that I care I'm just saying.  Yes!! There was this recent song that was meant to be pro-LGBT and they just tore it apart. So dumb 
True. Idk I just think it's so interesting to see blogs of average Lebanese/Syrian/Egyptian teenagers. On the news we see one side of everything but these are kids who are still in school and live an average life with an average family. Hahahah they tear apart everything. Sometimes even each other. You know, it's crazy to think that the average person inxico earns less than / of the minimum wage level here $ But things are less expensive inxico unless you're buying electronics. Food is soooo cheap And everybody gets their braces inxico Sure but not x cheaper. The standard of living is certainty a lot lower. Like for thexican kids in AZMUN it still costs about $ which is a lot for an averagexican. But they are also all from elite private schools  This aftershave smells like you 
Those kids fromxico were really well off... I befriended two of them and I got to see Itzel's (one of the girls) quince pics which was super expensive. She also travels all over South America and the south of our America. Really? So it smells like laundry 😛 Lol somewhat It is like Gillette laundry Do you wear Gillette!?? 
Not gonna lie that sounds like a dream. I wonder how many of the parents are wealthy through legitimate means. My impression was that many of the wealthy are either related to governmental corruption, monopolies, or cartels The ones I spoke to were very nationalistic and desired to reform the country Many wanted to be cops or politicians  They did not want to leavexico at all Nope, I switch off between Old Spice and Degree. Many government officials work in tandem with the cartel too... It's so corrupt Yeah all the ones I spoke to said that they want to go to college inxico and then continue working inxico You know it's gross when chicks wear right dresses and they cling to the beer belly Diviya /, please don't repeat I mean she doesn't have a beer belly though But a lot of her bodycon garments aren't flattering I'm gonna shout it to the skies I think she got unlucky in fat distribution. It's all hip and below Martha weighs more than me Eh more like waist and below She gets it in all the right places tho  Unlike me ( Jk lol. But yeah I agree. Were both of your parents thin teenagers? Lol you don't even have body fat My mom, yes, she was somewhat anorexic. My dad, yeah, built somewhat like you Ummm yes I do? You don't look at anything on my body besides my dick Strange, that's like my parents but opposite. No! Like you don't have arm fat, the only place you maybe have a little is chest. Literally that's it I pay attention bitch Your dad was anorexic? Haha I was joking about the dick thing Well he was always really bony. He only started gaining weight in his late s. But my mom used to run so her legs look SOOO good  Idk why you think she's fat Well, really, it's because I'm repulsed by her (mostly her views) and that manifests in finding her sight unattractive too That's exactly how it is with Demi My mom's nickname was chichona because she had bigger boobs than her sister Legs snap Let's Lol wtf where did she high school wtf we both sent dick drawings at the same time Lol it was obv the next step Anyway I think I'm gonna start homework soon At . Just have to study Did you finish your senior page? I gave up on it because it required a wide cover photo and it was just dumb so I emailed them and said I didn't want one. I'm not sentimental anyway Oh okay That's kinda a shame but if it works for you then oh well Literally could not make out anything in that snap I know my light here is so bad I'm sorry It's fine I can't leave my room bc my parents have friends over What do you have to study for I'm almost done masturbating anyway Bio and APUSH 
 too But you don't even take long I have been doing this for minutes and minutes 
 too.. What are you thinking about Ummm when I had my hand on you after we finished  And then you put your hand on mine and moved it That's what I'm thinking about Did you want to go again after that? You said no lol so I don't know why I did I wanted to in retrospect Our sexy snap thing failed so much  I'm sorry I wish it didn't It was kinda frustrating me Wtf how am I still going Been like  min Lol me too it was so silly I finally finished Just now Wtf same Like just now I just feel like consistency is key for something like that You need maybe  spare minutes or so That wasn't good for me / Literally such a waste of time. Fuck I'm so stupid What? What are you even talking about Ok I thought we were gonna end up 'snapping' you know, and I would be done That was like  I have wasted all this time just to come and it wasn't even that good Sorry, my fault, I got distracted Well, that's just how life is...  Ok I'm just so upset Why??? You are gonna get your work done anyway And you waste a ton of time doing all kinds of things why so upset with this -phone about to die and family friend took charger, I may not answer- No I just wanted it to be a good orgasm Who else do you think about when you masturbate? Always wanted to ask Oh ok Probably Jacob and Shawn and Henry No I don't think of people I think of actions Or porn. I hit the random button on pornmd and just pick the most appealing of the first  videos Usually I think of memories though Times we did things Moments That's weird. I can imagine anybody I want doing whatever I want So I usually think about people I could too it just doesn't turn me on really I don't fantasize about things far from what I have already done Okay well anyway I'm going to go study and your phone is going to die or whatever. I'm sorry about all that I just feel really shitty and tired Ok ; ( You should listen to Sylvester He makes me happy I need you Disco heat You make me feel Ok, thanks. Maybe tonight I'll listen to it now! He's... Black What did you expect lol His back up singers later became the weather girls (it's raining men) Whaaaat! Well that's a fun little fact Idk he sounded European I'm so mad because my mom decided to come back to grandpa's right now. And then my mom asked if I was mad that she is here and I said yes then she got upset with me And said if it's not nice then why say it Lol why did she ask.  And why are you upset I guess he does. It's a unique sound I mean to say why do you care if she is there   ()/attachment.PNG This is so great, makes me feel like im in Xanadu  She asked because I was being curt Can't study and their presence bothers me I know, that song is definitely the best a real disco classic Why can't you study? Is it the brothers or her Mostly the brother, but she sits at the same table I do and I like to work alone You should tell me a bunch of artists to listen to Horseat Disco? What a peculiar name for an album haha Is that an album name of his? Pretty self deprecating. Ok I'll do that soon, I'm going to sleep. Hope you can study Gut nacht Hahah okay, goodnight b sweet dreams   Hi Hey how are you? How was your day? I'm alright, my day was pretty damn good 
 and sienna watched pulp fiction and actually got work done on history paper. What about you Oh that's good. Bio midterm went well. Was just a really relaxed and easy day for me. Have lots of work tonight though. APUSH and..? - Bio midterm part  tomorrow - physics problems - Chinese passage reading - SEMINAR ESSAY Math? Just finished it like  minutes ago Great I am watching the grand Budapest hotel and it is weird but I like What's it about? 
a fancy concierge is framed for a murder because he is an heir to a fortune. It has so many strange elements. Like all the actors use their normal accents, some are American, others British which has no bearing on where their characters are supposed to be from and sometimes speak poetically, other times like the 's (it's set in the 's) and other times completely modern. Oh that voice things is strange. All I know about the movie is that Saoirse Ronan is in it, and I really like her. She had a facial birthmark shaped exactly likexico These are the kinds of strange details Wes Anderson includes That's so strange hahah. Do they ever explain it or address it? They acknowledge it once but that's it What are you working on now What are some other strange details? Finishing this stupid apush packet. I think I'm going to go to school at  or something tomorrow bc I have lots All the women that visit the hotel are blonde. Why don't you just not until bio? When do you have bio? It's a more prevalent thing in the royal Tenenbaums but there are random things here too   Hi? Hi Are you okay) Yeah I just had to get some national merit stuff done urgently Oh ok, how was MUN? Did you talk to Joseph? No see I ditched MUN to do it Ohhhhh, yeah so many people did. Keizer, Martha, Jen, Diviya, me Then why did you ask if I was okay?? I was just checking on you....?? Ok nvm ???? What??? No, i was just texting you to see how you were Like how we text every day... Nvm ok Lol if you feel like telling me what is was later I'd appreciate What did you do instead of MUN Sorry yeah, I was just with Diviya and Madeleine and Martha Diviya was trying to read our texts  It was just an awk situation but I'm alone now You're so good at knowing what's up hahah Lol you are damn obvious Why did she want to read them Well I wanted to talk about something innocent idk Why?? Ok I have bass lesson must go Oh ok have fun! But she was just trying to see what we were talking about? Idk. She was acting super out of it We went to La Paloma to see the winter formal room and talk about the pricing, food, photo booth, etc. Then Madeleine took Keizer and me home. We had fun in the car though. Cool! What did you guys do So I'm in your area and I have to burn  min... If you are busy it cool Oh cool yeah! Hold on i'll be home soon Yeah?? Ok when Yeah we can leave at  and go to library? I really don't have much hw now that bio is over Oh wait only  min? Yeah.. So then do you still want to or no? Since we only have like  min What are you even doing? I'm ok until  Or  Will explain Mmmm ok so then once we're done can you take me to library? Ok Or back home? I'll be there in like  Ok Basically I had bass lesson early, family friend not home yet Oh ok Here Hi Unfortunately there is no middle finger emoji... Jk haha. Hi. Hope you got there on time. Sorry for being an ass ) I did What do you have left to study/do It's quite alright, halfway done with math!  Umm I have Apush, Lang, math Wbu? I'm leaving now to go home That still sounds like a lot Not really, almost done with apush. That's pretty much all I have. Lol I'm still here But mom is getting me at  finished everything!! I can't believe it. Sex and homework all done by . It must be a miracle. Are you fucking kidding me. There's a ferguson protest tonight in Tucson and they're blocking roads and shit Listen to club tropicana by wham I know right a miracle  Wtf where I forget, but they also said that the protests shut down the streetcar a few weeks ago ??? Fucking blind ass liberals I don't even get it I mean yeah sure, protest on the sidewalk and whatever, but to go out of your way to ruin means of transportation and harass innocent people is just so wrong Religious fanatics don't even create that much of a big deal Also I've heard this song! I really like it ) I think you showed me it What's that website to tell you if a movie is on foreign Netflix? Plus I'm sure it makes a big impact right? Wrong Also everything she wants Moreflicks.com Wow Aimee, look at what they're doing. It's so.. Poignant... So.... Moving.. It's so beautiful how hundreds of white people can lie down on the street... Those legislators are going to remember this next time they're making those laws  #slacktivism Fuck them I hear UC Berkeley and UDub are all about protests Protests are so dumb Except like you know when it is something that can really affect change And needs local media attention Like a rare tree that will be torn down or soemtbing Or like ACT UP! You should read about them they were insane with the protests And theirs were no bitch protests   ()/attachment.jpg   ()/attachment.jpg They were for sure most successful protest group since racial civil rights    ()/attachment.jpg   ()/attachment.jpg This is exactly what I agree with (red ribbon = HIV awareness) 
Yeah in my essay I'm talking about ACT UP! and I just don't understand why we don't see protests like that anymore. Protests about something that could actually be fixed by implementing policies, rather than actions done by racists that can't be changed unless you raise the new generation 'correctly' Well there aren't any issues that significant Is protesting on the street going to bring back Mike Brown? No.  Was not indicting the police officer for killing him wrong? Sure, depends who you ask. But there's nothing we can do about it We just have to educate people, it's not the govts job People cared and devoted time because they and many of the people they knew had an expiration date And many were kicked out of jobs or too weak, so they had time Are millions going to die from police brutality? I think not.. Well it's more protesting the political and racial climate- but that isn't something worth protesting. You can't change that with protest really at all I just couldn't agree more. Maybe as bigger issues like AIDS were starting to receive funding, people just move onto the next smaller issue to tackle Who knows I'm going to watch that movie Reyna recommended, submarine. Yes we will never be at peace there will always be people angry with whatever Tell me how it is 
It's so strange how some people devote their lives to these protests or causes because they're never happy with anything. Like instead of living and focusing on your life and making the most of your life, you're some years old lying down on the street. I just can't believe that these are real people doing this. Are we just never happy with anything? Why even live then if everything is so fucked up? Well, in the same way that some issues are close to our hearts, I'm sure there are some people who are truly devoted to their cause for whatever personal reason. That's certainly a minority though Well, there are  billion people with  billion problems This is one of the dumber ones surely... But if this was a gay discrimination thing where gays were killed by police I don't think we would feel quite as distanced and uninterested Not only is it a minority, but that minority's probably consists of minorities. Yeah *minority Lgbtqqawtfbbqidfk Idek* Too many minorities in one sentence lol How ironic What is your plan for tonight Do not have.. Might watch a movie, might go to sleep, might take a long bath instead of shower  Wbu Well I'm going to watch that movie now, but it seems like one of those teen angst movies. It begins with him saying how we all think we are individuals and blah blah blah I'm a teenager I'm unique Uhhahaiaoagahfuckkkk I hate those I hate them Perks was cute but the teen angst pissed me off I find that the only way to get through life is to picture myself in an entirely disconnected reality wowww much poetic I liked it but the individual dumb shit and the protagonist ughhhh AHAHAHHAHAHA Yeah I can't do this I saw She's the Man and that was dumb but ridiculous Amanda Bynes?!!!? Yes YESSS I LOVE THAT MOVIE I OWN IT And Channing tatum and he was actually pretty cute Lol really  I liked it haha that was my fave comedy back in the day And everybody was so surprised when she showed the goodies on the field I KKOW!! Know And he thought she was gay hahahah Just saying if she was like that at basis or something everyone would figure it out so fast she didn't even really look like a guy Lol yes All the soccer boys ))) Or it could be a Keizer type of situation. You know with the high voice and smooth complexion True But he is somehow still masculine enough Nah, I don't agree. He's way too sensitive and too dependent on the girls. he's only somewhat masculine because we know he actually is a male I meant in appearance Oh yeah. You know he has to shave haha. Well we all are sensitive he is just external about it Like you too lol He does??? Yeah! He has more hair than you No way No way He's like a gorilla ???? On his face?? All over haha But including his face I never thought. I wonder if he will change in college Or like get a gf Or like something I mean he can be sensitive and girly and straight Though when girls say they like sensitive guys they don't mean how he is lol Sensitive guys - listen to their problems and nod your head and reply every once in a while lol Sometimes get a little deep   Basically you Or just like don't spend % of time thinking with dick Lol Think with the other head maybe % of the time Maybe I'll dress more masc in college. Just like normal blue not skinny jeans and sneakers Lol Inversely proportional to mass I can't wait for college I'm going full gay Unleash the rainbow Oh god please no Pls Seen Serj* Don't do this to me Lol what Why no What is it doing to you U r joking, no? Wait you must be You just bitched today about how you dislike the sass of Sara now And see how you were annoying  Lol of course I'm joking. I think I'll just stay the way I am. But I want to have really good guy friends... ( I want to be able to hang out with the boys in their dorm or hang out one on one with a boy for lunch You know If you go somewhere on the east or just more liberal I thought it was liberal here but no. They don't hate but they do judge and treat you different The guys there don't give a fuck Yeah, I knew that just from hearing how the boys were bothered by how much leg I was showing  Well ok  That's kinda different Ok what about boys who are repulsed by anal Or 'gay sex' Which encompasses all male to male action But no lesbian? I was about to say that's a gray zone bc you can't ask them to not be turned way off by gay action but on the other hand we witness so much straight action everywhere and it doesn't get to us Exactly, also some straight couples are into anal unless it's two boys then oh shit it's an abomination My uncle told me that he would have anal with ugly girls so he didn't have to see their face Just thought I would share Has he not heard  Of doggy style?? In Judaism it's all equally not ok ) Goodnight b my eyes are falling Haha I'm sure he's heard of foggy style *doggy omg Guess who's going to hell! Okay good night ) Us ) Let us get lunch? No math counts so I will come by at  Oh ok! I'm up here Come down? It's a mess here I'm in the back lot Hi boo Hyello   ()/attachment.PNG   ()/attachment.PNG Which sounds better?  Why zucchini It is not traditional Usually potato and onion Actually, you're right. And it requires less ingredients. Thank you! Did you light the candles yet? Great! Yeah we did What's up! Is it something short? Also how does dreidel work? Are there prizes? Haha I'm finishing math homework. It's all I have! Then I'm going to make some latkes and cucumber dill dip. Wbu? 
Yes it is only  minutes or less. There are a couple ways to play, we usually just see whose can spin for the longest. Otherwise, the letters on each facet represent a game condition ( win , win , nothing, lose / of total) . You win chocolate coins I'm watching risky business We NEED to watch moonrise soon Do you ever win haha? Also what letters are on the dreidel? I know! We should watch it over break Today is the first day I've ever cried from an onion I'm so sorry (. Is the onion ok? Yes I won yesterday The letters are נגהש outside of isreal and נגהפ in Israel because the former stands for great miracle happened there and the latter stands for a great miracle happened here We should Yes the onion is fine! I'm going to make you some latkes too ) What is the great miracle that happened here ... Hannukah is... You know the candles and shit ))) I hope they turn out great Do you have movie suggestions for me My list,  watch, is  short  Of full Because my lists are  long Always Fight club? Have you seen it? Sorry if I don't reply, im cooking ( Nope! I meant personal recommendations! Like ones you like Preferably not educational or documentary.. Oh okay! Can I tell you in half an hour? Ok! Also, there is a boy at basis that looks just like Ellar Coltrane (boy from boyhood) Somebody besides Nico (white one)? Who is it? Have you seen Bachelorette? I liked that movie. Aimee look, I'm like Judaism now.   ()/attachment.jpeg And if you save some for me I too can be jew. How are they? Ok I added to list Idk his name sorry Darker skin, but honey hair They're pretty okay, not as good as the party ones though I like how you told me no documentaries lol My mom makes the best like goddamn Lol I know you Gotta be targeted or you will give me some weird Syrian bird shot Shit* Hahahah okay maybe Lebanese because that's my new obsession These latkes are so shitty ( What went wrong   Lol when you said pretty ok it was clearly code for shit The party latkes were not even good Sorry- Lebanese male models who sing with babies I thought the party ones were good because they are the only ones I've ever had You probably saw the pic and judged me so hard Don't worry in baby voice was so funny haha Eh the pic is blurry but looks fine Lol what? Yeah from that baby Arabic song Oh, yes! So Goodnight Country bumpkin (get it cos you are a fag) Hahahahahah Fuck you ) Goodnight habibi. now I will go watch a movie because I'm all done with my cooking yayyy  Because I had never told you some of my favorite movies Out in the Dark, West Side Story, Kill Bill Vol.  Also I like Fatal Attraction and Beauty and the Beast Thanks!! All now on my list How is your evening? ) Really great! Finished Pulp Fiction so I'm starting Love the Hard Way, and I'm at chipotle right now. And yours? Good! Had a great conversation with family friend. He cool. How did you like pulp fiction?? And how is the other movie You guys are bougie bitches Pulp fiction was so good. I thought it was cool how the movie was only over the span of two days and was segmented into the chapters. Well I'm only like  minutes in haha Because we like chipotle? Actually it's just me who likes it. Mom doesn't as much. Well because you guys eat out a lot Mostly I wish we had analyzed Pulp Fiction in cinema last year or in some English class It's damn cool Not too much lately since we've been with grandpa, but yeah. I thought it was crazy when he accidentally shot that black guy in the backseat... Just the way they reacted to it and like how the dirty car was more important than some person's life I'm more into analyzing motives of the characters rather than the cinematography. Hi I took a nap Sorry I am up now!! All of it as a whole! You see how it interconnects. Fascinating   ()/attachment.jpeg So turns out I am giving gifts tomorrow... Already have Zayna, Madeleine, Diviya, and Martha's ready My mom got super excited and was helping me pick things out for people. She also got me candy canes and wants me to make cookies And she knows you're Jewish so she gave me this Passover thing lol idek what it is Lol! Wait on giving mine lets exchange later. It's very thoughtful of you I was not planning on giving you yours tomorrow haha I wanted to give it to you in private Ok actually I'm just gonna go sleep I thought I could power nap but no Ok great Guten tag Good night! ) maybe see you tomorrow? Never! Jk, probably Hahaha alright well   Hi I left bc I had to go to bathroom urgently... Lol Omg I was looking for you all over the place, I felt like such an idiot But I found sienna and she told me you left I have a present for you from Martha. I'm sorry   ()/attachment.jpeg Aww Madeleine sent a card to my house   ()/attachment.jpeg ?? What is it?? Oh sorry, I thought it sent   ()/attachment.JPG Palestinian necklace ....... Who is that from And are you going to wear it That is disgusting Btw those are two different letters lol. Madeleine did not send that. It's from Sara. Isn't wearing something like that to school a bit politically charged? Lol see that's what I thought at first Yes absolutely. You would wear it elsewhere? Quite frankly, I would be scared to wear it anywhere because of how sensitive the topic is to people And I told her that, but she said if I wear it on th Ave then people will give me high fives  But you agree with it enough to consider wearing it if not for controversy? Nico tried to talk to me today but couldn't get out any words it was funny Aimee what kind of question is that lol He tried talking to you? You don't even have a class together though? He wanted some pics with me I was looking for something in the MPR and he was standing there Well what do you mean he tried talking to you? Did he actually say anything He like smiled and then he was like hey and I was like hey and he looked like he was gonna say something so I waited and then he didn't He had asked me yesterday if I was still w you Did you take pics w him Well yeah I wasn't going to say no. That's really rude.  We also took a group selfie with Connolly Cool! What did you do all day Cool? Mmmm no. It was weird.  
Played cards and then cards against humanity-ish w/ Nathaniel and joann. Finished Gattaca. Played Rock Band w/ Aaron, Hayden, Hannah, and Geneva. We sang and danced to rock songs, it was fun. Ate lots of food and opened presents. Then in language we just took pics and edited pics Wbu?   ()/attachment.JPG His mouth was full with my candy cane It must be pretty small since it all fits in his mouth That's sounds like a good last day I watched pulp fiction w sienna and saw the band concert He was on the last bit of it Did you guys finish the movie?? Also I had fun bc I spoke Spanish almost all day since my friends were in Zeitler's class Mmmmmmmhmmm No we had maybe  Min left She is so fucking nice  Love the dra Mmmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm What are you doing today? Nothing at all, currently watching boogie nights. Wbu  Never even heard of that.  I'm watching The Craft and then going to some ITE party with Isabella. Pay day today It's about 's porn industry The craft? Hey, Sophia asked if I wanted to hang out tonight (don't worry, at all) is that ok? My aftershave smells like you ) The Craft is some teen witch bitch movie from the s. Yeah, idk why you had to ask for permission Not permission, but I'm ambivalent and if you were uncomfortable w it I would say no No it's fine. Even if I was uncomfortable, which I'm not, I don't have any right to restrain you from having fun and going out. What is the ITE party?? Well we could invite friends and family to this party we were having for the internship I finished up. What time Why..? Because I want to go if possible It starts at  but idk when it ends. Unless you do not want that Aimee it's okay, you can go out and have fun. I'm not upset I swear No, no Sergio listen I'm meeting up with her on th for food It would be fun to go hang out with you guys until dinner time, no? I'm not changing what I'm doing for you Unless you don't want me to come, which is fine I only RSVP'd for one person, I'm sorry. I didn't think it was something you'd want to go to. Ok  I'm sorry It's fine  Where are you going to eat? Caruso's No jk cafe passé Oh ok, sounds cool. Btw The ecoprograms that ITE do look really cool. Do you actually have to do all the prerequisites they list on the site to do the more advanced ones if you are in the top age bracket?  Well they make exceptions for people who have been involved with them in the past and give them priority. But for prerequisites you could always lie, idk. Haven't participated in any ecoprograms yet. Well they are like, do  of the level  programs to do level , etc. for  levels.. Oh well then I'm sure you should do the level  programs first and stuff. I'm going to start some up after break. Ok well good night No, hi I'm still out I will talk to you in a bit   You up? Yes How was your thing? Good how was yours Fine, a couple interesting things . Bella Ruhl texting me confessing her love and it was all very strange . Sophia is genderqueer Anything interesting at ITE? Not really. Talked to people, ate tamales, gave my presentation, got paid. I don't even know what that means I honestly don't either I didn't want to be mean or anything but I don't really understand How much did you get paid? Are you upset w me you are being curt? Sorry if misinterpretation ( Well no, but I just don't know what to say.  I've been playing this stupid game with jay, Nathaniel, Diviya, and Martha all night. And I finished The Craft, half of The Blue Lagoon, and right now I'm watching Sin City Happy? Jk, the happy was a joke. What do you mean confessed her love? I've loved you since the start, since we taped out that set and you were so enthusiastic about the rain What game are you playing? Evil Apples, like cards against humanity  What did you say I said I had no idea. Sorry. Oh  Like an app? That's really sad... Did she reply to that? Yes, an app We've stopped playing though and have been chatting Jay is going toxico tomorrow His first time Yeah the rest of it was really sad too. It was just all sad.  Lol I bet he will find a way to get fucked up. I hope he has a good time.xico can be very cool Do you want to meet up sometime this weekend I just can't believe you replied like that. I would be pissed off. Well there was more to what she said He's going with family... Taylor was in church camp, didnt stop him. It was like x longer. It was overwhelming. There was no way to react Sure Oh well. Also it turns out I'm going to the party tomorrow. But jen and Zayna and Bella are going and jen is sleeping over Idk about Zayna and Bella, I didn't ask Ok, lets talk about it tomorrow maybe? I don't think I will go though I don't really care either way I guess.  I'm going to go to sleep and I hope you sleep well, prince Okay   ()/attachment.jpg We'll talk about it tomorrow then, but it would be sad if you don't go You should really watch Sin City but I don't think you could handle it Anyway goodnight ??? I couldn't handle it?? too gory Lol watch battle royale and tell me I can't do gory Alright, night Good morning,  Have you seen Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet? Also would you like to come over to Diviya's tonight? Veris' got cancelled so we're doing our own little thing. No I haven't, is it good? What happened? Ok maybe. Also, when should we watch moonrise It's funny bc it's modern but they speak the way the book was written. And it's a rivalry between two mafia families.  Nobody knows what happened, jay just told us in our game chat. He thinks it's a lie though and only wants the boys over  What days are you free this week?   ()/attachment.PNG I'm free all of them.  HAHAHAHAHA Tell her no, we promise lol Yeah but then would jay not be invited? Sounds like a cool movie Haha I already told her no, we would do it beforehand No, jay just left forxico ( Oh right  Alright! My only thing scheduled for this week is a meeting I have at  am and pm on monday. Other that I'm free. Great! Btw you should listen to some music by Heatwave Grooveline, Boogie nights  So, when do you want to meet up What would we do at Diviya's and who would it be Okay, I'll listen to it!  Well my mom leaves for work around  so we can leave at  and then get to Diviya's at  or something? There's only drinking. Diviya's mom can provide some. Basically everybody on the game chat plus Seth, Madeleine, and Ale but minus Jay  Wait Diviya's mom is staying there?? This is ridiculous lol. Ok fun No, she's going to Keshav'a for the night Wait Zayna + company? *keshav's Lol she's a champ Ok  No bc Joseph and Leo probably won't go But even if they go it shouldn't matter yeah? Mm not really I guess I mean you will avoid each other anyway haha What's up? I'm about to get a haircut Wbu Oh yay! Are you getting a dye job? Making cookies No, just a blow job Eh I wouldn't even be surprised anymore Yeah, I'm really over the dye. The blow dryer adds enough    ()/attachment.gif Adds enough? What were you trying to accomplish with the dye? What is that food Schena? I was just continuing the joke idk.  It's a slow cooked dish with wheat, sweet potato, eggs, beef, potato Sometimes other things You cook it generally like  hours and eat on  morning I have a math degree. I'm very sharp   ()/attachment.jpg But I looked it up and can't find anything? Are you sure that's what it's called? It's also called hamin For Hanukkah?  Schena is a transliterated Moroccan word I think? Perhaps archaic. Culture has changed much since  No Just every  Maybe it's from Yemen. I do not know. Yemen has the best food Too bad you're not  acute-ie. ( I think you should do Yemen for Global If you were to go to synagogue would you go on ? We have been doing too many Middle Eastern countries lately Mm probably  Oh Or Uzbekistan  Or something It's interesting Armenia Sunday    ()/attachment.jpg   ()/attachment.png The first pic Is how I imagine your dad She is just letting the food go cold Did you sleep and eat yet? Mm I wish that's what he looked like. I ate Wbu   I have used over  GB of data since I first got my phone... Oh my god Wait since when is that And how much do you get/month Sunday  I didn't have service I didn't have service But now I do I guess But now I do I guess Which is strange but I'll take it Hi Hi I know ugh I know ugh What did you do today What did you do today Well, we went to this lake, and it was frozen over! So we threw rocks at it... Real mature I know but it was fun Also sledddd Sledded And snowball fight And this dumb kid fell through the ice cos he jumped That sounds really awesome. Basically my winter last year minus the lake. And I think there was crying from our snowball fight bc they were too hard.  Was it your first time doing anything today Seeing a frozen lake! Did you guys go on it or just throw rocks Wtf Apollo Creed did not win We went on it like briefly What is that The champion from rocky. He shouldn't have won. Tre from Boyz n the Hood is so cute  That movie ( I think it's so important Like as a cultural statement And I'm here watching horrible bosses  I could not agree more, and it's still particularly relevant today. I really like it. I wouldn't have watched it if you didn't  It's scary how easy people succumb to peer pressure and how it ruins them. Have you finished it How were things with Boy Scout boy No I'm  min into it. Mm he was okay. We were partners for the pillow fight and made our fort together. Since we finished before everyone else we just sat there and talked. That was all. I hung out with other Boy Scout boys for the most part haha. Oh. It's really great. Were you the oldest one there...? Not that that sounds horrible just not something normal  year olds do at sleepovers.. Boy Scout boy is also .. Actually, you know that kid who says he's a satanist? Ben? He was there. All the boys who played were either  or older. We did normal stuff too, like watch Sherlock Holmes and Young Frankenstein And actually, remember the republican kid who wanted me to send pics of him pray? Him and I had a great discussion lots of things, like racism and The Interview. We even made fun of some movies as if we were feminazis and pointed out the dumbest shit haha *about lots of things Skylar.. What the fuck. He's an asshole His name is also Ben I heard my brother from his room ask, Siri, am I going to die alone? Yeah... He went through this phase where he wanted to be called Skylar. He also tried to do something with a dead rabbit, idk. He really freaks me out... Did the gf dump him He's a really freaky and annoying and gross kid IMO He's a Boy Scout?? My brother has been on the phone with someone for the past two hours. I don't know what's going on in his life. 
He really is.. I don't know what to make of him. But he joined our Boy Scout troop around Halloween time. And this morning, we were going around talking about the latest we've stayed up and he said  days to watch a show. When we asked what show he gave us this glare and said, Just. A. Show. And he was talking about the feeling of burning hair and what the smell is like. ???!!! He sounds like the opposite of the kind of guy who would join the scouts Damn this movie. He was wrongly suspected and almost killed because he was driving that blue Volkswagen. I think it's his dad who is making him join because the dad is trying to become active and attend the meetings. 
Could you imagine if we lived like that? If we were raised in a neighborhood with helicopters constantly flying around and police cars patrolling every corner. And a neighborhood where the compromise is death. Where we constantly need to prove to other people we are worthy or more superior than another. We are so fucking lucky Or rather they are unlucky... It's a very rare situation It's horrible though That those who pretty much try to avoid it can make one bad choice and.. Or just be at the wrong place at the wrong time Sometimes it's not about choice Yeah / How are you guys watching Horrible Bosses ? It's not on DVD yet, is it? 
You know, I don't think these days there is anywhere as terrible as that. Compton is different now, with the crack epidemic out. In general LA is different. Manufacturing is gone. Hispanic people are in, black people are out. Not saying that is causal, but the demographics ARE very different Or at least not areas so large + in one area in that fucked up condition in LA then So you think a change in demographics, i.e. a more prevalent Hispanic population, significantly reduces criminal activity? No no no Exactly what I was trying to say- it isn't causal Last night we were talking about white privilege, but the ex scout master's white son who is  told us to shut up and said, does it affect you? No, so shut the fuck up and I don't want to hear it. It's not important. I just thought that was interesting He doesn't even know what affirmative action is and told me to shut up when I tried explaining it for the sake of my argument 
Not that I doubt it's existence but I think this whole privilege thing is blown way out of proportion. First I thought I didn't get it cos I'm white, but I'm subject to a lot of the other minority things they talk about privilege for- not Christian not straight etc.  Not saying it doesn't exist but I don't know why it has become such a buzzword and point of debate. There isn't really jack we can do about it like at all.  It's kind of like when people insist being trans is a mental illness. Okay, I'll accept that argument if you so desire but what is the purpose? Insurance covers medicine for bipolar people.. 
Well treatment varies on the type of privilege you're subject for, like sexuality or religion or race. Obviously some things are more controversial to people than other things, and the point of the argument was to recognize how discriminatory we are towards people who aren't considered ideal. And yeah there isn't much we can do about it, but we were having fun and spreading awareness. So overall you had a good time? I guess so. There were no water bottles though (  All there was to drink was soda. And priscilla snapchatted me from Anthony's phone, which was nice bc I haven't talked to her in forever It was my first time playing risk and I got all of North and South America Are you? Not really. I wish I was home. I dislike these people.. 
 I love risk How is she Why do you dislike them? How many people are there? Any kids? Yes! We must play sometime.  She's good I think. Not much you can say over snapchat hahah 
 people. I think.  kids besides me but all under . I'm just over the family appropriate bs. Like the adults keep it all very PG too and don't say or do anything interesting... At all.  I can enjoy many things without intoxicants, like Madeleine's party, but I can't tone it down to age . I've watched  movies this break! Hahahahahahahahah that's surprising, didn't know you could do anything besides watch movies and indulge.  But really that doesn't sound too bad. I mean what do you expect the adults to start doing? Beer pong? Wow thx. No I expect them to have intelligent conversation, or watch a cool movie or... Something ya know Hot leg Hot leg And love the movie And love the movie I am about the same. I will count. Know it is above  I am about the same. I will count. Know it is above  Do they just not feel like intelligent conversations are appropriate or do they not have time bc they're watching the kids? The movie thing would piss me off, but I mean you were watching Horrible Bosses  so Not exactly the most appropriate  Wow, all you care about is the leg. Not my heart. Just the body not the mind I am watching it alone Hot leg eh Fuck the body screw the mind I am on the th now Why did you choose to watch that of all movies?! I expect better things from you Dunno it was popular I'm on my th, suck it Maybe I won't Leg boy American eagle fake fur bitch ) Watch Manhattan Kate Winslet reminds me so much of Madonna  She is like Madonna kinda Really like her Don't get why she isn't a bigger star It will be at the top of  Watch Sexism is hot Sexism is hot Sergio you are inferior to women. You don't even know how to use a car Sergio you are inferior to women. You don't even know how to use a car Bella does! Bella does! They have similar faces.  And she was so good in Eternal Sunshine, even though I only got an hour in ( Looks like somebody is asking for a spanking Omg I remember in grade school my dad told me that if any woman said they were better than me, I just reply at least I can pee standing up Yeah, you, ya bish Klajbor...? At least I can give birth to children and continue the human race. -women At least I can give birth to children and continue the human race. -women We don't need any more of those animals. They're already destroying this earth. At least I can play with my own boobs -women You play with mine lol. I've been thinking about that today for some reason. 
 In a positive way? Yes haha, I enjoy it. But I felt like you were only doing it because I enjoy it. I didn't know you enjoyed it I do it for me, but if you don't mind it that's a plus What about the nipple thing? I don't like saying it haha bc there are some things that sound weird when describing but in practice are very nice I guess that's more equal but I still like doing it. Especially if you stay still so that I can actually have method  Do I move around too much or something? This is good that we talk it out for next time. And what do you mean method haha You will see. Lol next time we have more extended foreplay Preferably when I'm on too Too Top Are we serious about going up the mountain this week? Just for a day? I'm really anticipating this extended foreplay and for you to be on top ;)  Like I'm actually hard Usually takes more to do that Perhaps, it depends on if I'm feeling better and if parents agree, but I'm serious about it, I was thinking about it today I was thinking about it, and this next time, I want to be aggressive with you, and like pin you down and shit Some of my favorite memories with you are when you point out the plants and trees. Fuck. Yes. Oh my goodness that would be the hottest thing ever. We could probably stay late enough to see the sunset and then drive down Mm I think if my parents agree they would definitely want me not driving in the dark. Maybe we can drive down a bit before and catch sunset at agua Caliente I could like pull you out of your pants while holding you down and then ride... That would be awesome Oh we get all aggressive and wrestle like they do in brokeback mountain hah Fuck yeah exactly This is going to be great if your parents agree! I can bring a tent and we can do a picnic kind of thing Followed by rough and aggressive sex I thought you didn't like being on top I suggested it once and you said you really didn't like it I like it in concept, I just think I need more practice.. Don't have he method down The Yes! In the forest-y part, but not the snowy part Definitely ) but perhaps we can wonder off to the snowy part and play if you want to Unless you've had enough by the end of this trip haha You're always welcome to practice your method... And we can play a board game! Yeah sure, maybe  night? Or ? Risk or whatever else you want  Ya! Sergio, I think this is the longest I've gone without jerking in so long Which is only like a day and a half but I want you, like damn 
 night as in tomorrow haha?  I want more than just a few hours with you  Hahahahahaha During the sleepover I kept thinking about grabbing your ass Idk why that specifically, but I really wanted to Do you sleep in a room alone? Maybe I can ease some tension... Via snapchat hah I am in a room alone right now but no lock  But you should do it Push my limits haha Yeah tomorrow You should grab my ass when we see each other  But don't you get home late tomorrow? / No, not at all I think  would be better if that's alright? I'm sorry Should be home before , possibly as early as  Yeah it is better You have scouts right No scouts was cancelled because of the holidays Well we can do  and have more time to prepare and stuff You tell me some food you really like and I'll try my best to make it I'll grab it real hard next time I see you ;) I'll send snaps in a while if you're up for it Totally up. Lets just play board games, don't wanna pack too much in! Food for mountain picnic Oh ok so then how's it going to work? What days are we doing what? Dunno. Lets talk tomorrow?  That was very satisfying for me My Internet here is so fucken slow, it'll be a miracle if I can load the video in the next half hour Idk if you got the video and stuff haha Oh I'm sorry (  I redid the video quite a few times until it was me jacking off nice and slowly Hahahahahja Standing in anticipation OMG it loaded Gonna watch Hahahah Probably wasn't all that exciting but oh well   Niceeeeee Lol you liar That's what a  year old boy replies with after a girl sent a pic of herself with a bra on No actually Or maybe even just lifting the shirt a bit Lol  We are at the point where first base is anal You sending a vid of that is like a bra pic for a boy who has seen vanilla porn, and yet, I was really into it Cos you good b, you real good Unfortunately I can only send  seconds Did you... Do anything? If it's not obvious, delete these texts One step ahead of you bb Ugh god I fucking want to, but I can't risk it Do you sleep alone? No, on the sofa, and there's another sofa with someone on it sleeping Lol we just planned a drinking Skype night for  Over evil apples chat A what? So basically we drink on  night and then all Skype each other haha And then we're gonna watch a movie or something Does anyone other than you Diviya and I have alcohol? Can I join this...? So far it's just me and jay, and Martha says she'll think about it. Diviya said no. Why did Diviya say no No idea. Maybe she really is giving it up Maybe she doesn't want to drink alone Yeah it would be strange doing that while living in an apartment W your mom next to you  but jay told me he wouldn't mind doing it just with me Are we really not doing anything for New Years It's a travesty They actually wanted me to ask you but I didn't bother bc you said no more parties  Well If it was a really small group of us maybe.  But literally like  or less So idk probably not Anyway tho I gotta go Goodnight I love small parties Bbbbbbbbbbbbbb I don't get the obsession with inviting the whole th grade   Okay! Goodnight < Upi loves Upi loves Haha what I don't even know how you came up with that name 
 random letters more or less Are you already on your way back? Yep When was the last time you went to Israel? Have you ever been in Israel while something was going on, either in the city you were visiting or another? Also why did your parents decide that Tucson was the ideal place to start a family? Hi sorry just got service I last went   Once I was in a restaurant, and there was a news flash that a nearby restaurant had exploded. Later turned out to be natural gas, but suspicious and probably linked to organized crime Also once we were there in  days before the war They didn't decide. My dad's job just brought him to Tucson Plus my mom wanted to go to UA, had one of the top PhD programs in her field (Management Information Systems. Don't ask cos I have no idea what it really is)   ()/attachment.jpg   ()/attachment.jpg Why would you guys go there in  when something like that was about to occur? Lol so then do you know what your mom does? Other than writing really technical papers. Is that the frozen lake? It looks very thin. No wonder he fell in haha. The first picture is the best. So what are our plans for this week? Don't really have any. Yes it's the lake, it was thin at some point, pretty thick (in+) at others 
Well we didn't know it was about to happen... Basically my mom didn't bring me to Israel between  and  for fear of conflict but decided it was long enough and had been decently stable. So we went. And it was fine, but after we left it wasn't No, I meant the plans we were making for the mountain and board games. Oh. Yes What games? Risk requires more people I probably have a chess and checker set around somewhere Hmmm what else I kind hate those games lol We can go to bookmans and buy a board game? Maybe a ouija board! When I get home I'll check what I have-- I have a lot Wanna save $ But if not, sure Ouija sounds cool Our friends are driving in another car and their brakes somewhat broke.  Ouija was a joke, but you should check I was told never to mess around with ouija boards Oh I thought you've been home since  lol If shit went as I desired and thought, we would. They left late and decided to stop at every place possible. So we won't be home til  at the earliest Lol why no ouija Oh I thought you've been home since  lol I finished Titanic, Little Town of Bethlehem, and now I'm on Beverly Hills Cop. Yayyy Hahaha. What do you mean stop? Like for potty breaks? No I mean to see obscure monuments Tell me if Beverly Hills cop is good Haha we can do ouija if you want to. But what if it actually works... Such as? It's your stereotypical crime comedy Nothing spectacular 
 vista points, we drove  minutes on a dirt road leading nowhere, we stopped at this national monument land bridge but it was a  minute hike to it, so they went for  min and gave up and came back, at a cost of like $ Wtf. That sounds like such a waste of time and money. Yes Emily, we saw a national monument land bridge. I know, you're just jealous my kids got this once in a lifetime experience. The rest stops are fine though. I always get my rest stop Doritos. No rest stops lol Literally more None Have you ever gotten off in a public bathroom? No.......???!!! Also there should be rest stops..? It's not that unusual actually. Last year I was super horny / so I did it everywhere We were not on major interstates, so there were little towns, but we didn't stop there. Where all did you do that....? Are you joking The Bank of America, Baggins, federal buildings And many more places I assure you Those are just a couple I remember I am not joking... I knew about THE Bank of America Why couldn't you just hold it in til you got home That's pretty gross b Like what if I sit on the toilet and there's dried cum on it That's nasty Did I actually tell you about the Bank of America? Yes With grant, no? Well what can you do when you have a hard cock in a public bathroom Gosh I don't know Glory hole? Idk I was like barely  You don't even use public bathrooms so lucky you ) With Grant???? And I'm too scared of glory holes. What if they're a biter or have a dirty mouth. Bleh. I do! Just not at school I thought there was some story that he was workings there or something Lol fair enough I would probably suck a glory hole dick if conditions were right Clean etc. Oh, right. I've been in the Walmart bathroom with you haha. Yeah, he was working at a federal building. The story was that I called asking for my mom but he answered. But when I jacked off it was a different story I was sent by my mom to go to the th floor or something to get some clothes for a client And then I had spare time so I jacked off in the bathroom And now you sometimes don't jack off for a couple days and then you couldn't keep it in for a few hours I would not go near a glory hole unless I was in some  star hotel or something. Well I'm having sex regularly so there's no need! I did last night though. I wouldn't care if I lost my virginity to some guy in the back of El Super Is that something I said? Yeah, you said that when we were talking about how I lost my virginity to you. God I'm brilliant It's true tho I wonder why someone would drive that off into a lake What do you mean you're brilliant? It's just a really funny statement IMO Back when Anthony and I used to do those Skype sessions and whatnot He told me I could give him head But then he got really sad and said he was crying  So of course I asked what was wrong And he told me that he couldn't do it. I was just a child and that I deserved so much better  And that I should wait for it to be special I thought that was really considerate  -sorry- He said that he feels guilty for robbing my childhood  To be honest I thought you weren't a virgin Well, in retrospect what he did is really fucked up even if you did want it I have a responsibility to not do anything with th graders even if they go after me Though in your case you were not an innocent kid at all before him I'm not upset with you or criticizing you, I just wanted to share that.  It really means a lot now More than it did at the time. Yeah I understand that But he did let it go relatively far still.. He really beat himself up about it after we ended things... And he apologized all the time And he suggested I get with Shawn lol. It was all very dramatic His birthday gift to me was his dick th birthday present whoooooo Lolllll Seriously though you don't have to buy me anything, a dick in a box really would make an alright th Didn't you play with his balls or something? But you didn't blow him? No, the most we did in person was touching and making out. Although he would steal my phone sometimes and I would get on him to get it back but he still had it Are you joking No I think it would be funny Even if not a surprise I'll do that for Valentine's Day ) Lol ok I'm jk that's trashy I guess I could for your th along with real gifts I don't care! Have you ever had someone to give things to for Valentine's Day  Yeah but not like in a romantic way I don't think    ()/attachment.JPG I'll make this a poster Or a shirt Like an all over shirt.  When is that from BASIS should have used that picture instead of using Dun We were in the park while it was raining The wild basis senior And you took two pictures and made one my background haha Oh when I was in your arms Yesss did you change it In my arms? You were holding me We stayed in the front seat the whole time Oh that time I really want to do that ( I did change it because I was afraid my mom or brother would see it I just really want you!!!!!! COS YOU 'SHAMED O ME Jk He's funny And chubby Haha I'll change it back to a nicer picture Of you No no no it's fine lol I was joking I'm trying to get him into more feminine toys  Hey, don't touch me there!! Hey! It's my no-no square -what the kids have been singing for the last  days Like what? Actually it's stop! Don't touch me there! That is my no-no square Haven't heard that in years Like this my little pony doll we have haha I meant stop don't touch me there, stop it's my no-no square that's what they said. Without the second stop it isn't a good song And when we play with dolls I say it's okay for the boys to kiss Your mom bought him a pony doll? I don't think they get the gravity of the song Lol next time we mess around STOP DON'T TOUCH ME THERE!   ()/attachment.jpg I think he got it on accident from a happy meal lol. I don't even know where that song originated from  Kids don't understand the gravity of ring around the rosie  We have so many things to say next time we mess around haha What else Oh hell no Bitch  year old stealing my girl Well I remember agreeing on saying some funny things during sects haha For some reason he's been calling me his girlfriend all day Ah new jacket Old jacket And flat hair. Is that new? Nope, lazy day And no supplies in cabin Sects I wrote that on purpose because I felt like it And I was gonna make a joke but I forgot it ( I'm going to get a haircut this week I can't do this anymore What are you getting It's funny that you always ask that question because it's the same haircut all the time  And whenever I ask what I should get you don't know This time I know You should get your normal cut My brother is such an asshole ? We were eating and then he randomly says so what is it? A boy or a girl? It's not a boy because it had female part so what is it And then I told him he's a disgusting person and he said I'm disgusting? And laughed Which brother lol 
 year old one Lovin the it nice finishing touch I told him that it is for animals then he told me to shut up He is such an idiot Eh, that's not news I just don't understand why the fuck he had to bring it up Of all things Yeah really Now he locked himself in his room And he grabs my Alex's arm and yells at him He's just like his dad That couch is a crime Poor Alex He is so cute The floral couch haha? Our aunt bought it when she lived here. It was her bed and then when she moved out she never took it You have no idea how I much I wish he was away from all of this depravity I love him so much so I spend lots of time with him bc I don't want him to end up like Richie  Well, he will have so much time alone with your mom if you don't stay in town (  It also upsets me because she is working all the time and doesn't read with him or do any fun parent things like she did with me. Like I used to have schedules on the refrigerator and little writing exercises and interactive computer games Anyway I'm sorry Are you home yet? Just got home That's unfortunate  Can he read yet Great!!!! Hopefully you can shower and sleep I can't No water Pipe burst ( He can't read yet... While you were gone?! No, just before we left He is  he should be somewhat reading, no??? We wanted to get it fixed while we were out but it was weekend How long will it be until it's fixed then? Exactly ( he should be reading. I sit with him sometimes and I go over his alphabet and the sounds that each letter makes But I wish my mom did that too. She can't just depend on having him learn at school. She should want him to get ahead. Especially if he's going to the basis kindergarten Dunno, hopefully tomorrow.  Hopefully basis kindergarten will give him the push he needs. I'm sure they don't expect you know much going in I wonder what the curriculum is for the kindergarteners. Did you ever see that movie kindergarten cop? That movie scarred me as a child  Have you jacked off yet Good point! I'll do that I have not You'll watch the movie? Arnold Schwarzenegger is in it hahaha. I'll jerk Ugh I really want to have sex with you 
 too!! I can't believe you came last time It is true Fuck it I'm going to jack off too  Dooooo itttt I already am haha So are your family friends staying for New Years? Do you make resolutions? Yes, leaving morning of jan  I don't Do you Hi sorry I just finished. No, but I think it's funny to hear other people's resolutions and then bring it up months later when you see them forget about it. I did resolutions like two years ago. I think it's cool though that people use the new year to say they'll stop acting like assholes or lose weight I'm gonna watch the interview tonight! On what medium  It's called putlocker. But it's in HD and everything, very nice. 
 Oh yeah you spoke of it No, it's how Jay watched it and I decided to do the same. Eminem is in it lol. Eminem is gay in the movie I mean, it's kinda like I been playin gay peekaboo Haha Hahahahahja When you see people Who are hipsters of  Long hair Tevas Earth colors Cargo pants What about them?   ()/attachment.JPG Just a rare sight now See them in sprouts all the time Wow Will be back in a bit going out Ok cool   Hi Hey What'd you do Saw this movie troll  Oh you went w Sophia Yeah Twas sudden again  What's the plan tomorrow No idea I didn't think we were gonna do anything so I'm still home ( Will you not be in town tomorrow You know, we could go to colossal cave or something No clue. Might be in town sometime after am Ok. Tell me if you are it would be really great to meet up Alright Colossal is expensive btw so not a good idea Ok. Hmm  Well, if you get into town tomorrow be sure to tell me Sometime I would like to see vail but if there isn't anything to do there There isn't anything to do Unless you're old No natural things? It's all desert and bushes I like those things But ok Are you ok I wouldn't want you wasting gas. It's  min south of Martha's. Yup, why do you ask Anyway you're probably asleep Goodnight  Goodnight Though I'm not And won't be for a bit Sorry I spaced You usually are at this time I know What movies did you see today Little Town of Bethlehem, The Interview, and Beverly Hills Cop How was interview Should I see it Anyway I just really don't feel like talking, I feel nauseous. I'm sorry. It's alright. Turns out it doesn't trivialize what I said as much. In fact the movie revolves around that towards the end Anyway goodnight Goodnight What is your problem Are you okay???? Yes??  I think we are both ok I feel terrible Like I'm getting sick. Anyway whatever I'm sorry ( both of us I feel like such an asshole towards you I was just upset today Don't worry about it though Well I'm not too sick, but I have coughed a few times Why were you upset I'm not that sick either but it felt like my appendix was gonna explode earlier. Afraid I'm allergic to some food No, it's dumb What did you eat on your trip No say it, we can clear it up First, look at my card   ()/attachment.PNG Also it was just lots of things, not really do do w you. So it really doesn't matter  Hahaha Are you really sure? I won't judge But not pushing Fuck you You know what it is I don't even feel like saying Because you're not an idiot Ok, I thought so Let me say this She lives  minutes away from me and is here for a total of  week I'm not gonna be a dick I have wanted to see you all the time this break but it's a lot harder because you are actually busy plus I can't just come over there for a sec cos it's  min away I'm sorry.  And I feel like this goes without saying but obviously nothing is going on there. At all Anyway, she's leaving in the next  days so it doesn't matter But I like you a lot more than her, of course I care about you You make me feel great about myself I really don't want this to be an issue between us... It's not! I just won a game of Evil Apples so I wasn't replying.  And I understand so that's why I felt like it shouldn't matter and I feel like I should just get over it.  But I mean obviously it gets to you I'm sorry though. Don't be sorry. I wish I could make you more secure about me and other people.  Congrats, is that your first win 
Well I think it's more of the fact that you used to do things with her, you know? Like if I started hanging with Shawn sporadically throughout the week I would expect you to be concerned or upset. I feel like that's natural, so I just didn't want to bring anything up but you kept insisting. Hahah no, it actually tells you how many you win if you tap the little profiles. I have won..... 
 games Goddamn Did you spend $ Well you see (don't laugh) Oh god I've lost  ( Hahah no money, but I've only won that many because I've played so many games I do spend the coins I win though. I bought a deck today. Anyway Aimee I'm really sorry about getting upset. And I shouldn't have lied to you like that. Oh that's not even that bad No it's really fine and natural, yeah but hopefully we can be open about things I want enough coins to buy one but I am pretty short Only like  now Well Nathaniel is really sweet And he does these games where we tell each other our cards That way we each take turns getting coins Can we do that lol Of course! You were just out of town when we did those haha You cheater Wanna start one? Actually believe it or not They're all asleep! We could invite a random person? We finished our game like  minutes ago, so KZ and I have been chatting. Oh Or we can invite KZ Lol that would be being jerks to him How so? If we take turns it's fine, right? Oh, yeah ok. Or how about Like we play a game for real until someone has  points Then we help out the others Alright! Right now? Ya You're not feeling tired? Nuer Niet Nuer Are you Not really. I've been up until at least  every night for the past couple of days Great Hahah yay for sleep deprivation  Are you making a game Oh I thought you were haha. How do I add random people? Just add me and KZ? Aww he just said he has to go to the library tomorrow So he needs to sleep You should watch the interview though, it's really not that bad Just to watch it I can send you the link over email or fun chat *FB chat lol Ok Well I'm gonna rent it legally A bit pretentious aren't you A tad Nah I just want to support Them Oh, thanks for clarifying. I thought you meant the movement to assassinate Kim Jong Un. That  Honestly, pretty shitty asshole I read this brilliant post In the movie he's actually really sweet About how he does brilliant PR to make the west world consider him a joke instead of the genocidal prick he is So we make jokes And don't overthrow him and liberate NK I thought he refused to do any PR??? As in His ridiculous threats And persona And ridiculous things he says he accomplishes Ohhhhh yes. The movie does a good job about pointing all of that out. Like literally what you just said That post is the movie And they mention his threats and the concentration camps and everything I will be sure to see it You know, they are showing all these cool French films at the loft next month Would be great to see Oh!!! Did I miss Gone with the Wind? ( Also, terminator  is on the nd and third Think so Breakfast at Tiffany's is showing in  WE MUST GO OMG Sergio Casablanca on valentine's day at loft ))))))))) Oh I must watch the first one again then. It's been so long since I've seen any Terminator movie. ) that is a must. We have to go see it. Ok we will have to go early Especially since I've never seen it! Damn it I missed Rosewater What is tidewater Rose* Omg we should see the Oscar nominated short films on Feb  It's a documentary about an Iranian journalist who was imprisoned You should listen to Ba'dem Alby by Amr Diab on his album Romantic Hits. Ok sure! Oh Ok I will In the morning actually cos I'm going to sleep Goodnight for realsies Okay! Hahahah Goodnight ❤️❤️❤️ Having Habibi Having a Habibi the Musical! Jk that was dumb   ()/attachment.GIF Lol I hated that show Max was a dumbass and ruby was bitchy AF And condescending Hahaha. Was she his mom or older sister? I had such a strange dream Basically I was at the loft with this other family from my church watching bob the builder And the mom of one of the kids sat next to me and I started scratching her head and I said don't worry, this is what I do to my mom Then my mom came Just really strange Wbu? Older sister That is strange... I got an unnecessary and out of place lecture from family friend about why I'm a dick, so that was nice And I played backgammon Where are you In real life or in a dream?? I'm still home but I think I'll be in town today. What did you want to do Real life Board games at park? Well what did you do to deserve that lecture? How were you being a dick? Sure, we need some tho Well, I stay in my room a lot and don't really talk to them and she is very involved with her kids, so she thinks it makes me a dick, because she only hears my mom's side of things ever Truuuuu I kinda knew that's what it was about. What does your mom say about you? Did you look for some? I think she is hurt. But there are some things that I can never forgive people for and her treatment of me when I came out is one of them, so I don't really care.  Ok I have this cool penguin game And taki (Hebrew card game) Mastermind Manuals Mancala ( but you don't think she is trying to make an effort by taking you to your appointments in LA? Or encouraging you to come out and talk to family and friends because she wants your company? Is taki two player? Also what's manuals? Aimee you have to understand that it's difficult for parents to know what's going on when their children come out As hard as it is for you, it's also as hard for them  And you also must take into account where they grew up 
I don't care if she makes an effort, it's too late. I know there are many factors into why she acted the way she did but it does not change how miserable she made me. I've heard this a million times, Sergio, it doesn't change the fact that I will never, ever forgive her. Not that this is on the same scale at all, but if hitler honestly believed what he was doing was right, it would not change my judgment of him an inch What exactly did she do to make you feel terrible? How did your dad react and did your parents ever argue? If you don't want to answer that's fine I don't Anyway lets meet up around ? Is that too late I don't think it's too late Might even be too early actually And taki and the others are all  player Which ones are you going to bring? And if it gets late we can play at library or seven cups or bookmans. Idk. Probably all  Sounds good Tell me when you are ready Btw I look really bad bc I need a haircut so don't judge  Did you find Michael Jackson attractive after plastic surgery? Also don't forget you have my bag and charger I did not find him hot Only before Ok I will not forgot! Forget Currently at movie w Reza so I will ttyl ) Oh ok cool Ttyl Hi Hey what'd you see Theory of Everything Oh cool how was that? Pretty great, inspiring I guess Well that's good. How's Reza Are we still gonna play He's good but his facial hair is like pubes Ya, I will bring all we need Oh ok well I've been in town for a while Like its thick and all over the place? No... I'll describe later Ok I'll be over at probably  Ok cool Wait shit what bag It's a Downton Abbey World Market bag  Fuck I will bring it back to you next time I'm sorry ( Also I will be there at  actually Don't worry about it Ok Here I'm with my family friend and she is caring for this disabled girl. She is  but looks . She can't talk, she just grunts, and puts her arms up as if to cower. It's so sad ( Do you know what she has or what happened to her?  That is really sad. Probably can't go to college or get a well paying job. Just think about parents who are expecting an independent child but now have this lifelong responsibility. You know I don't care about getting myself sick just to kiss you. I would do it regardless. It's congenital. No, she's like mentally not there at all. I doubt she ever went to school I know it's so sad I feel bad, I don't want you to have this Alex had a very high chance of being born with spina bifida... Or with some other congenital defect. Mom was in the hospital for about  weeks or something. During MUN you were really sick and I didn't get it. Although I remember you saying, what if I coughed on your dick She was abused and they left her in a cage outside for years ( To sleep- not all day It's great he turned out fine That is so inhumane and disgusting. Who does that?! This was her parents, correct? Maybe foster parents not sure But now she's living with the family friend? How did the friend find her? It's temporary. She has a permanent (ish) family, by they But they are out of town right now Who exactly is this family friend? What does she do and how do you guys know her? Why do you visit her alone without your parents? So She was my childhood babysitter, she basically raised me I visit her alone when I'm in the area because she is far out   Awwww that is so sweet of you to do. She's totally accepting and everything? Anyway I'm falling asleep So tired idk why Goodnight, shall I see you tomorrow before the party? Or will I get a ride? Yeah, I'll drive you! Sorry I am driving Goodnight Alright, I'm free all day so we can meet up earlier or whatever you want. See you tomorrow! ) Weird weird dream that we were on this highway with guns trying to shoot other cars Yet the biggest problem was that on our way back home We switched phones on accident for a whole day So I became smarter since yours had a bunch of news apps and you stayed the same What Lol This reflects your mindset, perhaps, but I'm sure your phone, by now, has more intelligent apps Haha So I forgot that I am at bridge til , and then might have some early evening engagements. I'll keep you posted I'm supposed to go to a NYE thing at Veris's real house Idk what times it is, he is supposed to be there, I should probably contact him What's up Oh alright, that sounds good! Did you ever know how to play Mao? The one where they were silent and refused to tell you the rules? Yes, my mindset. You know all I really want to do is drive a huge hippie van on I- and start shooting passing cars. A real turn on. Also we have to do the New Years kiss! And I have a present for you I am babysitting until ? So my brother is watching Wreck It Ralph and I'm trying to read Dorian Gray haha. Going to eat soon though. Wbu? NYT Doubles Down On Chastising NYPD  Veris used to play that game with me. I got very frustrated. Really? We can go shooting together ) Yes!! I'm watching fatal attraction Aww if Nate can't go to Veris' party, then Diviya is going to go to dinner with him instead and sacrifice party time. That is really sweet. YES THAT GAME WAS SO ANNOYING I wanted to stab everyone playing it. Have you ever shot a gun? You've been watching that since last week? You like it so far? Modern premature drinking age love That is really sweet I haven't, have you? Didn't have decent Internet while we were gone so yeah I do like it but the build up is worrying Yes, so many guns ever since I was  or . I grew up with guns in the house so I had to learn. I'm much better with a bow though. How did you watch Breakfast at Tiffany's? Then be prepared for literally the last half hour or forty five minutes, that's basically all it is. Does your mom keep guns I downloaded it ;(( Activist To Launch Balloons Carrying 'The Interview' Into North Korea  As if they have DVD players She does not keep guns, unfortunately. So I haven't lived in a home with a gun for a few years now. Exactly!!!! Such a waste of money They're just asking for trouble. It is literally one of the dumbest ideas. Oh, you bad boy. It's on Netflix you know. You could be wasting your computer's space with other movies haha I know, I just didn't have Internet right so I couldn't stream there, and I knew I wouldn't be able to stream I am pro gun too But you could have downloaded a movie on your list that's not on Netflix and watched Tiffany's when you get back, no? Oh ok I figured you were. The girls get really upset with me for being pro gun. But I don't think they understand that a police call won't solve all their problems I feel like you have some perspective here from living in an area that isn't upper middle class and predominantly white when you were younger. Some areas are dangerous as hell! I could have but I didn't realize it was on Netflix. I tried to pick a film that wasn't on it. Oh well 
Actually, it was predominantly Hispanic and around / white. But I encountered a lot when I was younger. Like I was home alone with my brother and a babysitter when I was , and this man pulls up to our house and asks for a cup of water. Being only , I let him in and he looked around. Then the next day he returned with friends and tried breaking in. They started banging on windows really hard and ringing the doorbell over and over again It was the scariest thing ever. And I had to call the police because our babysitter couldn't speak English. I had to hide my brother in the closet and then go help my babysitter And how long did it take officers to respond?!!! Hmmm They showed up after my parents had returned home from work There is no fucking way I will live without a gun Many of our neighbors had their homes broken into though. Lots of nearby shootings.  Our neighbors were drug dealers That's what I'm saying, you are the only one of them who lived in a shit area That's really scary Where was this, again? Oh, I read your text as living in an area that isn't upper middle class, but predominantly white So I was really confused  East Golf Links, like by Davis Monthan Air Force base  The place where many cars have been stolen and then left on fire Oh, I didn't even know that was a bad area! Wait, near Santa Rita high school?? Oh no, it's west Golf Links, sorry. East of Pantano the neighborhoods get better.  I had this friend from elementary whose father owned the Donut Wheel down the street lol She was Asian   ()/attachment.PNG Arabs defending themselves Wait what major cross streets? I have no idea where this is.. Potatoes gonna Potatoe Basically from Golf Links and Swan to Golf Links and Prudence Potate. Like po-tate. She made some comment about Nubians and called them monkeys Then said they probably wouldn't understand her music Oh no, Algerians wouldn't understand the music I finished Fatal Attraction Glad at the ending Ohpotate Oh potate I do not understand What this Arab drama is. Care to explain What are Nubians Aka why we need to be pro gun ^ end of fatal attraction. Obsessed is the same thing but with Beyoncé. Nubians I believe live in south Egypt? Oh she was condemning Algeria because of their actions during the  World Cup. And she probably commented on Nubians because they're black. There was no World Cup in ? What action Oh it was the South Africa Fifa confederations cup Your pic you sent doesn't seem to have any relation to caption I am confused It says I am love That was her pic but she put the caption  Like that is all her, I just thought it was funny During the qualifying matches for the  World Cup there were disputes between Egypt and Algeria  What should I see next What should you see next Next I am seeing The Gatekeepers and The Usual Suspects. You should watch Hotel Rwanda. That is actually on my list Not on the actual one but mental list Well it's leaving Netflix today so you should watch it Where did you find The Gatekeepers? Barnes n Novak Noble Ok, if I have time The advertisements for all the movies before gatekeepers all look really good Oh what's up? Are they in English I'm playing bridge with Diviya and Zellmer and Joseph Until  They are all in English, but the actual movie itself is in Hebrew. There is this animated movie it showed called Waltz with Bashir about the  invasion of Lebanon. Looks amazing. Oh well have fun! ) Can I pick you up at  Of course Also I couldn't do formal bc I didn't pack for it Ok then I won't either Might be a bit later That's fine. Thanks for letting me know. Actually, I'm gonna be a lot late. I gotta jump by home. Sorry ( Hahah that's all right. Just let me know when. Just left my house Here   And I love you too Yay we're going home tonight so I can watch a movie Yay! When Also what was the context of that love you text? Well my mom wants to see a movie tonight.... But I don't want to. We'll probably be home around  or , and if you're still up we can do the Skype movie tonight or tomorrow. And I love you too Ok. Alright, I might be up. Text me for sure Wow. Xóchitl sent me a really really long reply, basically repeating all the you're amazing and smart kind of stuff. Yeah, why did I send that at ? Ok cool < I had no idea to be honest I was very confused How long? That's really sweet of her 
Hey Sergio. I'm so glad you are feeling well. Don't apologize to me though. I'll take the thank you but not the sorry. 😊 Seriously. You have reason to feel sorry. Being there with you to talk to you and support you--that is the only place I wanted to be and the only thing I wanted to be doing at that moment at the party. It was my choice not an obligation of any kind. I wanted to make sure you felt safe and cared for because you are such an amazing, brave and wonderful human being. You deserve all the happiness and ease in the universe and it makes me sad that anyone would hurt you in any capacity. Your sweetness, honesty and vulnerability are inspiring. I respect you wholeheartedly. If you ever need a shoulder to cry on or someone to listen to you, I will always be there if you want to reach out. Have a fucking awesome evening 😊  I was very confused as well haha. I don't think it was safe to have my phone at that time. Wow. Yes in the future you should probably not have that on hand Trivia Crack? I feel like she's just saying it to say it. She obviously did not come with the intention to watch over me. Also I don't think you're seeing somebody in their prime while drunk.  Did Veris get back to you on our shot glasses? Do you have any other games that I should play? I agree with you, but I think the intention was there. And yes, he did. It's all good. What kind of game Yes I also agree. Although you guys say she's a little bitchy, I couldn't really find what made you guys think that. Any game you think I would like! Preferably something intellectual I like bridge But it is very hard to learn I thought you said steep learning curve? When did you learn to play? Yeah. Joseph taught me sometime over the summer Are you kidding me How will a Skype movie work? Do we both watch on foreign Netflix and Skype? Yes That's the idea at least Does your family have any New Years traditions Do you guys watch fireworks No, we usually do that on the th They bought champagne but didn't stay up to open it lol Do you Does th go crazy on New Years haha? Also I wonder if anybody we know saw the taco drop Sounds like a big step for your mom who doesn't drink haha We go to the TEP firework show at the park with my uncle and then out to dinner. It's nothing special. Then we go home and text each other happy New Years Oh, the th of  Lol was it a real taco No no, I think TEP is also responsible for NYE fireworks? Idk there's this park on the south side that does fireworks early.  Absolutely! Jk, no. Hotel congress hired some artist to make it, and it looked really cool.   ()/attachment.JPG I meant we watch fireworks on the th of  but have no NYE traditions. Though it is cool they do that That's a legit taco Oh sorry, I had thought you said that you go to th ave to watch fireworks. Btw I'm home Great. And I just finished kill bill You didn't like it, did you? I think I liked it somewhat? It was cool, but not my type of film Shit is rough for me this round of trivia crack I was so scared during that challenge. I only won by one. It was so hard! Well then I don't recommend Vol. ... Vol  is really bad Well, I feel like I have to finish it at some point. If only for the story In the beginning I kept getting extremely easy questions. For one of the art questions it asked how do you say tree in Spanish. Well you can watch it but it's very strange. Like she goes to this temple to meet an old Asian Kung fu master.  Apparently linoleum is not an official surface to play tennis on, according to Trivia Crack. Fuck sports. Lol Eh, this one was all kung fu filled too My phone died in the middle of a q Wtf At %.. Hahah so what happened? Did you have to redo? Landed on crown and answered the capital of Ukraine, yessssss Congrats!! It said I ran out of time That's so lame! I'm sorry ( I was going to challenge you so I would lose one but I wanted at least one win At least I considered   ()/attachment.PNG She looks super high Lol don't try to lose!!! I want a fierce competition She does... Did you take that pic? She looks awful! Yes ( it's on my snapchat story. What are you doing now I was just waiting on the Internet until you were ready to skype I'm ready Idk if we will get through it all, I'm pretty tired I kept thinking about how funny it would be if you fell asleep  Haha Donde estas  Callin you on Skype   You can watch it on Vimeo for free lol The interview? No, cabaret. Did you like it  Honest  I really do! It's such a masterpiece And Sally is so exuberant I love her Took a while to get into though It sad how it becomes clearer how deeply upset she is and how she covers it by the façade of an exciting and interesting life Well I'm only  min in, so I'm at the first real kiss between her and the roommate English teacher. But it looks like she has a drinking problem Oh... I thought you had finished OMG him Fucken love him No, I went to sleep before  for once
 too! Can you explain why the end of the Weimar is creating so many problems? Basically it's the end of Hitler's rule? Nope-- opposite. Hitler is on the rise Though not yet the sole head of the government  Oh right right, yes. How does this effect the Kit Kat Klub? The KKK *affect You mean the Cabaret? (Forgot what that is) Yes, the cabaret. Well, the moral values dictated by Nazism differ greatly from those of the Cabaret. But it's mostly not about how it affects the cabaret itself but instead the people Sally comes to know. You will see Do you know much about the religious aspects of Nazism? I mean I know that they condemned Judaism. Also if that is so, then why does a Nazi go inside the club and then get kicked out? Well, they were somewhat affiliated with the Catholic Church (as was Mussolini), which continues to be a large criticism of the Catholic Church They do not like Nazis. But as the Nazi power increases, they cannot continue doing that But why would a Nazi even enter the cabaret in the first place if the two had opposing moral values? I do not know Oh ok. What's up? What are you gonna do today I'm watching the terminal And my plan is to watch the terminal And maybe work maybe not Wbu I guess I lied Because I am sick ( I feel awful and tired. But my mom is making me do all these things today and tomorrow since she signed me up to staff at Boy Scout camp this summer... I really need to work though. I don't have time for things like that. And I told her I didn't want to staff and she said give up scouts or give up your phone  What's the terminal? My head really hurts ( What are you doing?  Wait doing you mean and? You could give up scouts and keep your phone? Bb I told you not to kiss me ( The terminal is about a guy who falls through a legal loophole and must reside in an airport I'm in bed but can't fall asleep. But I need to be preparing for some camp staff meeting tomorrow.  Basically she says I can quit scouts if I give her my phone. It's really dumb. I know ( haha but it's fine Reside in an airport? Hahaha hopefully it's one of those fun airports with a host of shops and entertainment That is really dumb. Why aren't you rushing to finish eagle? And build that bench or whatever. Then you will be done, no? No it's not fun-- his country was caught in a civil war and dissolved so his passport is not valid and he has no money or anything, and they are trying to get him to voluntarily leave so they can arrest him Well regardless of whether or not I have my eagle, she thinks it's important to keep active in the troop and with activities. But I also want to get that started soon Oh... Yeah that does not sound fun at all haha. How did you find this movie? I really don't think I can go to the movie thing tomorrow at Martha's damn 😭 Why does she care if your do BS? Well, I read a wiki article about a true story that happened to a guy, he stayed ok a French airport for  years. It said this film was based on that, so I was intrigued Why not She says I need to keep my mind active and stay busy, as if I wasn't active or busy enough with school.  That does sound intriguing, I just read the wiki article about him and the movie. I'll add it to my watch list. What role does Catherine Zeta-Jones play in the movie? Well this Boy Scout meeting is at  am apparently, so unless it ends early I will miss the movie marathon. I could come at  or  if all works out? What time are you going? And I don't mean miss the whole movie marathon, but I mean one or two movies. What time does it start She is the love interest? She is a flight attendant who meets him It's not too great a movie but it's cute and all The movie sure grossed a lot of money but didn't do so well with the critics. It just seems like such an odd movie for Steven Spielberg to direct since he usually does science fiction and history and action films. Well it starts at  but I think they're going to watch  Years a Slave first, so if I come late it should be fine Also where do you download your movies from? Oh, I don't want to watch that again.  Yes it is strange. It's like a small story, ya know? Like a cute little movie that would normally be indie but then tom hanks and Spielberg and John Williams came in ( years a slave that is, I already saw it) Mm I used to use pirate bay but that is no longer an option Kickass.so is what I used once but I don't like it much.  Also this app called Miro for playing the movies once downloaded is gr I don't want to watch it again either, way too long. So maybe if my meeting finishes at  or earlier, we can meet up and go to Martha's? I'll have my mom give me money to pay for your gas on the way.  I also used to use pirate bay. But I guess I'll use kickass.so? I really want to watch Cabaret and other movies while I'm at grandpa's. Oh so maybe Reyna would like that movie haha. Ok, it really shouldn't be much. Yeah you should do it.  Lol why would she like it Finally Alex's dad is coming here to grandpa's to pick him up. It's been so long and I'm the one who has been watching him for the past week. Well when I asked for the websites I was already on my way to grandpa's, so I didn't have time ( Because she's really into those indie romance movies. Did you eat anything interesting today How have you managed to watch anything?? Yes- pea soup. You? I usually put on a movie for him or make him food and then watch my movies. Also after we play with toys, I let him play for a while and I watch movies. But after a while it gets really annoying to watch a  year old for hours and hours a day. Never had pea soup, is it good? These Dijon mustard beef hotdogs... It's really unfair to you. Yes it's good, especially on a cold day. Those hotdogs sound gross? I agree, but I can't complain or my mom would get upset. Anyway, I'm just relieved that he's gone now. They're really bad... I had to put a bunch of ketchup to subdue the sour Dijon mustard chunks. So I'm getting some work done now, but later would you want to meet up to watch Moonrise? I can meet you wherever if you don't want to drive all the way out Chunks! Wait where would I be picking you up from? I thought your BS mwetingg? eting Oh for today you mean I'm still pretty beat up from  nye, but text me when you are done, ok Yes, chunks! ( it was awful. Alright I'll let you know when I'm done Maybe you can take a nap Right now I'm watching rain man. Have you seen it I have not, what is it about? And why did you decide to watch it? It's about a guy and his severely autistic brother. I don't really know why. I hear it referenced a lot and it won best picture.  “Ninety percent of Westerners have sexual problems. They are not aroused and most of them have relations with animals.” “in Western societies  percent of children do not know their fathers and are raised by their mothers. “Thirty-five percent of babies who are born in America are bastards,”  “The growth of feminism in the West and the fact that  percent of Western women prefer to sleep with dogs rather than men is the result of the absence of hejab and the diminished threshold of women’s sexual arousal,” Also I'm done haha Sounds like Gilbert Grape! The % figure seems somewhat possible Not the rest tho Maybe! He speaks though. He is brilliant! A savant Sad to say, but I also thought the % statistic was possible. I just think those misconceptions are very ignorant, especially since they are being publicized by educated officials. Oh yeah, the younger brother in Gilbert Grape still acts like a child ( More like a toddler actually On the image they have on Netflix he (Leo DiCaprio?) looks like a kid too Yes, his character is only , but he doesn't cut his hair short and he is always dirty from playing outside. Is that a good movie? I don't want to see it soon after this one, but eventually worth seeing? It's a good movie if you're into those heartwarming family/love summer vacation stories. I think DiCaprio was a phenomenal actor though Isn't he always! He's the fucking best Why can't he win his Oscar yet ( How are you feeling? I do not know He deserves so hard I'm alright, how are you  Honestly I'm tired, but not sleepy, but I don't want to go get dressed etc. plus I need to do laundry tonight. ( But I will pick you up tomorrow morning? We can call, and if we would get there before the end of  years, we can do something in the mean time Send me the recording about your mom? 
  attachment.ma lol I'm fine, just took a shower and I'm reading for apush. I am a bit congested but my head doesn't hurt anymore. That's okay! Don't worry about it. Of course. I can send the address of the place I'll be at or if I'll be at grandpa's. But I will call you. Friends challenges are fun! Yes! I'm making another At first I thought it was going to be a team thing Ok great.  About the assess Address Did you finish seminar No, I have a couple more pages to do. But I'm going to finish tomorrow and Sunday. I don't have much to do. Diviya worries too much about that Yeah I'm gonna start mine tomorrow night. It will be ok What do you have to write? History paper? That one was hard Still?!! That one was really hard Yes.. Only  per trimester Do you just choose friends instead of random? What was first trimester's about? Yep! Reagan and AIDS Fuck! I messed it up and did a character game instead. I'm sorry. And this trimester? Why is AIDS so important to you of all things? Did someone you know die of AIDS? This trimester I did grade inflation at universities.  
I do not know anyone who died of AIDS. Honestly I did the paper on it because I didn't need to do any research on it cos I already knew. But in general I don't know why. It's just an intersection of everything that's interesting to me- the 's, Reagan, history, gay history, medicine, politics It's just something I'm really passionate about.  Were you arguing for or against grade inflation? Or was the essay just about how history impacted grade inflation? 
As I've been doing my paper for Connolly's I come across a lot of the topics mentioned and I have found it interesting to me as well. But for some reason I am just fascinated with the Middle East, I guess in the way you are with AIDS and Reagan, and for no apparent reason. Also just announced Diviya can't go tomorrow then didn't reply. This new challenge was fun. Who else is going? I don't know yet. But in general it is going to be against grade inflation as an issue I need more lives to play, so it'll be  minutes bb ( So far it's you, Reyna, Nathaniel, Martha, and me. Maybe Diviya if we ever hear from her. Fuck!! It expires in  min Nvm 
 hours  Lol that's  hours Im dumb  ) How many coins you got So the essays for history can basically be on whatever the fuck you want? ! How are you going to incorporate history into grade inflation??? Yeah, doesn't need to be historical. It's history of science. And social science counts. Basically anything goes Oh How many do you have? Martha is getting really pissy Why is she pissy and in what format are y'all chatting Since Diviya can't go, she is considering cancelling We have this group text Why doesn't Diviya get her shit together and say yes for our sake I have seen over  films since the graduate. Wow The Graduate is the first movie on my watch list! So every movie after that --minus movies that I've seen before I started using the watchlist -- I've seen since. Second movie is Omar. So long ago... Good memories. I only have so little coins because I used a bunch during games hahah. Idk she's being weird. I think it's something to do with either her relationship or Martha's newfound morality. I do not understand their relationship Lol you been killin it I have had ridiculously hard questions too tho I'm watching Midnight Cowboy Dustin Hoffman < Is it overreacting to think Diviya might be mad at me? I snapchatted her and she opened it and never responded, and I texted her last night and she also didn't respond, and now she's saying she can't come tomorrow (  Awwww Martha To be quite frank with you I don't either. He is like a little lamb and obsessed with sports and slightly homophobic. I don't not only understand the appeal but the dynamic. What do they even talk about?! He doesn't care about the news. Idk. Just very strange to me. Oh... I meant Martha and Diviya I like Nate Lol you're just going through all those Dustin Hoffman movies, huh? What's next? Tootsie. I like him too, but I'm allowed to question things. Nah, it's just also on my list. Mmhm damage control Hahah I swear. Though I do want to see tootsie.. Might add that to list . It still needs a lot And I'm only  movies away from starting it so it needs to grow Can I give you some movies I really want to see? Sure. Though I will use my discretion this time lol so I don't watch bachelorette again ) Hahahah I'll recommend to you critically acclaimed movies this time that are on my list Or really interesting films Just a second OMG JESSICA LANGE IS IN TOOTSIE I NEED TO SEE IT Who Prefer interesting over acclaimed She was in King Kong, Big Fish, and American Horror Story Here's my list for you  - Carmen Jones () - Mommy () - Amira and Sam () also middle eastern so idk - Ida () - Inside Job () documentary,  - Waltz with Bashir () - Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome ( and preferably when you're high) Diviya and I thought the last one was especially aesthetically pleasing  Also you should probably watch Valley of the Dolls Ok I will check them out What's Midnight Cowboy about? Any of those you recommend most?  Midnight cowboy is about a male prostitute and his friend. It won best picture too. Not sure what the plot is yet Well Ida, Mommy, and Waltz with Bashir look promising.  Gary cooper mmmm   ()/attachment.jpg I was going to send some text about my phone call with Martha just now, but I think it's so funny how an opened snapchat with no response is so problematic.   ()/attachment.jpg Anyway, Martha is just really sad.   ()/attachment.jpg Why is she so sad He is gorgeous oh my I think it's nothing Look at that cowlick in the first pic I think I should focus more on older movies and actors.  I just think that many older movies (before ) are too ordinary in content Like sitcoms ya know Pretty much because Diviya opened her snapchat and didn't reply, didn't reply to her text, and told us she couldn't come but didn't give any reason. Hellcats hahah. It really did feel like a sitcom, partly due to the length. Or maybe div is really working seriously now? I mean that is a good explanation I think What movie were you watching with Gary Cooper? Yeah, Diviya told me she's been working all day. Martha was being silly. None. They referenced him in Midnight Cowboy. Did you reassure her 
Holy shit so orientation tomorrow is apparently from am-pm, but my mom told me not to worry bc they always end earlier, which is true. But either way, Martha moved it to  for Madeleine and Nathaniel, and they're still starting with  Years a Slave lol. Shit that's so late I know!!! We'll probably only get through two movies. I did reassure her and I had Diviya text the group. Maybe we can watch moonrise while they watch  years if we get there early Well maybe you can ditch and say you are busy. I bet it won't end before .. One time they said orientation from - and ended it at  lol. I walked in and they said I could go. Lol wtf I'll find a way to make it work haha. But I'm saying if it does end at , it wouldn't be a problem since they're still starting with  years. And if it does end at , we can watch moonrise kingdom in the other room while they watch  years Bc it's for extra credit It works out for us either way Alright, cool. I just don't want to start my social day at pm, but I understand What do you mean? Why is that? Now Nathaniel can't go This is why arranging this is stressful Well, it's just late in the day to start a movie thing ya know  Why can't he go We had planned it a week ago! But yeah I understand. Idk what I'll do if it doesn't end up happening. Reyna probably won't go. He doesn't have a ride. Does he live on the east side Yes he does Then it's on everyone's way Ok I let him know. How's Midnight Cowboy? Nathaniel said he would be able to go around  How did you get all  wtf Martha cancelled ( Midnight cowboy is fine but I'm not far in So we're going to watch movies on our own and discuss them over a group chat lol R u efucken kidden m It sounded really great to watch moonrise at her house Fuck You beat me by one second! Are you fucking kidding me   ()/attachment.PNG Omg ok so we might just turn it into a sleepover! Which is even better Heck yes I want that so much It would be the best thing ever. I'll update you < Ok Martha's concerns Ok obviously I won't bring anything if that is on the list Of concerns - not getting enough sleep - sleeping in the living rooms (which I don't think any of us mind) because her grandparents are home Lol it was on Madeleine's list - legit concern -don't care Would you want to host a movie night? I guess.... Not really  Bc it's closer to z mansion for the girls and Nate Oh Mm I guess I would prefer not, I don't have a large TV even Plus I don't want to watch  years Well the other movies on the list are The Color Purple and Schindler's List Maybe this is dumb but what about going to her during the day and then sleeping at mine? Most of them live near me anyway so it's not extra gas Fuck I've seen the latter too And I never want to see it again But it's ok I have my laptop Martha's is just far for everyone especially Reyna But that's alright, I think the plan is dying down. The whole chalupa? Well you were the last hope lol but don't worry Because they need to be at Z mansion at  And they'd have to get up super early from Martha's  *wake up from Martha's at  Oh ok That's not even that early but ok Lol now Martha says she doesn't even want a sleepover and likes her own bed. Ok well it's all good. Martha is all over the place do you just not to host at your house ever again? Maybe if there's a good reason, but not particularly I would do a movie night But not now Not on such notice What if it was just you me and Diviya   I would do it Or if it was us and her and Nate Or reyna Lol wtf I asked Diviya and she said why don't you just do date night ( Not that I don't want to do date night But if we are at my house I prefer to have more than just us so . Mom don't bother me bout it . We actually watch movies........ Diviya told me she'll come but she won't spend the night and I should She said it's better like that I actually want to watch movies too! I wasn't expecting to do anything if we went to Martha's or whatever They want to know what time (her and Nate) Wait he would come too? That's gr Yes N So do I say /? Well I suppose whenever you finish I was thinking way earlier to Or ? Yo Because if they leave at like  We can do  Is that ok Is  ok? Yeah I'll be done with my meeting by then Ok. Tell div I can pick her up? Does Nate have a ride I think Nate will but probably not Diviya  Also hahahah that's N. Ok Gr M Wasn't that hard It was so hard wtf all the football And that Tom Hanks movie and the dates that were too close to one another Oh man That was bad I have learned that its always either Peyton Manning or Tom Brady if those are options Exactly! And Lebron or Jordan for basketball.  There was that one emmit question lol and I got it right. I saw that one and I was dunno so I picked the whitest name You went so fast Did you not want to lose on time Actually I thought that you answered it first And that it went by turns ??? But it timed you on how long it takes to complete and how many you got right Yep Like I didn't know we could both do it at the same time You going to sleep now? M Yap I am / through MC And it is not very interesting!! So I will sleep Good nach I'm reading Dorian Gray and he sounds so lovely Good night habibi ❤️ Hasta mañana pasta I love how Wilde makes each moment so vivid and clear. The imagery is superb. Hi Yep he is great like that Especially flowers Yes!!!! Flowers and Lord Henry and gestures and expressions Lord Henry Fuck, everything that man says My mom asked if I'm dating anybody and I kept denying but now she knows Is ridiculous She's telling me you're going to dominate me and have sex with me And you have a strong personality I know haha he just goes on and on about everything Upi is up! That was awfully embarrassing. And alright I'll play soon! Yeah.. Is everything ok? I don't care to know the details of the conversation Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy is a lot like Reza Yeah she just said I can't sleep over ( but she's ok with us being together Haha so really annoying and vulgar? Strange, but present, moral character Are they actually Cowboys? Well, no. As the guy frequently says, Now, I ain't a real cowboy but I am a stud . Do you know why that's the name of the movie?  Midnight Cowboy is rated X, but I think now it would be PG-, or a light R. It is strange I was thinking it was a club he worked at or something and was a prostitute there No Maybes because he tries to use his cowboy shtick to get business, like at midnight? Not sure Oh so is it gay prostitution? What do they show that makes it X worthy? Do you see Dustin Hoffman with it all off?!! No, mostly straight And no. He is very sick. In fact it is implied he is a virgin They said it was for drugs and nudity? They smoked a blunt, and there was only frontal nudity of a woman Just boobs What's up at meeting Do we still have to watch  years, color purple and Schindler with them Can we pick other movies The meeting is awful and so boring I'm just sitting here listening to presentations I've heard many times before or presentations I've given in the past No! We can watch anything of historical significance  He's sick??? I won flarp though We can watch moonrise while they watch  years and then they can pick other historical movies She also recommended PBS movies Lol those aren't even movies Isn't the extra credit capped at ? Like you won't get bonus for watching  historical movies What is flare Flarp Nope! Capped at  movies I think, and  movies if you got a letter home How many have you guys seen   ()/attachment.JPG We haven't seen any. We were planning on watching them all today haha Shit Ok let me choose them at least I think Diviya's seen the Color Purple though? Or have some inpt Input Ok Yeah just choose some good historical movies Well we want to watch shorter movies Not feckin  hours Looking at you, Schindler Billings approved though And  Years like damn Of course All the President'sn The Great dictator? (Hitler farse, somewhat historical) I really want to watch birth of a nation and she would give you super bonus points but it is so long It alone caused the resurgence of the KKK Zero Dark ? Argo? Oh yes anything to do with civil rights or KKK or reconstruction or civil war she would love But that is, again, over  hours and from ! Well Zero Dark  is more recent I think movies about things that happened in the s- Lol Selma OMG THEY ARE REMAKING BENHUR I am so excited A mustard? Amistad... What is the strict guideline? Ok now Martha says it's back on and we can come over..... What Wtf Ok I'm good w that I can still pick up div And Nate if he lives somewhat on the way Tell them that? Lol alright then. So confusing gosh So idk if Nate is going or not Ok So Diviya said its ok if you pick her up around . Could you get me from grandpa's after? And she also wants to know if you could take her home Yep and yap And Nathaniel wants a ride too lol If he could be definitive that would be gr What is his address Hey what about Gone with the wind or Django For us to watch 
 south avenida planeta  OMG!!! Gone with the wind holy shit Django is too inappropriate Also what time are you coming for all of us? I feel really bad that you have to do so much driving ( I planned on picking you up at , Diviya  Nate whenever I get there I'm wearing baby underwear  ??? I think you can get Nathaniel first and it would be fine Didn't have clean underwear bc didn't pack Ok Haven't left div's yet... How does baby underwear fit you Is your brother just fat Jk lol is she taking too long Yes but I was late too I don't know! It was tight at first but it looks sooo good Ok then you can get me before Nate But if I was on time she would be  min late Ok Brother is so fat. I didn't think it would fit My balls are being squeezed right now Go commando Good idea actually  Remember do not allow anyone to talk down on you with degrading words & foul language - YOU deserve better & most respect  -mom ( You're a dick ) Can't make your mom a liar eh It's only bc she read our texts but I don't think she knows we joke around when we call each other bitch and stuff... GOD bless you Sunday  Hi Are you going to sleep soon Possibly. How are you I'm alright. It's really bad with my brothers though... Anyway it doesn't matter How are you feeling Aimee ok I want to talk to you As upset as I am with my mom all the time I don't know who I would have or what I would do without her And it really frightens me Because I only have my grandpa and he's not able to support me for much longer I'm just really sad 
I think you need to talk to her in the morning, and tell her that you need to know what's going on and then address these concerns. You deserve to know what's going on, and it's just going to drive you crazy not knowing I'm really sorry ( It's so fucking unreasonable for her not to tell me!!! I feel like I have such a huge responsibility because it's basically me taking care of her children while she pays the bills, dammit.  It's fine, thank you Like right now I'm putting my baby brother to sleep which I have done innumerable times this week And if something's going to happen I need to know, you're right Thank you so much for taking me to the hospital though. It didn't mean much to me until I was with her in the room. I'm really glad she encouraged you to go see her If only to drop things off Well, having to take care of them is mostly because of break, no? I mean not that much while there is school Well it's mainly on weekends (Fri-Sun) and on days she works midnight shift for DEA. Not during the weekend as much but it's still stressful. Because it's more than just putting him to sleep and cooking for him I think you need to talk to her about that And how it's unfair to you And how you need that time for yourself, because you do. You have enough stress from school Not now obviously That's all true, and especially stressful during the upcoming months and with AP season.  Anyway, thank you. I really appreciate all that you do for me. You mean so much to me Did you finish Westside Story )  No I'm like  min left What are you doing  Trying to put the wild child to sleep. Richie came in here earlier for a charger and started kicking me, causing Alex to cry. And I won a Trivia Crack round against Reyna! Took a day and a half haha Wbu? Finishing the movie? (. Richie is a dick How much did you win by Yep Oooooh good job winning that one I used like  coins - You can use coins on challenges????   ()/attachment.jpg Curvy ballerina Mmm That is curvy Not fat Curvy She has a really tight core and her thigh is all muscle She's not fat... Are you calling me out on my word choice No  It's just that Many people say curvy to mean fat, and you demonstrated what curvy is perfectly Oh yeah, that bothers me when people do that. Like Zoe.... She would say she wasn't fat but curvy I think there is a distinct difference between the two  African Americans tend to be curvy But ok Zoe wasn't really fat tho They do Well I don't think she was the most fit either Did you find her brother attractive or was it just me He was hot Sure but I think she was curvy? She had big hips and boobs and small waist Yeah I guess I just forgot about her waist Do you ever think about your previous relationships and does it ever sadden you Mm Not really. Friendships sure, relationships not really. I used to be embarrassed about some fuck ups but not now. You are? 
Not in a long time. At first I used to think about it all the time and compare this to those ones, but it felt inappropriate and wrong. Occasionally when you bring up Shawn's name I think about other things, like sexual activities or how you liked him, but not our relationship. I also used to think about fuck ups. I guess the only people I think about are Anna Maria and Audrey and Priscilla Why Audrey? Do you not want me to mention him   ()/attachment.jpg Look at this frozen solid frog! He froze while looking for a mate on a Norwegian lake. Her whole family situation makes me feel awful... So I'm nice to her and talk to her. And I think she's a nice person despite how ridiculous her stories were I don't mind hahah, but it's funny to think about how different he is now. What is wrong with her family Poor frog It would be scary if he is the same now as then, he was a dealer then, and is still emotional AF  Very low-income and there were sure signs of abuse... Like she had lots of bruises, then she would tell us and one person would say it wasn't true and then she would burst out crying. So you're saying he hasn't changed much or what? He seems worse now than before? Why did she move? I'm saying how do you know he has changed? He is so private, or rather changes his tune with his surroundings. It is hard to tell how he is. She moved so that her dad could find a better job and apparently that was in Wisconsin.  Well I guess I'm talking about the change from when we were together to after. After we broke up he wasn't on honor roll anymore and was a dealer. It's just interesting. Oh. Well I'm going to sleep, hope all is well, good night!! Goodnight love 💕 Yo What up I had such a weird dream about you. First we were watching movies and doing butt stuff Then all of a sudden a group was at my grandpa's house playing evil apples in one room and trivia crack in another And I almost killed you over it But I just woke up What's up with you You would kill me over trivia crack? Jk Well, I NEED to work on paper but really don't want to I think I should start at  or  but might set it to  I really don't wanna do it I had a dream that said I needed to get amazon prime Also mr Mathews smoked me out And I went camping w my dad (Separate dreams) I've been thinking so much about butt stuff since NYE it's ridiculous. You should start it after you've eaten and everything, so - sounds fine. As long as you're productive. Lol apparently Mathews actually does smoke pot, so that's funny Why have you been thinking about butt stuff? Your butt?  Yes I knew that lol Well after we decided not to bc it would be in a car, but I really really do. Honestly I want to do it when we're both prepared and in a bed and relaxed. I just want to feel safe and secure, if you understand? You think Mathews is gay/bi too? I think so Wait though whose but Butt No I don't think he is How is everything with your mom? Have you talked to her  Mine... But I want you to go slow and be careful and use lube. It's just really concerning for me. Ok! I have not talked to her. Grandpa tried calling but she didn't answer so she's probably asleep No Aimee but I really do want to feel comfortable with this idk how to stress that enough I understand that Sometimes I feel like inviting you to grandpa's when mom isn't home bc of all the spare rooms he has but idk Like he wouldn't check on me or anything but it's risky If you say your name's Emmett it would be ok I don't think that's a safe environment I mean if that's the goal Well then your house some time? Or where Yeah I thought you were really paranoid about your mom I mean I am What does your dad think about all of this Does he ever ask you about your relationships or anything Was he more accepting than mom He doesn't ask What are you doing now I guess that's good sometimes then Reading Dorian Gray, except I need to eat! Wbu? Writing? Omg that challenge I'm such an idiot. I wasn't even thinking damn I will start at  I ate a sandwich Upi is up Upi What happened on upi  Well my grandpa was walking over to ask what I wanted for breakfast lol so I tried to hurry and I wasn't paying attention  Nate and I had such a good game. We were up until  playing and it kept going back and forth with challenges No mas vidas ( I'm still in bed since I feel sick, so idk if I'm going to do homework because I might not go to school tomorrow Upi sandwich. What kind of sandwich Did you know that Walt Disney has never showed an animal being killed and never will show an animal being killed in any of his films because he accidentally killed an owl as a child Bambi? Only the shadow, but you never see the actual scene Did you beat Nate He only beat me bc he got that sports character. Damn straight boys. Anyway, good luck on your paper! Hopefully you are productive. Sorry I spaced. Thanks Hi I'm taking a break Now I have . pages But I don't know where to go from here Oh well Hi I'm watching The Phantom of the Opera,  version Despite the harsh reviews it received, I really like it... That's really good. It takes me about an hour to do one page lol. How many pages does it need to be? It got good imdb eating Well I already had almost  pages so it's not too fast It needs to be  So a lot more It also got nominated for some Oscars and won one I think Ohhhh ok. Is the rough draft due soon? The sets are really beautiful No. The final is due tomorrow.. I have it on DVD but haven't yet watched it. Might be a good addition I don't operate like Diviya and Martha at all. I guess it's not so obvious this year when I have so little work but I operate best when I'm under time pressure In fact I really can't get anything done if its not due in the near future If I had to watch  movies for APUSH I would pull an all nighter and start at PM Oh shit! I had no idea bc I thought it was due at the end of the nd trimester. So my mom is going to be in the hospital for a few more days... There's something wrong with her heart. It is a good addition! You should watch it sometime. Do they know what is wrong? Yeah I also procrastinate really hard too. I wait until the day before to do almost everything. And it's when I'm the most productive  That sounds like relatively good news? Heart issues at such a young age are usually very treatable, I'm lead to believe Well she might have to get heart stent surgery. That's not risky though! ) You don't know what the underlying condition is?  Sorry I'm being invasive. Feel free to not answer I don't mind if you're being invasive haha. Unfortunately though, I don't. She only tells my grandpa things and that was all he said. Listen to old man willow? That's what the end of midnight cowboy is. It's all trippy, the feel of the song Don't have to listen to all of it Or any of it actually But it's very long  Oh, I was going to listen right now! My brothers are just freaking out because mom called. Lol the band looks really hippyish  I really like it Do you ever hold your breath during movies when characters go underwater  Mm I don't really do that? What did she say I used to do that as a child. Almost passed out during Nemo Jk lol. But I really did do that Was gonna say You were dumb She wanted to talk to my brothers and then told me to get along with them and cooperate Hahahahah . pages. I'm really out of shit to say Maybe you should watch this lol and then continue writing http//m.youtube.com/watch?v=Aeiwcq-O Yep so that's a great way to get libertarians on the side of republicans /sarcasm Ok but she's legitimately unintelligent I have never smoked Pot before. Not all libertarians are stoners I've always just wanted to read one of her books to see what goes through her head. I saw her on The View talking about one of her books and racism and she is such an idiot oh my gosh. I also don't like Michele Bachmann on media. She just avoids all the questions and tries to give a picture perfect idea about republicans and how democrats are wrong with no compromise. I just thought that sentence was funny. But the girl in green echoed my belief She's a really dumb shit Michelle bachman I loved that comment about the hypothetical if we didn't live in a socialist society would it still matter? Yet she refused to answer  The republicans will not capture the hearts of the young until they stop giving the time of day to unintelligent people They're just really disjointed 
Also, I watched a TED talk today about how  years ago the average IQ was  because people didn't have use for abstract and logical thinking and didn't teach it or emphasize it and I wonder how much that is still relevant to the older generations now that supports the Republican Party and seems anti-logic at times! Ann coulter kinda looks like a drag queen And she's  foot And she's a total bitch Would not be surprised if she was trolling us all and was a drag queen 
Well obviously it's much more than just the anti-logic because of the households they were raised in, religion, etc. I just think that the GOP has some really good points and views on certain things but it's these dumb fucks who represent them with their über religious ideals attached to everything they believe that really repulsed people. That's really interesting though, I never knew that. You should send link Lol I wouldn't be surprised if Ann Coulter is trolling us about everything. 
See, religion is changing. It is less popular now because people are not willing to accept a lack of logic. There is nothing logical to say god does not exist, but to say that the world is  years old will not be accepted. Add that to the anti-progressive social values that religions seem keen to hold close to their core instead of focusing on belief.  Well, Mitt Romney was not a dumb fuck. I think it's the liberal media also that promotes the image of a few dumb republicans, but for some reason Fox gives them airtime. Also Sarah Palin was an incredibly dumb choice. I'll find the link Or rather attitudes towards religion* You can be religious and progressive but we make everything into a package deal now. Anti-war, pro-welfare, atheism and gay marriage don't need to go together https//www.ted.com/talks/james_flynn_why_our_iq_levels_are_higher_than_our_grandparents?language=en 
Yes, I agree. I thought that the allegations against Romney were absolute nonsense and had little to do with his views. Like what, he had a dog on the roof of his car or something during college? I don't really remember, but the party system is just polarizing us and media isn't helping.  We actually talked about the package thing in APUSH once and all agreed how upset we were that there isn't one candidate to represent all of our views and there never will be. And someone said we could abolish the party system and do a majority vote for every single matter lol. Well The fundamental issue Is that the average American is a dipshit And we can't change that P Majority vote, even if feasible, is dumb. Tyranny of the Majority. The Founding Fathers knew this- hence we have representatives.  Basically, people are fucking stupid. But also they don't have time to care about all the issues and be well-informed. And even well-informed people make (what we would consider) dumb decisions Humans are driven towards instant gratifications, not long term vision, which is necessary in politics Okay yes sorry I fell asleep ( Yeah and it's funny to see how educated the people we criticize the most are. Like Ann Coulter went to Cornell and law school. They're all pretty well-informed though. 😘😘😘 
I watched this Michele Bachmann video on Israel earlier and of course she is pro-Israel, but what I found strange is how she said that she needed Judaism and that she is grateful for the existence of her religion because of Judaism and how she grew up loving Jews. She even threw in a little Bible quote about Moses and the Sermon on the Mount Or perhaps she just mentioned it Lol I was just reading about Cornell. They wanted to curb grade inflation so they posted all the average grades of each course, but it made it way worse cos everyone took the classes with higher average grades Bitch all bible quotes are big Word of G-D! Oh shit. There goes an acceptance letter for medical school to an undeserving kid with a . because he took all the easy classes whereas the . who specialized won't get in. My dad made pasta and when he put it in the water bugs came out Capital H-I-M Hahah that's so gross. When I went on Boy Scout camp outs and bugs flew into the food that was cooking, the adults still made us eat it because it was protein, as if it was even a sufficient amount of protein. 
Well, I wrote this paper and as it turns out that's not really accurate. Princeton deflated their grades a lot (~% A's to a max of %), and nothing bad happened to the students. At top institutions everyone does fine because of the name, and at less rigorous places if you try it's quite easy. So really it's not a big deal. Plus % of their students took advantage of it so its not exactly a cheating few...  Protein more like let me enforce my dumb standards of masculinity on you Does that sound like a Tumblrina thing to say? I wonder if I sound like one now. At least I'm not as bad as div Omg I was just about to say Well, well Mr. Rajesh hahah But you beat me to it Lol I like that final touch, that her man will adopt her name. So feminist Amelia Earhart made her hub take her name and forced it to be an open marriage   She seemed upset that the extra credit was due next week instead of today. Seemed like a complete accident. Ok idk if my text messages sent or not They did but as the other number?     ()/attachment.JPG Found at a restroom at a large gas station/food place on the way     ()/attachment.JPG Why is pretty before woman? Must a woman be pretty? What about pretty boys hmm Why must women even be called women? Why can't we all just be humans with boobs or human with dicks? Why segregate the humans That's cissexist bitch Why can't we all just be humans And just keep that to ourselves unless we have consensual sex which may or may not consist of genitals or physical contact Didn't you hear? It consists of licking elbows and ears. We have no right to violate anybody's body other than those three places. Four Unless you're missing an ear Good call, that was almost ableist But I have no elbows My arms just jiggle ya know Cos I have a few extra pounds here and there, like  of my closest buddies.  #nofatshaming #bodypositive #health There was some new form of sex with the brain but we need to keep in mind people with Down's syndrome or Alzheimer's  I think the doc is not used to normal weight patients cos he commented that I was thin and thus an easy case like  times How do you say normal weight without implying fat is not normal? I am having sex with my brain right now I think and then electrical signals penetrate my neurons But it could be sex even if it didn't penetrate them Or even if the electricity was on a Skype call Or if it was another neuron! Same-cell marriage! My drunken note from the Veris party when I went crazy Alcohol compainsiomfhip championship We can type % well it's bam bans 
 I love me I love her I love love low epic e  Wowoowowowowo I love the world That's great! Did he talk about scarring or the aesthetic of it? Lol I was reading those as my grandpa was telling me that if my mom died my life would be different and I felt terrible for laughing Maybe I too should keep a collection of drunken notes I have drunken text messages if that counts Oh goodness, that fucking poem YOU told me to read it then. I was going to wait until midnight but you kept on insisting. YOU insisted on reading it drunk Lets not recap this event Send the drunk texts? Lol after I read it sooo..... Does this mean you're breaking up with me? Ok tbh that's what it sounded like but I was also high AFFFF He said I have great pecs which will help him out, and make it look better. He said he believes it will be a really good result.  Scarring is scarring though. If I woke up at  instead of  my life would be different I sent multiple I love you's to Zayna and Bella. I've texted Anthony that alcohol makes me want to pee. And on New Year's Eve I told Anna Maria that I love her and that I miss talking to her and that I will never forget her And that I'm a little drunk right now Did Anthony answe you Answer Yeah he did He told me to go pee lol Lol Did you Did he ask if you had been exercising? Nope I don't even think I had to go pee... I'm not sure. Oh and I send so many drunk snaps Tess's Yesss* OMG never gonna let go of the bong pic you sent to... Was it Tess? Drunk snaps are guiltless unless someone screenshots it Then the bong pic is also guiltless because Tess just replied ayyyy or niceeee or something stupid That was hilarious Mmn  It was kinda hilarious tho Shannon sat with us during lunch today and she was telling us how her and Armando had sex at a park Then a police officer shined his flashlight on the back window and started yelling at them to get out So she was trying to put her clothes back on but he kept yelling and yelling  That's horribly awkward So she just went out topless and then he said no!!! Get back in there and put clothes on Hahahahahja  It was the funniest thing I started crying from laughing I like the way Shannon tells stories Basically a Diviya but with a Shannon twist With a Shannon twist And Shannon was naked Shannon sounds like such a bitch name SHANNON SHANNO SHANN  SHAN SHA SH S SH SHA SHAN SHANN SHANNO  SHANNON That looks like a breast S SE SER SERG SERGI SERGIO SERGI SERG SER SE S SE SER SERG SERGI SERGIO SERGI SERG SER SE S So does this but flatter boobs Ezekiel or something Oh god I was legit a bit hurt But I think he was just really out  That your mom would tell? No That he was like well even if you did want to go by it I wouldn't use I just didn't think it was right for him to bring that up regardless I agree I remember saying wowww that's so offensive I was out too OMG and fucking jay But he was a trainwreck Did you blackout? How much did you even take I didn't see you take much at all When have you seen his dick??? Sorry man I did not blackout, never have. Although I remember taking many many shots on my own I'm gonna pull a Shawn on this one And Xóchitl started crying when I took one Lol no that only counts when describing what it looks like You don't remember humping the wall Therefore you have to tell In model in UN he changed in a very conspicuous place Like literally facing us all and didn't say anything It's ok tho You wanted to look though didn't you  Don't even deny it No Stop No I really didn't I'm not just a dick monster or perv god Perv, god Not pervgod I got the message without the comma but hey  I can't help it Literally I have my sex drive more under control than you by far I don't know why I'm the whore here You literally told me that you sat behind Jacob Gabbitas and he stood up and you were staring at his ass This was like a month ago That's different by a lot from looking at a guy's junk while he changed Ass is public property If I asked to have sex pretty much anywhere you would probably agree I only saw Jay's because I didn't know if he was wearing underwear or not Not true! Name  bizarre places and I'll give honest answers Desert Park at night in dark (not car) A clean bathroom to a nice and large business Graduation, like if we locked one of the changing rooms In my car in a quiet part of the school parking lot at lunch (where no one walks by) Those are so good! Also did you know that James Boehm and Danielle Macias had sex on the school stairs Shannon told me that today Under what circumstances Did they do that Well because they were allowed to stay the night for the senior prank Is that a yes to all  Lol nice Nope! Mmhm horn dog My only objection is public bathrooms But wow we need to do these No see I don't want to do these they were suggestions to show that you are a whore... You wouldn't do any of them huh Oh yeah knew it Except desert. Desert would be fun You're evil ) Graduation actually sounded fun I think I would do that one too actually That's a story ya know Please tell No I mean it would be a story Ohhhhhh yeah it would be For the grandkids Well we should have done it last year ugh Jk that was a bad time Didn't you send me on a gum run? I think so Lol going out with a BABG Bang.. No!!! With a BABG sounds better More intense   ()/attachment.PNG Lolllll Ok b I need to go to sleep / good convo I wish you the best of luck for tomorrow Good night and probably by the next time we really speak I will be  lbs lighter ❤️❤️❤️ Hahahahah good night ) How are you??? Ow But ok Though the apartment is very pretty Minimalist and very French, great view great porch not that I can see from bed lol Febrewery   ()/attachment.GIF DD How are you feeling though? Are you satisfied? How did you feel after What's the apartment called? I cannot see it for  days it is all gauzed to hell. It is so gauzed that it looks like I have big boobs when I wear a shirt I felt ok, just do not want to move It's not like an apartment complex, it's just a duplex, attached to another one in a neighborhood of large houses. I think it was a house that was converted into two apartments to rent out Lol if mom secretly got me a breast augmentation and knew I wouldn't read the paperwork This painkiller is very effective I have no pain now, as long as I do not move Sergio you are so supportive of me every day with everything that I do and I appreciate that so much.  Hi! Sorry, just finished our global meeting. We watched this strange Guatemalan short film called The Garden of Steven about a missionary who eventually gives up the cause for alcohol.  As I read the big boobs thing I was thinking about the augmentation hahah. And then you said that so you basically read my mind. ) At least you'll get to watch a bunch of movies and be lazy all day. Lucky you. My mom spoke to the surgeon and he seemed very satisfied with the result, so that's good.  Lol if I get the attention span Right now I'm in and out of sleep because I don't have energy Not cos I'm actually sleepy Do you recommend the short Film I was literally about to ask if you had been taking naps. How long are you staying in that duplex? No, there isn't really any cultural significance in the movie because the people act how you would expect any others to be if a missionary was trying to convert others. It's just super strange we will be here for a week! Oh, how did you guys choose it  Oh my goodness that sounds absolutely awful. A whole entire week in bed. Do you have physical therapy? Lol well I chose it during APUSH this morning without reading the synopsis. http//smudged-red-lips.tumblr.com/post/ Well I can move around, I can walk even now as much as I want. We can even go out, I just don't want to. They said I could drive tomorrow.. Oh it's on Netflix? Ew Though I will not drive! It is crazy here plus we took my dad's car Yeah, where would you even drive to? Maybe sightseeing haha.  But that's wonderful! ) I'm really really glad that everything turned out fine Super relieved There's actually this website dedicated to short films that we always use.  It has almost every country. So no, it is not on Netflix. Idk just to hang our, restaurants, shopping at uniqlo lol. Visit colleges, not that I can apply anymore Rate your day on a fruit scale. From your least favorite fruit to your favorite fruit. For me, it would be from like orange or cranberry to persimmon   ()/attachment.jpeg Making dinner ) It looks picturesque I am probably goings to sleep Might wake up later will text   ()/attachment.jpeg Oh I thought uniqlo was in Korea? Japan, and it has a couple stores in the US, at least  (one in SF and NYC) but might have opened more in the last two years My day went from a raisin to a pineapple and then to an orange Do you like oranges and cranberries? I hate eating oranges and cranberries but like products of them Do you like those fruits I hate oranges and raisins but love pineapple. Cranberries are so good though. Anyway, go to sleep )   This place is so rich that there is a mazerati, Ferrari, and tesla dealership that I saw   ()/attachment.jpg   ()/attachment.jpg Ay Is that your view from the apartment?! How scenic. How was your hair? Omg I meant how was your day. Words from the conversation accidentally made their way into that text lol. Somebody said hair. Yep that was the dawn view So I couldn't really sleep last night, only like  Min at a time and then not able to go back, but too exhausted to watch a movie or something so I just lay there. This morning I got some benadryl to control the itching and it made me so drowsy so I napped all day except to eat Wbu? I lose and regain my voice continually Apparently related to the breathing tube I had while under? I didn't know I had a breathing tube ( I'm sorry, that sounds awful. Do you think it's the painkillers? Oh the Benadryl I had a great day! Shannon has been eating lunch with us recently and today Erica and sienna joined us. Had a debate in language about walden Saw Mr. Ramirez and a bunch of graduates from years ago and last year In seminar we played with this interactive timeline program called Gapminder, you should look it up. Have you ever had laughing gas lol? I remember once I did and I got to choose the scent. And Diviya got me Doritos I am forever grateful  I have gap minder!! I found it on a school computer years ago and was enchanted It is so cool Never had laughing had Gas Lol for you air is practically laughing gas How was the lunch conversation It is the coolest thing I'm downloading it as soon as I can. Also we did wiki races which I feel like we should do sometime. Lol I've laughed so much over the past week, I have many many stories to tell you Any to share? I'm so bored Shannon was teaching me some hebrew words she knew and I wrote some on her arm. We talked about a bunch of things idk Ok so Bella, jay, and I were talking about how when you and Joseph and jay get together you're the worst and most condescending group ever And how you guys argue over the dumbest shit And Bella said that she had a recording of some drunken argument where you and jay were arguing over who was richer Lol more like when we do that while drunk Apparently the argument wasn't getting anywhere so you just stopped and said naaah, nigga Normally it's Joseph and jay that argue dumb shit sober It was hilarious  Lol I totally said that I lost my shit when I heard that then in language we were talking about transcendentalism and how it makes us feel when we're in nature, and that abortion girl talia was like as a photographer... Then Connolly cut her off and said only professionals said that that was also really funny Stories are no fun over text ( Abortion girl talia what I suppose  But I insist on hearing the stories when I am back so you have to remember I actually wrote them down Also since everybody already knows thanks to Demi, leo and Zayna broke up What happened He was being super clingy and would constantly ask her why it was taking so long to reply (an hour) How long have they been on the rocks? It seems that I stopped hearing sweet things about them fairly quickly Well he's always been very clingy like refusing to let go of her hand and stuff But during winter break she felt suffocated He would text her nonstop while she was in DC Oh, yes I understand  It is difficult when people are out of town because there can quickly become nothing to talk about without shared stimulus  We usually don't have that issue which is nice! ) Alex's face looks gross. I would not have expected that from some jumping castle accident lol. He looks like somebody beat him up. What a lame story to tell So unimpressive Frankly, I find it so easy to talk to you Really? I didn't see his face after lol. Lol it's like how I have stitches from a water fun accident, but my baseball team said it was a sports accident to make it sound less lame I have a cool basic game theory question for you There are  guys in a three way duel.  Mr black goes first, he has % accuracy. Mr Grey goes second, he has % accuracy Mr white goes third, he has % accuracy. How should mr black shoot? How is your mom Haha a water fun accident? Please do tell Gun* Shoot himself Or shoot three times What's the answer? She's fine! Will be out on  afternoon God I should not be playing trivia crack I am so hopped up OxyContin + Tylenol + benadryl + antibiotics (cephalexin) The answer is he should shoot in the air, and then the next guy will try to shoot mr white Basically buys him time  That's great that she will be out soon The water fun incident 
A dumb kid in second grade put one of those foam covered water guns up to my chin and cocked it (like pull it back) and then pushed out and it ripped my chin skin a lot, but I didn't feel it much. Went in water, pool of blood, urgent care, ended up getting a good number of stitches.  I deleted that app oh my goodness it was way too time consuming Yeah I was thinking he could shoot away and that way it would show that he wasn't meaning any harm Do you have much work this  weekend?  I cannot believe it is already the weekend  No, it's not that, they will try to shoot him anyway lol this is economics not psychology But they will try to shoot those with more likelihood of killing them, AKA the other two people So he doesn't want to kill one of the others because then the one left will only try to hit him Oh my goodness. Speaking of pool stories, once when I was in th grade there was this girl named Brandie and we were playing footsies and kicking each other, and I accidentally got my big toe into her vagina I have lots of work this weekend. Do you? Have you been emailing teachers? 
No, I talked to them before I left. When I get back I will have to make up a bio quiz, work on history presentation, turn in an SRP syllabus, and start on a Spanish paper. Which sounds like a lot but all in all won't take more than an afternoon. What do you have to do Lol what did brandie (stripper name...) say? Lol that would at least take me a whole day. I have APUSH reading, bio problems, Chinese project, language reading, math set, seminar essay. You know since I'm guaranteed an SRP with seminar, I want to go to the Middle East. Like turkey or israel or Lebanon I want to study something related to Islamophobia  Or idk, it's just really interesting I'm doing a project on Cholent  And I'm making some! Brandie swam away ( it was a sad moment 
Islamophobia would be difficult to study in a Muslim country, more easy in Europe or Israel. Also, I would think it unsafe for you to go to an Islamic country... Unless you really really pounded out your feminine behavior, no offense at all, but I think you would be at risk.  What cholent recipe are you using? What do you mean guaranteed? How does that work with seminar? Plus you would need to find a reputable advisor in the Middle East, plus parental and school agreement. Maybe Turkey, I suppose it's relatively stable, but less so with Recep Tayyip Erdogan Maybe go there on your own after you graduate? The SRP requirements are so limiting, plus the school doesn't want liability, no one has ever went somewhere unstable like that Then again Charlotte is kinda doing that maybe you could talk to her It's kinda like how I wanted to do HIV for SRP. It's just very hard to get the right connections When is all that work due 
Yeah, my top choices were Israel and Turkey. Also that was one of my concerns, especially in Egypt, so that's why I would rather go to Israel. And for the seminar thing, we were told that next year our project counts for an SRP and that we would have access to international databases and resources so traveling is definitely an option.  I'm using a vegetarian Cholent recipe because not everybody does meat Emily went to Uganda...? What's Charlotte doing? Also what do you mean an HIV thing? What would you do? This is for next year and it's basically an entire year dedicated for the project we want to do. Don Lemon is so cute, damn. 
Didn't you fail a class at some point? Does it exempt you from that requirement? I mean I hope all that is true, but they upsold is the SRP as well, and it was underwhelming for everyone, what little support they gave us. Though I'm sure with your drive you could figure something out Yes I forgot about Emily! You are right.  Charlotte is doing a trip around Asia and then writing a paper about it, it's barely a thing. She just told them she is going on a trip whether they take it as an SRP or not, so they did I wanted to get an internship with either an HIV organization or medical business in the field, but there are just very few positions if you are not  and do not have great prior networking Yes but what is in the cholent? Wheat? Potatoes? What? He is! I was reading the about us page on the surgeon's website, and my doctor is like  years older than I thought (like ), and has been with his partner for like  years ) black people age so well Upsold us* Hi I'm sorry I've been with mommy Her friend is so liberal and cultured. We've been talking about musicals and how Fox is so conservative and the Moors and about The Graduate. We even talked about sexual harassment in the Air Force  I've never failed a class, only a final. Yeah my mom told me she would pay for me to go wherever I wanted. Also rosinbum has many historians as friends so there's that too. What's the paper on? I think it's going to be potatoes. The recipe is on my laptop, I'll let you know. Lol I looked at his about us page too...  Aww that's so cute. Probably met in med school lol. Who is this friend? I'm glad you went to visit her ) I look so scruffy and gross because I cannot raise my arms enough to shave, and my mom says appearances don't matter now and she's tired.  
 too! I've been here since  and it's been great. She's a coworker who also faced discrimination in the office so my mom was helping her out and they became good friends. Did you want her to shave you? Everything will be better soon hahah Have you showered? Aimee, I am relieved that everything worked out for you with this surgery and I am glad that you are doing fine. I really care about you and I think about how you are doing all the time.   What did she face? See that sounds weird but otherwise I'll be all pube beardy by the time we get back, so yes. Well I am not allowed to shower for  days.. The dressing cannot get at all wet. But my mom helped wash my hair and face today. Thank you Well since she's in her s they wanted some fresh blood so the people at the Legal Defenders were mean to her Well since she's in her s they wanted some fresh blood so the people at the Legal Defenders were mean to her It doesn't sound weird??? My mom had me wash her feet and legs with a washcloth and soap because she isn't allowed to take showers either. I would understand if my mom also wanted me to shave her legs or something I tweeze my underarms but lately I've been pulling the hair out by hand That sounds incredibly painful, that's like tweeting pubes or worse Nah it feels fine Not tweeting, tweezing lol Why did you do that Instead of cheating or not doing it Li Lol Instead of cheating? It evolved from boredom Anyway good night! I don't even know what that said I do not remember what it was supposed to mean Eh that's alright. I am mentally cloudy idk, I think it's all this medicine Do you want to sleep? I actually got a good night of sleep I can leave you alone if you want No I'm fine I can leave you alone though Haha no I just woke up again Oh it is  I thought it was a weekday I had this dream that everybody started to become obsessed with the Middle East like I was and then we just didn't talk anymore because you became this Middle Eastern prodigy And then everybody wanted to be friend with a Jew so we didn't eat lunch anymore Lol do you ever have dreams that we get closer and have great times? Hahaha I do but I don't share them. Maybe I should, huh? In the dream we also watched Cabaret In one of my grandpa's beds together  It was really cute I just feel like the abnormal stuff would interest you more so that's what I tell you Omg! And in the dream I went to the doctor's office and they told me I was positive for HIV and then they also told me I was positive for drug use  Lol I like hearing almost all dreams I find them interesting Lol sorry, I inject you with dirty needle heroin while you sleep why did I say lol twice? I do not know Did I wake you up You can sleep For some reason I read the injection text in a Russian and Scottish accent Did you finish cabaret Like I subconsciously did it because I probably saw heroine out of my peripheral   You did not wake me up. I actually fell asleep last night on the floor of the living room on top of an encyclopedia  And then I woke up about  minutes later then moved to a bed Then I woke up around  and went back to sleep ( for some reason when I stream over cellular data it's so slow Have you watched any movies? Lol what were you reading that put you right to sleep in the encyclopedia. I remember I used to want an encyclopedia until I realized the convenience of Wikipedia.  I am about to finish pretty woman and I watched encino man on  Ok well I read about the Suez Canal, Israel, Israeli music, and Islamic law. I started falling asleep around Islam. Lol cos I called you out on the suez  My grandpa got the set of encyclopedias in exchange for a vacuum cleaner. That is true! Thank you for doing so Sounds like a fair deal. Encyclopedias used to be ducking expensive They're from the 's. Verrryyyyy outdated But interesting in perspective! Comes from the times of Arab socialism which I was thought was an interesting concept Encino Man oh my goodness. My alcoholic aunt recommended that almost every single day so I was very repulsed to see it They still call Egypt the United Arab republic It was only that for like very few years It's actually pretty cool, did you read the wiki on it United for a time with Syria I have not read the wiki on it. All that I knew was that it was for a few years, but I shall do that. Wiki is pretty much how I learned everything It is really one of the greatest resources man has developed like ever Tell me  wiki papes to peruse through  *pages Well I don't have any off the top of my head, but I'll send interesting ones your way I used to spend hours starting at one page, reading it all, seeing what it linked to, reading some of those etc. How about the  Iranian coup d'état  I wish I had time to do that.. Ok then you look up Warren Jeffs I have before lol Many times You want me to again though? Hahaha that's alright I read a cool article about FLDS. I think it was maybe in Time? Idk. It had a lot of photos Middle Eastern countries overthrowing democratically elected officials Where have I seen that before But It was backed by CIA.. Ooooooh It's very important background with Iran and explains a lot of their continuing resentment I was wondering what FLDS was and then I said fundamentalist LDS and then looked it up and I was right And it led to the  revolution  You know those moments where you're content with your reasoning skills yes s s Resentment towards US? Yes, and the western world generally Mostly US Panteha's dad is really interesting to talk to about Iran, I regret not speaking to him more. He's very informed and a huge critic, probably mostly due to his athei s m Do you know what the reason is for the spread of FLDS intoxico? I think it is because for a time polygamy was legal or tolerated there But I am not su r e My next thing is to tackle the history of Iran and Iraq. I've been meaning to do that for quite some time. Next week though, Sara invited me over for dinner so that I can experience 'Arab immersion' Where is her family from agai n ? Tunisia and Palestine... Tunisia sounds like an alright pla c e I think some grandparents lived in Palestine but then moved to Tunisia, so she considers herself part Palestinian  I want to visit morocco Do you know about Zoroastrianism? Or Ba'h a i I also want to visit morocco. It just feels seems so disconnected from the rest of the Arab world because not much is going on. I remember hearing the word in th and th grade history classes *it seems It is much more moderate it seems. And it has to be to maintain its tourism industry Those are also possibly interesting wiki pages .   I currently have open -  Iranian coup d'état  - Iranian Revolution - FLDS - Morocco - Zoroastrianism I'll tell you where I end up by the end of the day Probably flannels Lol  o k ) How are you doing? What's going on today I am doing okay, it is just another day of laying in bed but maybe today I will be here enough to watch a movie or something. I've hair been sleeping pretty much all the time, and being women up for meals It is enough mental exertion to try and figure out what drugs to take at what tim e s being women up for meals I assume you meant beating women up for meals? Just wait until Diviya hears about this.  I just got off Woken Lol Got off as in masturbate? Being woken up for mea l s Yes, that kind of got off. I've been doing it every night. Also I thought of you! So yay Lol yay I think once I get home it won't be long until we can do it again Or at least BJs, I'm not in bad conditi o n Omg Every night?!? Unusual for you, n o ? Basically the way it happens is that I keep promising myself I'm going to try things from the back and then I never do. I get too scared. So I figure why not just do it since I'm already down there ( Also I'm exhausted by the end of the night and I tell myself it's a good stress reliever so I do it You should, I don't want to be the first to do anything up there to you. I had sure done it to myself before I let you all up in the r e Did you use soap or what I think dry tbh I forget My fingers are not large I cannot jerk off bc my arms are too painful, plus parents /. I'm gonna be so horny when I get back . . Did you enjoy it though? How did it feel for you? I'm going to do it sometime this week, that's a promise. What happens though is that I lie down in the tub and start rubbing Then it just feels so tight and I'm scared to go in If you are scared it will clench and hurt You have to be comfortable  Eh I like dick in it a lot more, finger just kinda feels like shitti n g What does the former feel like? I am comfortable when I'm trying, maybe I'm just naturally tight. I only get scared as I'm trying to get it in And it's not doing anything  If you don't have a lot of pain when you shit there is no reason it should be that tight when you try to go in if you are relaxed Well, it depends on the angle, a lot. I couldn't really describe it though because we've only done it a few times and not recentl y   Doesn't shitting feel peaceful though Does it ever hurt???  I think it feels peaceful Yes if it's TOO large, it has happened to me, a painful shit Like really f a t Hahaha I'm laughing so hard I meant does anal ever hurt Wait did you ever seen encino m a n But yes ( those hurt too but sometimes they feel good after they come out Fuck yes anal can hurt  It can hurt like a motherfucker if you aren't wet or prepp e d No, the movie looked bad... It gets wet back there....? Or someone has to do it Well, either through lube, or for me the naturally occurring lube from the front can get back there and get my ass wet it was a silly movie. I guess it wasn't good but it entertaining enough. You probably wouldn't like  i t Ok I figure that's what it was or that you're sweaty lol. Lol that would be grosser by a l o t Did you see the Rotten Tomatoes rating?! No? I don't like RT. imdb all tha w a y I guess so but I wouldn't know Not that it did well on imdb I just think some movies are so bad that they are great Not encino man, but some movies There is a guy in pretty woman that looks kinda like Martha's d a d Do you ever listen to music and lip sync like you're performing? That's what I was just doing Who's the actor? ( )  /attachment.jpg This is such a bad pic of my mom but this is what she looks like حبيبي احبك I do that sometimes His name is hector elizondo She looks a lot like you in that pic Habib i ! Oh wow he does look like Martha's dad in the movie. Not now though. Really..? I think I look nothing like her. Habibi❤️ Well mostly her skin tone and the dimples And head shape Who are the two women God I finally shaved, finally. I pretty much have a full beard in a week minus the cheeks. If I let it grow for a month it would be a damn good bea r d The lady on the left is a new face. Never seen her before. However the lady on the right is Isabel. She's so sweet. We went to her home for dinner one night. You should have taken a picture! Damn it Sergio that snap was such a good pic of you goddamn You should do your hair like that !(  )  /attachment.JPG ( )  /attachment.JPG I really like these pictures lol they're going on Instagram  I couldn't get good lighting ( I had like a scruffy mustache and stuff. But in general I look like a mess Lol with the Arabic script? ? ? Yeah I kept the arabic scripts it's really pretty Hahaha I'm sure you didn't look too bad ) Lol I hope you don't have church people on your insta They gon call the F B I Church people do follow me ( actually it's funny because as you sent that I was looking at one of their profiles They never like my pics anymore after I posted the Little Prince picture Which little prince pic? Sorry I don't have Instagram so I would not kn o w Oh right, I thought you saw it when you were looking through my phone Basically it was a picture of the book but the caption included his book ❤️ or something like that  And then people from school commented and it was just really dumb What did they commen t ? But the people from church don't like my pictures anymore. What if it was my grandpas book huhhhhh Aww So cute Of course with a bunch of emojis ) ) Instagram is such a waste of time It is But so is like everythi n g I'll delete it but then download it again I am watching this Swedish film It's less a waste than evil appl e s What is the film called? We are the bes t ! Fuck! Evil apples oh my goodness glad that's over Is that what it's called or are you just saying that hahah That is the name of the film But we a r e ) Is it one of those teen scene movies? I didn't know you were into that kind of thing Don't know yet, I'm not far into it, but I think it's a movie meant for adults, just kind of like insight into the cute and silly young mind.  And their futile but silly pursuit s   There's this movie I want to see about a child who is unhappy with his life so he runs away into nature and ends up freezing to death. It's an interesting play on naïveté. Question Yea h ? Do you say futile like few-tile or like few-tuhl  What is the movie call e d I was hoping you would know I use them interchangeably Depends on the sentence Usually it's kind of a blend of the two, not really eith e r Oh ok I like to say fewtile because it's how they say it in those sci fi movies haha What movie should my mom and I watch today? / Jk jk I don't know, what genre does she li k e Basically everything but horror Never seen /! Midnight in Pari s ? I'm scared to open Zöe's snapchats now that she got a phone or something  I don't want to talk to her again Made it halfway through that movie in th grade You probably missed most of the references to literature then though so it was less great Mm get one of those apps That lets you open it without it appearing to be opened Like snapbox So she won't know I don't think you should talk to her, she is batshit, and once you get in you won't want to be a dick to her and tell her to fuck o f f I remember getting bored very quickly But I'll watch it again now that I am a more worldly person haha I do not understand how it is so easy for some people to tell others to fuck off... She is crazy but I felt like if I was her friend then I could discover the reason behind it Well you were also crazy.  See that is why you need not to get involved because you could not detach her from y o u Okay but I wasn't crazy last year and she still was. I sat with her every morning... Once her and Tess got into this argument and that was bad. Well I don't tell people explicitly ever to fuck off, I just taper off communication But you weren't really a friend of hers as much last ye a r
I had math with her. She sat right in front of me. One thing is that I understand her family situation but could not figure out why she had to be so rash and rude but then complained when people acted the same way towards her or others. I try doing that but then I feel like an asshole 
Well it's not really intentional, if I don't get along with someone we naturally won't have much to talk about so usually it just happens on it's own because neither of us gets much out of the conversation. But then there are people like Anna Marie, she is the only one that I think I will one day have to legitimately block She probably didn't realize her hypocris y   My mom is already talking about her will because they're fearing she might go unconscious for a while  Well Zoe used to do all the talking and I would nod my head Why would she go unconscious? Are things looking bad right now ? ? She makes it sound like she's going to die this month or something She's already telling me about how we're going to get monthly payments and I'm getting the car and all this stuff Her blood pressure just suddenly dropped  Does she look ok? What is going on? Are doctors surrounding her? She is being irresponsible, freaking you out like th a t And she's talking about who's going to claim me and put me under their social security benefits because I don't have a father She looks fine... Keizer's mom does my mom's cardiographs. They rushed over when her blood pressure dropped I think she is just having a realization of mortality and taking it out on you because she has no one else to rant to about it. It is difficult to realize that you are fallible Is it back up now? How do you feel about Keizer's mom being the person Are you with your m o m What do you mean I'm fallible? It's not my responsibility to take any of these plans into action.   No  n o My grandpa is also here with us. It's mainly their conversation but they're asking me the occasional questions. You're going to live with grandpa and not with your friends, right? It's not back up yet but soon I think it's strange... Especially since Keizer told her he has gay friends but I don't know if she knows it's me When I said you I meant in reference to oneself. It is difficult for one to realize their own mortality. That is what I meant Not that you are fallible, that she is fallible. That everyone is mortal. I am not phrasing things well, sorry Is his mom homophobic How do you know soon? What are they doing to help the blood pressure come  u p Yeah I agree, I don't think now was the perfect time to discuss such matters.  His mom is super homophobic. KZ's dad also said if he was gay he could cut of KZ's balls  Do you think KZ is maybe actually gay but doesn't want it getting out for fear of his parents? Or bi or just not % straight Kinda like Anthony but to a greater degr e e They took her off mess Well basis provides an environment where someone should (at least for me?) feel comfortable coming out, so I think he would have already? Idk. Perhaps bi. Oh goodness Anthony. I texted him this morning because I felt bad for not replying all week and he said Hahahaha like a week later Better late than never I guess Ok so you kinda do do what I do... In terms of not communicating with people ( Aww what's wrong Haha yeah, but not with you. I mean with certain people too I don't feel obligated to reply back within a reasonable time Especially friends What have you been doing? It's just sad the whole situation with your mom and how she is handling it, she is doing things that really are stressful to other you know I am watching we are the best still. It's hard for me to focus so it takes a long ti m e Oh btw I didn't mean mess, I meant meds. They lowered her dosage. 
 I caught th a t Yeah we just ate lunch together and during prayer I just started crying, I couldn't do it  Is it good? Yeah it's pretty funny and cute  It's endearing ((  Is she still gonna be released soon? This is super TMI but I haven't shit in like - days bc of pain meds and I'm so bloated and gross. I took  laxatives a couple hours ago and still nothing. I am worried I will explode or something. I look so f a t That's so unhealthy!!!!! Have you been eating?? I've actually gone that long without pooping too because I was embarrassed for people to know I was going poop. I was a strange kid. This was during a Boy Scout camp. She'll be out on  if all goes well. Have you tried using the bathroom? Or do you just not feel the need to poop Yes! I have been eating quite a lot. I don't know how my intestines are handling it. That is strange... Then what? She won't go straight back to work, right? So I haven't really tried but I don't feel the urge at all, and it hurts to walk and exert myself so I would rather not cross the apartment in vain. It may have to happen though .   I was just very embarrassed to have other people know that my body does the normal functions. She won't.. I don't know what she's going to do. Maybe you should try? Actually no if it hurts then don't bother, but you can't keep holding it in even if you don't feel like you have to. Ok after this movie finishes in  min I will go To be fair many people are ashamed of masturbation and that's a normal function too, so I guess it's not that abnormal Is it all ok with her job? Like she has sick time or whatever? They won't fire her right ? ? But I didn't do that until last year and when I would deny it people always said I was lying Idk ( she's going to continue working at DEA hopefully They know she's in the hospital  We're watching this super dramatic lifetime movie about teen partying and it's giving my mom such a bad idea about what we do at parties What is it called? What happens in the movie. Lol dramatic and lifetime movie together is  redundant.  Mm I think that's because you were so ridiculously sexual that it was hard to believe you weren't wanking  i t It's called The Choking Game hahah. Some new trend to get high. http//www.mylifetime.com/movies/the-choking-game 'Wanking it' There is this movie on Lifetime called Whitney I want to see. Angela Bassett is in it! I just saw the advertisement for that when I clicked the link Who is Angela Bassett. . . She was in Malcolm X, American Horror Story, and Boyz n the Hood Is it true AHS is doing an OJ Simpson spinoff? ? ? No, I thought it was just the OJ Simpson trial covered by Ryan Murphy? Oh you are probably right. Caleb said that and I was like w t f Does he watch AHS too? Yeah. He is really boring. I think in a similar manner to Antho n y Lol Anthony is so quick to reply to me, like always within  minutes, but his responses are so mundane no matter what I tell him. Same.. With Cal e b And all he does is watch tv Did he make any friends In college When do you want to watch moonri s e Yeah he has a couple of friends but he says he doesn't really like any of them and he wishes he never went to Kenyon Or rather when do you think you will have time ( poor guy. Why doesn't he transfer to u of a and save $ $ $ I was trying to watch it in this hospital but they block EVERYTHING We can do it tonight if you want? ) Like all useful websites or all video? Ok! If I'm awake lol My dressing is so tight. I'm trying to remember what the doc said about messing with it if it hurt, but all I seem to remember is that he said they sewed on nipple pillows to my skin.. Surgery is wei r d I have no idea! Maybe I'll ask him haha I am afraid that my college experience will be like his. It sounds horrib l e Yes, YouTube and Netflix and illegal movie streaming sites haha Nipple pillows? How does that work? Do they ever come off? My mom is going to apply for temporary disability Her doctor told her to Ok this is a stupid question but do you still have your nipples or did you get new ones? Nope they are never coming off, I got new nipples tattooed on Just kidding! I kept mine lol They were reduced in size though, and moved to a more masculine position It is just to protect the nipples because they got moved ya feel How long is temporary ? Do you know when breast augmentation and reduction surgeries started happening in the US? I just gave my mom a bath and cleaned her hair and body Not sure, maybe a month or two? Just until her doctor tells her she can work again. Well, before I answer your q I must say this is not considered either of those, what I got is a lot more involved of a procedure.  It appears breast augmentations began in the 's mostly though.  My mom washed my hair  min ago Oh. Maybe it will be a welcome break for her She doesn't have a nurs e ? Oh ok, I'm sorry. I didn't know.  Is it strange for your mom to wash your body? Like your back and legs?  She does but the final orders come from the doctor. She did not wash my body lol. I would be weirded out by that It's fine haha no reason why you would know No I mean she doesn't have a nurse to bathe her?? That's seems like something you wouldn't be expected to  d o She's not supposed to bathe because she needs to stay hooked up to the machines... So I used a washcloth and some soap and washed her. I would also be weirded out to have my mom wash me The nurse did offer to change her clothes but I don't think my mom felt comfortable So I had to do it instead I don't mind though How is she feeling? Has she said anythin g ? She is grateful that I helped her and feels clean. We're still watching shitty lifetime movies haha. Speaking of shitty, did you use the restroom Also did you finish your movie? I have not, though I did try to go. And yes it was ok not great. I then started Kramer vs Kramer. I'm  Min into it I'm going on a drive now. First time leaving the apt for a couple da y s That's great! Be safe ) #seatbelt So the house out apartment is in is worth $.M. Shit here is ridiculous. Though the view is amazing. I'll send the pics later O u r I still have pictures of the view and I could imagine breathing in fresh air while looking out at the water. Also that is ridiculous, like more expensive than NYC Well, it might be a decently sized house I'm not sure I haven't seen the other half but it looks a bit bigger Anyway, what is up with your brothe r s Oh oh oh Omg I'm such an idiot I thought it was just that apartment not the whole house Oops I haven't seen them in days but apparently they're supposed to come over tonight.  You know what's weird? My brother's dad (who has a girlfriend and a new son) told my mom he still loves her and always has... You're not going to formal, right? When is it? That is very awkward with brother's dad... Also he is a shit head I hope she doesn't actually consider him an option Ok I just looked it up- no I won't be in town, and even if I was there is no way I can do that a week from now ( Well I might get there on the th during the day actually Maybe I can come to the before events? Like the prep?  I want to be a part of it but I definitely cannot dance or stand or anything for  hou r s It's the th! I just bought my ticket today. Oh yeah that would be fun. Or we could leave early maybe? Maybe at  or ? She doesn't consider him in any way hahah don't worry Well I won't have anything to do once we get there and I know you like dancing and stuff so you should go for the whole time, I'll just get dinner with you guys before if possib l e I was just going to suggest that. We always go to ihop so that would be nice ) That'll probably be  though so it might not be good for you I meant before, like if we ate before? After would not be good for me Maybe we could get a light meal? Or just meet up at Madeleine's before to put on clothes/makeup/hang out  Or Diviya's  Being out late is not a good option for me. Also don't count me in for driving because I cannot dri v e Yeah well I know Madeleine and Diviya have to spend a long time at La Paloma to set up So I think they're only doing dinner after / Well maybe I can hang out with you guys at la Paloma before? Try to help out in small way s ? You're so cute But you'll have to ask Amanda first hahah! Fucking hate he r   So is that a no? You don't have to strain yourself! I can still see you that weekend if you want? It's a  day weekend. Well I don't know I just want to do something related to the event if possible but if not, that's how it  i s Also Diviya said they're not doing anything beforehand Only setting up. Ok then I guess we will just hang out sometime over the weekend I hope you have a fun time ) And don't let Zayna say I'm ditching you lol, I'll have you know that I would much prefer a dance to staying in bed but it is simply not an opti o n You know anybody could just walk into the hospital and go into any room, it's terrible. Lol when I told her you might not go she rolled her eyes But I might just go with Reyna or Martha  Also I'm so excited to get a tie for the theme!!!! ( Did you explain why at least I'm not going to her? Also moonrise tonight..? What tie will you ge t I just told her that you were in San Francisco and that you don't like to dance. Well it depends which girl I go with because that determines the color of my tie Mmmmm maybe / turns out my brothers are coming home with us so I'll have to put Alex to sleep, but I could ask Richie to do it for once I'll say ? If that's okay with you? Actually good news (for you) My brothers might not come lol So maybe  Ok, if it's before  ok but if it's after that we'll just watch it another day. No pressure at all thou g h We can always watch it next week too? Yeah that's fi n e How was your time out? 
Nice, but cut short by having to get back to take antibiotics. We saw the entrance to the San Quentin prison as well as the ferry to San Francisco proper. It is interesting that there is almost nothing directly on the bay.  How was your d a y That's nice! I've never heard of the San Quentin prison. Tiring... I've been at hospital all day. We have been watching those forensics shows. Which forensics shows? Yeah it's like death row for Cali, it's pretty isolated, many guard towers and gates and things .   Forensics Files, it was scary ( also America's Most Wanted scared me throughout my whole childhood. My grandpa got here and one of the first things he said was, at church today there werexicans! Just like the old days Was he trying to say that in previous times there were morexicans at his church? Did he ever attend another denomination? Pretty sure the further you go back (in recent times)xicans were more uniformly catholi c   He grew up as a catholic but converted in early adulthood. Our church has had some success in missionary work, especially in Africa and Europe. I'm not sure what he meant. I know that there has been a low turnout in the church for years now. What have you been doing? Europe? Like what part of Europe?  Well, I just finished Kramer vs. Kramer which was about a divorce and gender roles in the 's. It won best picture, but it's hard to see why without the relevance of gender politics and divorce.  Now I might watch another film. I am not sure.  I think you would like this http//www.optivism.com/ It has a bunch of popular radio stations from various countri e s Mmmmm France for sure. Spain too, I think? Yeah I read about Kramer vs. Kramer. I'm adding it to my list. Well if you want to watch Moonrise Kingdom I will be home before ... Thank you! I will definitely check it out soon. I don't think you would like it it's pretty uninteresting as a story, but if you want! It's literally exactly what I meant when I said old movies tend to have less interesting plots, it's all nuanced I suppose but not if you know the nuances of the time.  Not if you don't know* Lets watch it another d a y Alright Did you decide on a movie to watch? I'm watching Psycho Sorry I spaced I'm gonna watch the apartment.  I thought you saw that film alrea d y What order are you going in or how do you choose the movies No, that was half of vertigo Well, now I'm onto the th list, since I only had  left on the rd after pretty woman, so I just chose what looked alright.  Why didn't you finish vertig o   I don't understand why you choose some of the movies you do though, like encino man. It was on a school night and I watched half then never finished Couldn't say why, some of the premises just strike me, cos they are original I guess. Like encino man or minority report, I just wanted to know how they would turn out.  
Encino man in particular was referenced on reddit and linked in some clip and it was so ridiculous that I thought I had to see it, and I'm always looking for dumb films to intersperse, because I can't watch the godfather  times a week How do you pick movi e s Usually there are some movies on Netflix that I'll see that are also on my list, not in any particular order, so I'll just watch it. I don't go list by list, but rather one list collectively.  Tonight it was between precious, psycho, and rain man. Whatever I watch varies on my mood. Sunday  What mood inspired psycho? Just kidding Anyway I'm going to sleep So good night ! ! Oh alright Goodnight  I just fingered myself quite a few times and it was the most amazing thing ever I was so out of breath and it felt so different I love it Wo w ! Yup haha I can't believe you never did that before Anyway how is your today looking I had very strange dreams- I was at a Harvard physics class at one, I don't really remember the others well but I know they were weird I remember giving a dick massage W b u We were on the same dodgeball team and you weren't very good, so the judge gave you a bunch of supplies and you only won because of them. I was really upset and didn't talk to you. Lots of hw, wbu That is strange, a lot of my dreams had that sort of theme, winning because of reasons like that. Well I'm really tied up, Tina of homework in all my classes plus prior engagements of all kinds-- I'll be watching movies all d a y That's so unfair. Maybe I'll get my wisdom teeth out next. Doesn't today feel different  It does to me What does anything have to do with wisdom teeth? Lol not particularly to me. That was yesterday that felt differe n t Well you're only able to watch movies with all that hw because you're not in town ( unless you're emailing stuff? What happened yesterday? Why do we pronounce 'one' the way we do I don't actually have any homework, I was joking. Even if I was in town I wouldn't have homework haha. 
Yesterday I stopped taking oxy and switched to Tylenol and it was a new age. Didn't realize how out of it I was til I was past it. The past two days were a complete blur. I don't get why people abuse it though there was no pleasant feeling or anything, just mental fog Should I leave you to complete your work peacefull y ? Let me just say I really want to have anal I needed to get that out there My mom is so ridiculous when it comes to addictions and methods of getting high. She makes it sound like she's the expert on all of it and thinks she knows not only why people start, but the feeling of it. I don't start work until like  or  hahah. This morning I've been lazy. I think I'm a bottom I got that impression.. What do you want to do about thi s ? Lol well I used a bunch of lube so we definitely need to be in a bed Ok how do you feel about strap ons... I love the way you phrased the text, like my newfound love for bottoming is so problematic. I can still top though! If that's what you're worried about. Actually I feel bad now you can just ignore it all 
I don't know for what cause but I've been emotionally strange while pent up and gross here. I see myself in the mirror unshowered and with messed up hair in sweatpants, and bloated for (still) lack of ability to go to the bathroom (TMI sorry) and I wonder what you could see in me. I need to get back to the normal routine, haha. There is no reason your newfound love should harm out relationship and it is only my insecurity in thinking so. So in short, lol I'm cool w strapons. What! No! Why would you feel bad ?  
I think regardless of the meds, those feelings are normal in a relationship because I always feel the same way. Also it's not TMI lol, my mom is in the hospital right now and I'm taking care of her too. It's sad because they didn't want her walking so she had to use a portable toilet seat right next to her bed. Idk I thought that the strap on question had offended you And I only want to do things that we're both comfortable with Ok basically I thought that I made you think I was dissatisfied with you because you lacked what I need to fulfill my newfound love but that wasn't the case at all No why would that offend me? I'm totally comfortable with that though I wonder how we would acquire such a thing. I can't ask an  year old senior to buy a strap on in the same way I could ask one to buy a bong 
Yes that is what I felt momentarily but it wasn't your fault, and was easily resolved. I don't have any issue with strapons in principle or negative emotional assosiation I just hoped you were happy and satisfied with the options availab l e I think it's funny that this is a conversation about strap ons. Maybe Anna Marie and you could tell her it's a gag gift. But I completely understand what you're saying.  I am satisfied ) You're wonderful Ok I'll research things ) 
 hour phone call? Where are you? D pic. . ? Yeah I was on the phone with my mom for  hours It just felt like it You want a d pic? I'm at house Yes! Great 
Ok also, you will at some point watch lost in translation, as I did. And I didn't really get what the big deal was but I just read this review and now I do. So after you watch it, be sure to read this. Put it in your notes or something  http//www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-lost-in-translation- That was awesome / Very appreciated thank y o u More or no? Yes The first one was so hot   ) That was really hot for me too Lol God I think I had forgotten what it meant to be horny and have nothing to do about it. I am so horny I could cry And each reminder is such a welcome tease that I couldn't look away if distracted by $ just offscreen (and I'm a jew so that's a big dea l ) I'll watch the movie this week! There are some hidden reminders of us having sex throughout my days   ? Like taking out the garbage to the alley and then I'm like oh, we had sex in this alley once Or I got a blowjob Also the Jew thing was really funny when I read it earlier You actually make me laugh sometimes P When you send your treasure trail pics it's mesmerizing  You are great Haha walk into an alley, hmm I think I have a blowjob here once .(. )  /attachment.jpeg 🌷💕☺️ Lol I feel like I can pretty much say that now. Jk jk It is so foggy here, it is like we are in a cloud. One could believe there is nothing around because you can't see more than a couple meters.  Where are you n o w I've been in fog before at a Boy Scout camp in San Diego! We slept in this huge outdoor ramada on a hill and then when we woke up we were above the fog and it was slowly creeping up towards us. I was also in a cloud this summer on Mt. Lemmon Grandpa's backyard watching Alex. He's out and about.  Pics? Well most of the fog is gone now, it was much worse earlier. But here is a comparison of now and yesterday when there was no fog  ( )  /attachment.jpg ( )  /attachment.jpg Though earlier I could not see past the tree, nor could I see the ground below it When you are free again of responsibility promptly tell  m e Those houses are pretty nice but not worth the millions What floor are you on? Haha why? Did you want another d session Location location location! I'm in the bottom floor? There are  floors and apartment takes up the bottom one.  No......... ...y e s So then the owner lives on the top? Lol are you serious Well the owner's daughter I think. The owner and his wife live in France .   I am free of responsibility And am promptly telling you Pants are a responsibility  You should continue Hahahahaha . That was so funny your fat face in background and d tip in foreground like a monster  . It is clear that someone has a newfound love for his re a r You're mean ( What? I meant fat face endearingl y   Yeah I'm sorry, I won't send that if you don't want me to Lol why are you sorry I have no issue! I just thought it was fun n y No I meant if you don't want rear pics I do, I do You are hearing what you are afraid I will say rather than what I am sayi n g That's true to some extent I just thought you only liked the dick But I was so into it that I just sent the rear pics And then when you said that idk It is all great How is everything there Your mom and all that is she doing bett e r You see, I'm self conscious too Everything is good. We're going home to vail now to feed animals and get clothes She's fine and coming home mañana.  What have you even done all day? Who has fed them until now? Lol no reason for you to be you are like sculpted.  I have been trying to watch the apartment. I am most of the through now She isn't supposed to walk and they want her to come home ?   Guess who has been feeding them!!! Nobody!!!!!!! It's sickening!!!! Nobody cares about them. Sculpted It's true have you seen your ass lately It's like a perfect bubble butt Do you not have neighbors what the fuck what if they di e d Oh she wasn't supposed to walk from Sunday- I'm sorry your household does not deserve animals You let them go, starve them. . . We do but nobody coordinates anything with them You is the wrong word. You guys@ It's my mom and my brother. I specifically chose not to own any animals because I knew with all my homework I would not be able to give it the attention it needs. My ass actually has gotten bigger and my waist has gotten smaller. You aren't blameless. You are  years old, you could figure something out. They are your responsibility as well even if you don't want them Especially the poor turtles ( But they are probably ok and hibernating and for that you are lucky You measure your as s ? They are! But the sugar gliderss  That's the problem My mom doesn't trust any of the neighbors to come into our home...  And friends are not willing to drive all the way out to feed our animals Ok I don't exactly measure it with a tape measurer but I do it by appearance and with my hands Gliderss Do you keep around body pics of you r s Gliderss was a typo Back when I posted them on tumblr yes, but not so much anymore. When I do though I delete them fairly soon. I know it was just funny. You posted shirtless etc. on tumblr ? ? I always fear I'm going to accidentally put a video/pic I'm sending you in my story Yes... Didn't I tell you that? Gloria had started me on this website called daily booth and then I thought 'why not on tumblr?' I think you mentioned it but I didn't remember I am afraid of posting to story too  What is daily booth? ,   ,   Hahaha during class that day Nico raised his hand and said something like oh I think Thoreau was trying to place monetary value on those animals and Connolly  told him he was close Then immediately after kristie raised her hand and said oh! Like money? I think he's trying to say something about-- then Connolly cut her off and said no Sara and I burst out laughing because she literally said the same thing And the way Connolly cut her off Does your body feel any different? Did you actually feel lighter after surgery or was it just numb? could you tell something was missing? Sorry my phone died Love Connolly sometimes It just feels like a lot of pressure? It's all wrapped up very tight so I don't know where skin stops and bandage begins at all. I have not a lot of sensati o n How dare your phone die Did you ever have her??? No I never did actually. Strange, as it seems everyone else has Who is your favorite teacher this year, and which is your favorite cla s s My mom brought a stethoscope home and Alex was playing with it, then he put it to my mom's heart and said, it says... I love you! It was so cute. What interactions have you had with her? Do you ever go in her room? Favorite teacher would have to be Swindle and favorite class is a tie between physics and bio and Chinese. Wbu? That is really cute. Idk she always says hi to me and tries to talk to me but we haven't had a real serious conversation. I don't really go in her room.  Eh, I think my classes are too not serious this year to make a distinction. But I really like Zeitler and Winkelman as teachers, and Biology is the best Why swind l e I stand by my word when I say I dislike Connolly. Swindle is lax but not completely immature. His lessons are short and concise, then we have homework time.  Everyone who has Zeitler loves her but they say she gives too much work. 
Mm everyone has very low standards after hubman. She doesn't give much work at all but she does have high expectations for writing and speaking and things. She moves through very quickly in class and it is stressful, I agree.  What do you even do in her cla s s Was hubman that bad? Apparently Brody is really bad. Lol we read texts and discuss them as a class or in groups. We also have the occasional essay. Sometimes I let her read our texts and we discuss them Jk that was dumb Nah, she was fine but we didn't learn much. Nice person Well at least in my grade Brody got fucked with literally all the students who don't care in my whole grade Plus Haley I think if she had a normal class she would be fine Does she go on rants About weird sh i t Isn't Haley one of the girls who doesn't care though? Not at a l l Connolly goes on the most irrelevant and redundant rants known to man She had almost a . for most of high scho o l They are such a waste of time and everybody gives zero fucks I don't care about her husbands distaste for tapioca pudding  Husband's And she always makes stupid comments like if the teachers here were paid by how intelligent they are, I would be really wealthy My brain has more money out into it than all of you guys will have *put Or like she answers her phone or texts during class and announces what the conversations were about Also her tattoo is so unappealing  She's annoying She has a tattoo? She does sound pretentious A l o t She recently got a tattoo of her husband's name on her leg. Story time 
In th grade this boy named Marcos shaved his legs and the straight boys called him gay and a fag, of course jokingly. Anyway I started crying and I was like, I try to live up to the meaning of born this way and Lady Gaga says 'no matter gay straight or bi' It was absolutely ridiculous Like the boy just shaved his legs because they were too hairy God Your reaction to like everything Was just to cry and say something overly emotional You and Shawn too That's a trashy tat IMO Which straight boys ? ? Omg ok I was  years old and I had just come out. You know what I did when I was  and had just came out? Not that l o l The script is what makes it x more trashy  like Elliot and that group. Yeah okay thank you very much Our situations are all different  What script? Mhm no excuse. Even my trainwreck of an awkward phase was x less bad than you   ) Her tattoo script Okay. Well I'm not like that now so. I know you hate when I talk about it, don't get so frustrated! I'm done though No I know what does it look like is it cursiv e ? Yeah I know, I'm sorry. It is cursive but the letters are crunched together It looks like a square of one word What have you even done all day Hi I took a nap Earlier I watched TV W b u That's great! I was falling asleep on my way to the library which is where I am now. All I have to do is apush, Chinese, and seminar. I went on a walk with the dog and finished math.  My mom has been overly sentimental all day. Lol that sounds like almost the majority of your work How has she been overly sentiment a l I know ( but I'm confident that I'll get it done Idk like she was crying at the dinner table and has been quiet all day Lol you had all day and you start so late Might as well take tomorrow off too. Ah well I do the same thing sometimes What was she crying abo u t I have  words and I need approximately . My mom had me watch my brother today and kept telling me to take a break from math... So that's why I'm starting so late.  Because my brother and I fight all the time I have  pages and I need around .- Last night my mom gave me this Swarovski necklace but it's a women's necklace... Pretty sure no guys wear necklaces anyway, except Jesus people and ghetto rats Pic of necklac e ? I'm not home! But later. Lol it's basically a ring with a heart in the middle of it And she was crying and said that it means I'll always be in her heart Are you gonna wear it o u t Ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA I rarely even wear jewelry Do you do scarves? Oh honey. I am too gay to think it's cold enough in tucson to wear scarves, and not gay enough to do it anyway We should get each other rings. Lol  j k Fuck yeah I finished my paper with  words! Yes, we shall get each other ring pops and then suck each other off. Oh shit nvm I have more to do with my essay nvm What do you have to  d o on the AP seminar website it says  words but rainy and Martha said its actually  I was so scared, so nvm ?? That is very confusing What all do you need to submit for them to gra d e Basically we submit a , word individual essay, then a , word group essay with a group reflection. Then in May we sit down and analyze an article and write about it. I'm just so happy I finished and I'm proud of this essay That's great! Tbh sounds like a very light load for an AP, like you easily could not even  have a class if you were a decent writer I was thinking and Being gay oppresses women. That must be why I chose to be g a y It is a very light load because we basically do nothing in class and have very few assignments. On  we literally spent the hour doing wiki races, and I won two consecutive rounds haha. No I mean not the class Like the whole AP. it's just not a lot of knowledg e   How does being gay oppress women... It's like AP lit but without hellish multiple choi c e Because we tell them the truth about their horrid fashion choices? It was something I saw on tumblr that was so ridiculous it came full circle. I think the idea was that gay guys aren't physically attracted to women and that is shallow so they are oppressing th e m Pretty much and the short essay is much easier. The article is on the topic genius and we write like three paragraphs. Lol what the fuck you could literally say the same about anybody, not just gays I could say the same about straight boys Was it for real? But you can't oppress men, duh.  I think it was, not sure.

I'm sorry it has to be this way but I am breaking up with you because you are in denial and you need to see the light and grow. I can't date people who claim to be cis, because they are so blind. Come back to me when you pronounce your new pronouns to the world (preferably nonbinary ones? ))  #cisfree #nopenis God the humor is just endless with tumb l r People like this make me wish the demise of humanity would come sooner That is absolutely ridiculous. Cis free?! Oh I'm so sorry that I feel comfortable with the body I have What a crime Equality my ass Pic of your comfortable bod y ? You sly bastard That was great 'Twas all a set u p You deserved it ); ) ) Why'd you screenshot the Quran lol I didn't, my phone died in the middle of the snap so I guess it just said that? I d k To use for defamation hmm I'm in such a good mood! Do you have any porn on demand? Yes let me make some one s e c Lol is that a joke I assume you mean find some It was not gonna be a joke But it can be A jo k e No no!!! It shouldn't be Oh I really miss that God the slip was so hot I tried to screen shot but accidentally pressed screen and skipped (( oh well Vi d ? I was already making a vid when you said that haha Yours were sooo good ))) Yours too godda m n Did you come? Y a p So this is what we've come *become How many times have you came this week? We've come to each other lol Only once This is the first time since leaving tucson, or at least since surgery, not su r e I can't wait until we actually come on each other I really need you That is so sad haha, was it worth the wait? Mm around day  I would have said absolutely yes, now, idk. I would wait  days in the interest of better experience but not a week, it's too much. Still, gr orgasm.  I need you too What will we do when I'm back in town? Lets go on a real date Where  t o Too much in terms of the wait or the intensity? ) Yes! I'll pay this time. We can go sneak into Inherent Vice and go out to dinner and then just walk around in the park Ooh there's Bison Witches, Casa Vicente, Govinda's, Rincon Market, Caruso's, Ali Baba Or that one place we went with the rose water Idk it was just so long that my body seemed to settle down for the long haul not expecting any attention so the drive peaked around  days and then crashed. I'll pick up the movie tickets And you the food, ok? Govinda's sounds gre a t Oh no I have a fandango gift card lol so the movie and food would have been no problem Govinda's is one of my favorite restaurants! Also Govinda's is cheap Oh ok that's great! Maybe we could see imitation game instead? Inherent vice is really long to be doing things before and after Plus imitation game is leaving theatres soon Not that I don't want to see inherent vice at some other time soon, I d o ! Ok I'm sorry I always ask but your birthday is the th? Alright ) what day do you want to do it? Remember we have no school . So Sunday is an option Hahaha it's the th. And yours is  th What about doing it  I totally forgot we had the day o f f I just always depend on Facebook to tell me birthdays and it's so upsetting because your birthday isn't there But I knew it was coming up Perhaps! Scouts might be cancelled I'm crossing my fingers  Oh right I forgot about scouts Lol yes I did that cos I hate the notifications I get about random other people and the birthday shit blowing up my feed So I don't post mine so I'm not a hypocrite When is Martha's birthd a y It's in , I think th?  Let me check and hopefully I'm right Oops   My phone does all FB notifications collectively so for birthday messages it will say you have  notifications Or  likes I just get the one it is [person I don't remember much]'s birthday! Notification. But I figured out how to turn it off this week which is great I am the kind of person that needs to take care of notifications so I don't have the app badge So it is irritati n g For some reason I got a notification when Ale posted a selfie? What does badge app mean Like the red number circle  I sometimes get random notifications t o o Omg we need to do another cooking day and make some hummus  I didn't know you could get rid of that... And a clean movie night until the movies end Woww We don't even really ever do things in movie theaters  Unlike almost everyone we kn o w I meant at your house? Lol O h Tranquilo Ohh When are we gonna do the thing with the clean movie night and the others Tequila.  N o We could do it Sunday? Tequila is so good, that's how leo and I bonded We were the only ones who could take multiple straight shots of it And we thought it was delicious It is in your genes And your jeans Lets do it next week? Don't want to over-do it this weekend with an event like th a t Oh yeah this week is formal lol I totally forgot, shit It can be out of my jeans ;) Plus I am not in a condition to have the crazy and awesome sex that we should have if we have a bed and a night to ourselves Yeah that to o   Lol you know if you asked me to restrict myself I could do it It's not like I'm going to be using your chest to hold my body up as I'm going in Or like going crazy with you Like you said, hjs and making out. Keep it slow. Lol in what context did I say that Well also I think the rubbing of the bed against my chest as you bang me back and forth could be problemat i c I asked when we would be able to have sex and then you said we could keep it slow and stick to hjs and making out Lol we should have a night whe r e Oh yeah you're right We spend a shit ton of time working up to it as if we were virgins li k e A night where we just sit there crisscross applesauce and stare at each other. Ye p ! Or that too I actually think that would be really fun I think about that kind of thing sometimes Cuddling and then making out and then light touching and then it would be like  hours before sweet release Really? You think about i t ? Like reenacting the first kiss and everything  I do Now you're making me feel weird No no I think it would be f u n As do I. Taking it slow just makes things more special. Like that one amazing night We didn't really take it slow then though I mean kind  o f Well I'm not saying taking everything slow because obviously we were in a car and we have curfews But just taking the sex slow was still nice Yes the sex itself was slow It was ni c e And perhaps if we take the entire process slow that would be very nice  It was so ni c e When I came that time it felt so different I can remember what it feels like And after was great too Can you describe it? I remember you didn't rub at all once you pulled o u t I can't describe it without sounding cheesy hahah It felt like some greater power was rising inside my body? My chest felt really powerful  What do you mean rub? Idk like I can recall the feeling of blue balls and certain orgasms Like normally you pull out and then jerk yourself for a second. That time you just pulled out and put it on my thigh and came. I don't know what happened that night but it was really special for me too. I cannot describe  How many times have I honestly blue balled you? Not that many I believe l o l I was thinking about that line from Pulp Fiction about silence and then you said it and it was like my life was complete and I could die right then and there Like I was literally thinking the same thing moments before you said it I think once! Go you! Kudos for Aimee You are the best and I'll never get tired of telling you that because you deserve to hear it all the time. )) Yes that pulp fiction mome n t I'll look back at my heyday and remember that night Are you one hour behind?   Unless every night we have becomes like that! I wonder if there are couples like that. Maybe that's what great sex that people talk about is. Still I'll probably remember it as the first time we had that. Yes, it's  Actually it turned  just before I sent #nolie s   I strongly believe that was what passionate sex is. It was indescribable and beyond words. Doing that every night would be terrible! You're not going to appreciate the rare occasions when it does happen. O r Wow so then you really do go to sleep early It's just awesome and you don't get tired and you appreciate it every time because its aweso m e If you're having sex - times a week and it feels like that each time it would be strange It's so funny how we weren't expecting anything different that night It just happened naturally Right? It wasn't even in a nice place, it was normal alley car sex. I really wonder what caused it to be so different. It's not like we had a particularly nice evening before it that was so different from othe r s Lol I remember telling Bella I had the most passionate sex ever and then she asked where and I felt so ashamed  She cannot even say anything lol. It would be different if it was Jen or something Did she say she had had similar se x ? No, she said that their sex is usually rough  He squeezes her boobs and chokes her I just really can't imagine Bella having wild kinky sex Also I don't understand how couples who have been together for years stay virgins for so long Like Carly and Fox Or Jen and Joseph earlier this year (Late ) Well, we have a lot more time together alone you know, like because I drive etc. I think it changes the landsca p e Lol our first time doing any of that stuff was on Bella's bed I really don't get the whole thing about virginity for non religious people outside of the practicality of finding a time and a place Thx for the remind e r Because everybody romanticizes the sacredness of virginity and giving it to the one Like why wouldn't you just have sex? I guess you lose the exploration, but soon enough just normal pump and dump gets old and you explore again, so really you don't miss anythi n g We see that concept everywhere  I guess that is true Are you happy you lost it To me Do you wish you had lost it earlier or wait e d I guess something that makes me sad is that I won't be the only one to have sex with and vice versa  *with you Why does that make you sa d ? And that what we have now is just going to be another person - maybe for both of us - in just a few years  Because I really like you Just because things aren't permanent doesn't make them worthless At all I think it's great what we ha v e As do I, but I think of the nostalgia if I ever see you again Idk it's stupid Just enjoy it now ) it's no use to be sad n o w I'm not sad! It's just so strange to me Lol you want to hear something silly No Jk.  O k Shawn was like when I'm a senior I'm going to go to Japan for my SRP and I'm going to take you with me, I promise you that and I keep my promises. Any other funny Shawn storie s ? And he said I love you after like two weeks of just knowing him! He sent this super long text about how we would take a bullet for me haha He also attached a picture he took of two flamingos making a heart at the San Diego zoo *he would take  For Christmas I had gotten him a candle and I remember I was at this winter break camp and he sent a picture of his feet coming out of bubbles from a bath with the lit candle on the side And I remember I had this sleepover at his house and he was hard, then his mom knocked on the door it was so funny. He was wearing basketball shorts  We both called Demi during that sleepover and left her a voicemail and then we started making out and you could hear slobbery kisses hahahaha We stayed up until  am watching glee. I introduced it to him! Anyway I fell asleep on his bed during one episode and when I woke up he was in the bed with me I remember I was wearing my Boy Scout pants that night but I forget what shirt I was wearing That lady gaga poster in Connolly's room? He gave that to me for Christmas that same night Ok I'm done, sorry No go on if you have mo r e It's just really strange how I used to gush over him and now you're the only person I think about Nah it's okay Omg okay we used to talk about how we would adopt two children One girl and one boy. The girl's name would be Aida Evelyn Nakajima-Jones And the boy would be Charles And that for our wedding we would rent out Times Square hahahahahaah He told me if we got married our last name would be Nakajima-Jones and he would drop Granzier because he hates his dad Okay now I'm completely done  Hahaha rent out Times Square. Charles would have such a strange mix of ethnicities for such a proper name. A Latino-Asian (/ white) boy named Charles I like Aida tho Isn't there an Aida at our school? Like in the grade below you Oh actually Just occurred to me that the kids would not be biological I'm du m b Yes Aida Flores And yeah I was waiting for you to figure that out haha Idk scientific advanceme n t I'll be able to give birth in about  years Out your butt It would be a big poop Pretty sure it would entail test tube babies and a surrogate moth e r I used to think women gave birth out of their belly buttons  I also thought everyone was gay Lol what Explain the second stateme n t I was five and I liked boys so I thought every boy secretly likes boys just like I did Also it would fill me with joy to think about only boys being together and all the girls were single I was such a strange child Once I called  and left the phone behind a shed lol the phone was gone the next week! I thought that Sex was like awkward and embarrassing and no joy And so a couple that wanted kids Would do it like once Locked in a bathroom with their eyes closed Which to be fair is true for some redneck teen mo m s Think about how awkward it would be to be a teacher and seeing your students under People You May Know lol I was told from day one that sex was better than eating cookies My brother's dad drew pictures for me on a Trader Joe's paper bag We were sitting in the trunk when I got the talk ( )  /attachment.jpg Lol I haven't messaged him in like over a month I talk to so many people I never got the talk Not even a little bit of a talk Well it's true he does Not by the other person's volition But sti l l I hated the talk. I was told, there are going to be boys who will want to touch your butt  IF ONLY HE KNEW I WAS ONE OF THOSE BOYS HAHAHAH ) I.... I think he knew Do you want to touch my bu t t No he honestly didn't know. I tried coming out to him in th and he accused me of lying  I actually really want to touch your butt ( E w w That's what got me off during my shower lol Oh I'll send butt pics next time th e n Really! I'm gaping Hah a   Aren't you going to sleep now  Soon ye a(h )  /attachment.JPG HAHhaha A+ Would you fuck a pie Like just to see How it felt Ok I need to describe another tumblr thing to y o u If you love fetus so much why don't you kiss this one! Revolutionary. That sounds slightly appealing...  One thing I do want to try is that glazed donut. 
There is this tumblr for homeless trans people to get couches, and some of them are so fucking useless and not contributions to society it is so pathetic. But that is besides the point. Each post talks about such dumb things, like whether it accommodates wheelchairs and whether people who are sex workers can be safe and work there. One post was a chick bitching about how she lives in Iowa because she had been to big cities and they would not accommodate her hearing disability adequately in thedicaid system. Literally leeching off of the government % Lol you should just do it And say how it is But you CANNOT eat the donut after  o k Can you tell me the blog name? Also what does that have to do with the fact that it's a blog dedicated to getting homeless trans people couches? Seems irrelevant. Maybe we can try that some night and you'll eat the donut  Also that sounds like something I would do, eat the donut. It is about couch surfing not literal couches? Like people offering temporary housing. I will find the link I was thinking about it before you said that And I would eat the don't Donut Tbh I put your dick in my mouth And donut tastes better than dick and all it touched was dick so why n o t Wow I feel stupid. That text makes much more sense now hahaha. But not if you came on it cos it would be sog g y Sex workers wtf I knew you would not get that I just sensed  i t Yeah, you can definitely run your cocaine deals here Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll accidentally bite my dick Like when I'm touching you in afraid I'll make you laugh and then you'll bite it *I'm afraid Have I ever accidentally done tha t ? Not yet ) Btw the balls feels amazing That's one of my favorite things ever What is the best thing I can do with them, I feel like I do not know what to  d o Ok this is going to sound weird but like grasping one ball with your lips And repeating with the other http//www.transhousingnetwork.com It's more the have couch that are funny but also some others Ok I can do that! Anything els e ? I like what you do with the nipples lol Necking also feels nice זית Oliv e ? !כן Why oliv e ? It's just a cute word idk Lol ok Zayyit What does it feel like wh e n Rotze is difficult for me to say I take body shots off you H m m Well do you mean how I feel sexually or physically or emotionally? I meant physically, but all  are acceptable And now desir e d How desired? I desire an explanation on all  fron t s Physically it feels like somebody is slightly tickling me haha Sexually it feels like a lack thereof, even thought it's pretty much the point of body shots.  Emotionally I feel like somebody is taking not even a shot's worth of alcohol off of my stomach and that I should not be condoning this wild behavior. Jk about the last one. I don't feel anything. I like taking them off of you rather than anybody else or having anybody take them off of me That's more fun for me You know the seniors were playing spin the bottle (I and few others stayed out) and I was thinking how weird it was and how we as a group would never do th a t That game only works with strangers otherwise what's the point See but it was just the seniors with no one else Literally just people from my grade They are so sexually frustrated lol I think all of them just need to be laid mo r e Well didn't people go off for a threesome anyway Did that end up happening Lol that was a way different party With a totally separate group of peop l e Mashehu Remember in the room with reyna e t c What happened? When we were talking in jest about having an orgy I think it would be really funny if one of our smaller parties turned into a bisexual free for all Like everyone is into everyone for one night likely due to drug consumpti o n That would be an interesting way for the night to unfold  You're getting me excited Lo l ? Well because it sounds somewhat appealing I suppose in the moment. I think it would be incredibly awkward in the morning But we would be legen d s I'll never forget Diviya and Bella making out Haha I had forgotten about th a t And then after they did that they made plans to go shopping together Did they go? Did Veris kno w ? I think so! I don't think Veris would ca r e He didn't know haha I think he would find it hot, secret l y Didn't he once say it was boner time or something? Lol yes He was so wast e d I don't find lesbians hot I've tried watching lesbian porn and I just don't like it
 neither I think it is gross Like a total turno f f It doesn't seem like scissoring achieves much clit is such a gross word. What shall I call it instead The knob Piggle wiggl e r Do you ever rub your knob against your pants? Or your boxers? Mm not really the anatomy does not work o u t I was reading about people with vaginas who do Apparently it's a thing I read that too and I don't get how they do it People with vagina s I subconsciously did that and then I consciously noticed it and then left it Lol but I thought yours was bigger than most I remember you told me it would become like a little pinky and then you could use it for anal I think I was unlucky in that respect. Actually I consider it lucky I don't want a gross elongated knob. I think in most it grows to be like -.  i n Wouldn't that hurt though But mine is definitely not more than  cm And it would hurt me for su r e Don't you ever just look at yourself down there I do Lol from time to ti m e That's how I figured out I still had stitches lol How could you not look I mean da m n At first I thought you were saying that about yourself lol But really I don't find my penis good-looking In comparison to others it puts mine to shame and makes me feel ashamed  Your penis is definitely far above average in looks Especially the head But also the sha f t I really like my butt this week I've been obsessed with butts in general Nice ones though, not cottage cheese. You should study middle eastern but t s I'll do that this weekend ;) Or maybe through some snapchats I think mine is somewhat cottage cheese ((( I am going to work out sometime and get a nicer o n e .... You have such a nice ass I really just like looking at it This is embarrassing But I'm getting hard now ( Haha h a It's really not difficult to turn guys on And for that I am thankful It's so cute And also really flattering When I go to touch and you are hard even before I have done much And your dick is so thick it feels really nice in my ha n d Or like when I'm wet before we've even started doing anything  I really enjoy watching movies with our hands down each other's boxers
 too But my mind is on you really and not so much the mov i e At least we go back to the parts we missed like with Say Anything hahah Goodness I really just want to be with you right now When we have the movie night Can you wear sweatpants Or just wear them more in general lol when we go out It is so h o t in public?! And sure! I love sweatpants. Dick outlines in sweatpants look so good I like when you wear tight boxers Yeah in public! Well not to like a nice place but if we are just hanging why not? Lots of people wear sweatpants What about briefs? What is idea lol Ideal I like it when you wear tight boxer briefs, but also boxers are cool too w dick slips And how you can have a boner sticking a mile out in boxer s   When I wore baby underwear my butt looked so nice and my boner just flung right out I'll wear sweatpants to the next event we have! Boner flinging   < Dick slips you know they're so annoying because when I use the urinal to go pee my dick can't even fit through them I earlier meant what underwear do you like best on  m e It's too big ( ) I have to move around just to get it through when I'm hard Which is quite often Oh! I'll send a pic Lol I know, I hope it doesn't hurt when I'm trying to get them out of your jeans Yes s(s )  /attachment.JPG Lol nothing left to the imagination the r(e )  /attachment.JPG Jk. But I like those tight and short boxer briefs you wear I love when you're just walking around in them it's such a turn on  Like these minus the print ( )  /attachment.JPG Oh the pink ones? Like the American eagle one s ? You have pink boxers?! Yeah like hot pi n k You must show me next time I do not wear them very often because they are really nice so I don't want to wear them out Haha  o k Lol oh yeah better not get any semen on them So I guess never mind  Hahaha Ok I am going to sleep, but I hope you have a nice jerk off session if you so wi s h You just want pictures don't you And you should send a pic of the results if you do so Read my mind bi s h I CALLED IT Good night habibi bibti bibi Good nigh t   Bibi Netanyahu ( )  /attachment.JPG ( )  /attachment.jpeg Who a(a )  /attachment.jpeg fog this morning. We can't see anything! ( )  /attachment.JPG I just think it's really pretty. I'm done though. It is really pretty. You should snap some pics from the school if there is fog there Also, you are totally gonna be late, n o ? Yes! I'll do that Lol yeah... But that's nothing new. Billings has started saying it's nice to have you in class today because I rarely ever see her. I just always miss first period. Is it somewhat intentional I mean really is not that difficult to leave a couple minutes earlier Never got how people are late every damn d a y Ok well this morning my grandpa got home late from taking Richie to school It's only intentional sometimes and I mean it's not like she's lecturing because we do independent study With my mom back though I don't think I will be late  Why are you driving with Jay? ! ? Just to hang out bc we don't have much homework now that seminar is over What's up How was your day My day was pretty alright! The bad news is that I have a whole lot of coverings still on my chest for at least  weeks so you can't see much and what you can is all bruised  And I had corn ice cream But The sweater looks gr ,   ,   For some reason my phone is being weird? It says you are texting me from your phone now instead of email address Rent is great I will watch it again soon To be fair he has a point I could not stop if I wanted Unless I was with a roommate / with no Internet connecti o n Is it ok now? The last text where you said it should be from phone was from email and this one is from pho n e Well he has a point but that's after long term use, no? Can you tell me if it's working? Is it from my number Lol I could stop whenever I want. It is from your nimb e r I don't really watch it. I usually just look at the collection I have of you. Mm idk I was hooked from the first time Hahaha well that somewhat counts as porn t o o Okay cool! I don't consider it porn since I get the same thing in person hahah. Although I guess I do take time to admire I feel like if I did that in person you would be weirded out, also I you're in somewhat of a hurry ,   ,   That video got provocative pretty quickly lol Are you working? ,   ,   Hey The pictures from the book are so beautiful and simple and minimalistic, I love it. I've always found handkerchief culture fascinating Also I think in this day and age there will never be an intellectual setting where people don't take offense to something  How was your day ( )  /attachment.PNG Wow!! Congratulations!! You know, that is a HUGE deal for colleges!! And it probably means a free ride to U of A I think it is so cool, those pics and descriptions I find the 's/'s gay culture fascinatin g   I was reaaaaaally surprised to receive that email, but yeah, I think I'll apply. Yes! The men were so attractive Also the Lavender scare, that's interesting to me. But you know when you write a paper about something and it exhausts your curiosity for the topic? It's not even a hard application! Just put in your future personal statement, and fill some forms. Easy peasy Yeah... I have had that happen many tim e s Are you speaking from experience w the national merit applications? The email says reg deadline is  but the reg website says June...  Aimee! Today Reyna and Diviya and I were talking about our lives and relationships, and I had mentioned that you weren't one to really express how you feel And Reyna and Diviya were telling me all of these things that you told them about me lol But they were very nice, caring comments  Like what? I do not recall anything specific haha Btw! The amherst fly in form Is so funny It begins with an alcohol policy The policy says that the college-sponsored parties may have alcohol but underage will not be allowed but that in non-college sponsored events it is not their problem We encourage you to seek non-alcoholic beverages, which shall be equally accessible if you do attend a party  Then they have the important phone numbers and signatures part. The whole form is alcohol and signatur e s Hi sorry I just got home from a scout thing Hahahahaha I love how that is their biggest liability rather than something like abuse We encourage you to seek Ummmm I want to watch Her again It was so goddamn prett y   Things like you think I'm attractive, you really like me, I make you laugh, you enjoy being around me, you don't know how to make me happy or express these feelings to me And I mean while I already know these things (who doesn't think them about me?) it's nice to hear Makes me feel happy Really? Is it THAAAT pretty or is it just Joaquin Phoenix's eyes? I had my mom let me leave early from scouts bc Boy Scout boy was there and I was overcome by this this state of depression for no reason and I was also tired I really love the colors. But also his eyes. And Scarlett's voice, and how romantic it all is (even if in a creepy way) ; ( What happened to him? I've been watching house of cards at it is damn good An d * Maybe I'll watch Her this week. Maybe I'll watch her this week... ;) You know, over spring break I watched  movies! 😱 also, there is this amazing website I found. Highly recommend you check it out http//whatisonnetflix.com Everyone is watching that show too. It's probably time for me to get back into tv shows. He isn't ASPL anymore and he can't go to an event without his parents lol. Who is she? Yes haha I know that website I like movies more and I feel a bit guilty because I think TV is lesser but in terms of relevant and specific social commentary to today.. It's so good Like not even the meetings? ,   ,   Well, I like the website haha. I'm going to use it from now on.  With tv shows I feel obligated to continue watching and then if I don't finish a season I feel like a failure. But yeah, I totally agree. Also after a few seasons the show usually gets sloppy and repetitive. Can you believe glee is over! No idea haha, I didn't ask about the technicalities  Down Home Town - ELO Poker - ELO I feel that way about glee I feel obligated to go back and finish it some day Kind of like how you have to listen to the new lady gaga albums There is this restaurant I want to go to called the parish You like those two song s ? Maybe we should have a glee marathon day and spend all day with a bunch of snacks and shit I left off in New York ( Or we could start from season  lol I looked at the parish menu and holy shit it looks so good The big hippie burger and the fries If I could eat shellfish I would enjoy it a lot more Also live music every ! It is soooooo long though! Literally we would need a full day per season, they are each like  hou r s Yes I love those two songs. Actually, the whole Face the Music album is great. 'Waterfall' I watched how to marry a millionaire, and I loved  i t Who cares lol? Let's do it We should go on a Frida y ! I WANT TO SEE THAT But not for the next two s lol I have wo r k is Marilyn a good actress Okay haha let me know when And the  after that I am busy too with a show at school Maybe lets not go on a  It was my first Marilyn movie and I must say that She didn't shine because she wasn't the lead She was fine, nothing really special Beautiful of course But she was dominated by Lauren Bacall Who was brilliant I think it wasn't her acting but the character was weak I just wanna try southern fo o d You know what, I'm going to watch it right now lol. I don't have much homework left to do. Lauren Bacall was in Howl's Moving Castle! She only died last year I vaguely remember that she died and I had only vaguely heard of her It was damn funny And sooo stereoty p y My friend who lives in Austin tells me the Texx food from the street carts are to die for  Did you ever see that SJW thing I sent last night The black thing? It was fucked up on all sides  Mm I just wish I had the ability to eat out more and have more variety I love trying new fo o d No no, not the black thing http//godshaves.us/post//danguy-sjws-radfems-and-neo-nazis-getting I wish I had more money to try new food lol We're going to Zemam's next, yeah? Ohhhh yes I did read those Same Yeah sure The people can't speak Spanish one was the worst IMO like, then white people can't even accommodate other, literally it would be oppressive if no white people spoke Spanish in this country Sí señor? ¿ ? I thought all of the comments were ignorant, but the one that stood out to me the most was the straight and white teeth. Sí mijito Ya se I feel offended that people in other countries want to learn English... It's rather nauseating I think many of them are parodies Or really smart people who use this to bring down the SJW cause intentionally Or maybe people are just that ridiculous Or maybe it's a small cadre of mentally ill bitch e s Were you the one who told me about the person who said the police dispatcher should not use pronouns when addressing victims? You'd be surprised how many rants these people post. They just don't get much attention but they are very persistent about it. Anyway I'm going to assume it was you. So I told Annika about that and she was totally on the side of the person and said that we need to stop using pronouns altogether because it's segregation. Yeah I think it was me How is that segregati o n You're explicitly categorizing people based on the one word and are thus associating them with whatever preset connotations come with the use of the pronoun Just by using that one word over the phone The mango carrot juice bar sounds aweso m e Excuse me ma'am Ma'am what is your emergency Oh I thought she meant At all, like in society  No more pronouns peri o d She is also for that... Both her and Aaron Is aaron one of these types to o ? Yeah I mean he's friends with Panteha We don't get any work done in physics because we are always arguing about shit Annika says and I always look like some insensitive asshole Nightrider - ELO so thaaaaats what you're doing Thank you It's been forever 
 One thing I do agree with And this is not over the phone but in person  If someone is pretty androgynous, and you are a cashier or something, don't make a decision either way and say sir or ma'am, and don't ask them their pronouns, just the subject altogether  I'm glad you like ELO haha. I only really like Livin Thing and Mr Blue Sky. Why did you look into them Just avoid the subject   * Of course one should never assume when it's not that obvious, but I think if somebody is overtly displaying a female/male exterior then it's not wrong of me to use the presumed pronoun, until I'm told otherwise. Aaron gave me his Face The Music vinyl and I've been listening to ELO ever since So basically a week lol Do you have clothes on yet No no no of course, I agree. Just like if someone is clearly female body but is obviously trying to look masculine don't ma'am Or vice ver s a ) Maybe it's shower time for me But I just... I need help I forgot how to take off my clothes What comes off first? Ask your mom   ) Great idea! First the soc k s Oh so just my socks Okay Then the h a t What if I'm wearing a headscarf?

Like civ  o m f #MacProbz If I wanted to play games I would end up breaking my trackpad All is available on there lol, I use a trackpad only Except like First person shoote r s I thought we were doing  anyway? Oh, I thought .  O k Sure, but the Mac trackpad is very fragile I recently got mine fixed because it sunk in from clicking too hard Oh, that's strange for such an expensive laptop godda m n Macs are such a joke! Does your laptop have a cd thi n g You can tap it and it dents lol The older models were much more sturdy No 😭😭😭 it cost more money than the one with the CD player too!!!!!!! Isn't that true for everythi n g All for fucking retina display I would never buy a Mac if I wasn't Rick Rich.. Like if I had the $ to keep a real computer at home I might buy one but otherwi s e Well it wasn't even a financial burden for us, like we were perfectly capable of paying it off. Honestly it was all for the brand name Yeah but to me it is inferi o r Like that's why we got it I would need a better, real computer at home to have serious applications Yeah, I think that's why all do The people who use it for spotify, tumblr and Netflix have few proble m s I think the desktop macs are pretty cool though and they come with pages and numbers and Keynote and iMovie and GarageBand. Mine only has the last two. I downloaded league of legends once but it was too difficult to play with the trackpad Yeah no those are functiona l   My computer is only used for spotify and FB and Netflix and email Still overpriced but at least not lacking in ability One legit argument is that Mac is lighter and has better battery li f e They are functional and sleek, I really like the desktop ones. The battery is impressive Compared to a lot of windows computers http//www.slate.com/articles/life/dear_prudence///dear_prudence_my_sister_slept_with_her_high_school_teacher_then_married.html I only thought the first one was interesting Yeah I think it's difficult I think it really depends on context which we aren't given enough of And really the sex offenders list shouldn't be for things like this. It is a lifetime blacklist. The guy doesn't deserve it Ok I will be down in ...ish Depends on traffic bb i am hurr ,   ,   🎈🐢 Good night Aimee, I had the best time! Sweet dreams https//vimeo.com/ http//m.youtube.com/watch?v=HzikCUPP x w Earthling - Jobrianth One never knows when the homosexual is about I can't believe this was shown in schools. It's so dehumanizing. All I can say is that I'm glad this stigma is not as present anymore. I'll watch the Vimeo one soon There's an article to go with the vimeo if you want it the video is about a gay gang called check it in  D C You should send it! I thought you were just going to haha Are you working tonight? Or did you work today? http//thinkprogress.org/culture/////started-bottom-black-lgbt-gang-america-surviving-fashion/ Worked today. Will work tomorrow night but not tonig h t Oh okay Wh y ? Just wondering Interesting specialization, the fashion industry! Like of all causes. Or things to do in general You know, the gays and all What's  u p Yes, the gays and all! When I was really into art and I was drawing all the time I wanted to be a fashion designer. I have these really shitty designs in my sketchbook. ( I was going to suggest we go out again but I didn't want to be too annoying and pushy I am finishing up dinner. And you? How was your day? I still want to be a fashion designing Brock star gaga P Oh no, that would have been great, you should have My day was fine, I got a lot done I had  pages of cues to go through at the start of the day and now only  so I consider that progre s s So then do you want to go out tonight? It's too late now-- I need to book travel plans tonight to send to amherst, unfortunately, and that will take time  ( Ughhhhhhhhhh okay haha That is a lot of cues, holy damn. Do you think you'll be ready by the time we see the show? P Did you know (probably not) that Nathaniel asked Diviya to prom today in front of the entire school over the speaker  And then patty called her down and Diviya said yes I realized this morning that I actually am only going on on Sunday. And anyway it only took  hours to do that, I will finish tomorrow before the evening. It's only  or so cues, many of the pages don't have a n y So she's been in this prom mood ever since Yes she texted me lol God that is something amanda would allow only if Diviya was involved ha h a What do the travel plans consist of? Is it basically your itinerary or is it like tax stuff? Well I am going Sunday's *sunday! I think Nathaniel had this master plan the whole time and that's why he joined prom committee hahaha. Amanda probably didn't know  they need a confirmation that I have a hotel, train etc.  Awwww fuck Then don't try to go out with me afterwards because I will be all torn up Haha h a Omg I didn't get any of these messages until now I didn't get that Jew dinner one either Train!! Is this going to be your first time on a train? Hahaha actually it's jen's birthday night so we are having a sleepover  But I'll make sure to see you before we leave I'm watching this startling documentary about / that is very physics based Do you ever worry about college ruining you? Haha no I have traveled in a train quite a bit over my life- most recently from LA to tucson What is it called? No not really. College ruining me? I don't understa n d
It is called  In Plane Site. Zayna suggested it to me and I was expecting something about racism and Islam but nooo. It's pretty much government secrets and conspiracy theories and the truth; maybe the government is behind it? Not very compelling evidence but it's interesting.  Yes, like turn you into a pretentious asshole. Or that you will succumb to hard liquor and drugs Or you'll drop out I try to avoid those conspiracy type things, it's all nonsense. Not surprised Zayna should enjoy it No I am not worried of that lol I am worried my grades won't be high enough   It's neither truth nor good fiction so I don't waste my time with it.  But if you like it in the same way I like honey boo boo that's alright  Just don't get it into your he a d It was SUCH a waste of time. The man basically said that it was a plot by the U.S. to start the war on terror and get money.  Not high enough to get into med school? Whaat I didnt know you knew honey boo boo I thought you weren't into the reality tv show stuff Well yes, for med school. But the implicit fear is that I won't be a strong student there- below average. I don't know that I could stomach it.  Not anymore really but from time to time The first all nighter I ever pulled I watched toddlers in tiaras all night Given, I was like  or  I am watching fight club and it isn't what I expect e d I really think basis places this false mentality into our heads that we are better than everyone else and that we are more intelligent than everyone else. That's a legitimate concern for you to not feel like you will stand out Well, when I get into the same school Larissa does. . . That's more respectable than me pulling all nighters to watch Keeping up w Kardashians last year... Literally did no hw at all I would come home, watch the show, sleep, wake up, repeat. I'm watching Gentlemen Prefer Blondes ) All about eve turned out to be gripping But kinda long Tell me how that  i s I wonder where Madeline Ness is going... She is the biggest cheater I know. I'll watch that next! Even though I have made many commitments to watch other movies hahah Why isn't fight club what you expected? It's about a guy who goes to support groups so far... Eh it doesn't have to be at the top of your list, just somewhere It is like showgirls if showgirls was good, PG, and took place in  in N Y C Ah, starting out with a character flaw. I always imagined it was about some club seeping with testosterone where strong men fight or something.  Is like water for chocolate on your list Right that is what I thought. He goes to support groups for things he doesn't have because he has insomnia and it helps him to open up I'll ad d   Are you coming to the school at all this week? How far in are you? You know, I think Monroe's voice is annoying lol. Also she calls her fiancé daddy and it gets irritating really fast   Apparently it was a Broadway musical before the movie I am reading some critical analysis of all about eve and they say it is a bit ridiculous Yes I'll be in on  I am like  min into fight club Her voice is sooo annoying she is like the prototypical dumb blon d e Question why do you think we enjoy watching movies from the s? What do you think it means psychologically I've been thinking about this for a while  ? Like I don't like a lot of the perceptions and ignorance of the time but I wish I lived then You know? I think the older movies are closer to our reality, they don't rely on things so out there like most of the movies these da y s Life seemed very simple Sure but it is interesting anthropologically to be able to step into that time in a completely authentic way  And I don't think we judge them that way- that they are ignorant or whatever. It isn't even like theatre, that someone is making a choice to retain the ignorance written in another time.  I find myself talking differently after watching these films And it is funny to hear the high society american accent that is dead tod a y Fuck, I want to take a film culture and evolution of film class sooooo bad. That's going to be a lot of fun.  I find myself talking and acting differently after certain films too. Another thing, I love hearing references to gender dynamics in older films hahah. Very strong in Rear Window.  I feel like their speech is really proper and it's how I aspire to be Lol I was reading the analysis of all about Eve as I said, and despite nothing to actually suggest it, they all assume Eve is a lesbian because she uses guys and is ambitious It's fun n y There are a bunch of articles about frozen and how it's all about a pro-lesbian agenda since there is no Prince, and she is fiercely independent. Do you know any old gay movies You are so cute! Do you know when obesity started to become a big problem The boys in the band! In fact though There is a great and famous book called the celluloid closet, by Vito Russo And it is about gay representation in film, it is from the 's so yeah Yes I have seen those dumb things about frozen Obesity has always been a big problem. (Pun) I would say  though, idk I think it was around then ( )  /attachment.jpeg Good nig h t Oh yeah, you showed me Boys in the band last night. I'll add that one to my list too.  ( Okay well, goodnight. If I could take a class in gay history I would do  i t You'll probably have the opportunity to attend some gay history seminar or lecture ( )  /attachment.jpeg The common waxbill Have a good day, hamudi 😘😘😘 Where is that bird from Today I went to utterback middle achool  Scho o l The bird is native to sub-saharan Africa Why'd you go there?? ATC did a teaching follow up there today It was a bit scary The school cop literally said it's been a good day, haven't had any arrests yet I ended up not having work tonight so what's up w y o u I was going to ask you the same! We can do something if you want but I want to do a bit of hw OK. How long would that ta k e Well I meant like while we were out but I can work before then? I'll let you know if that's not a viable option though No that's fine  What's the plan http//i.imgur.com/hrsIgl.gi f v You mean what are we doing or what time? Both I want you to make the plan tonig h t Can we egg the school? Totes Hey when you have the opportunity  If you could go through your watch list and count how many have a female protagonist, doesn't have to be now, or soon, that would be co o l Okay well when you pick me up I'll give you the address to where we are going I'll say  Of course! May I ask why? Haha Idk, I realized that it is a huge underrepresentation (.% of movies I watched have female leads). I was curious if that degree of skew was a result of my movie choice or the industry in general  K! ,   ,   Oh yeah that really bothered me, especially around the whole family. My favorite scene was when the mom got on the cousins' ass though.   ,   Hey As a traffic study lol. What is the concluded political incentive behind the closing? Overall it just seems like a huge inconvenience even if you want to use it as a political advantage Did Shirley MacLaine even write risqué novels What were some criticisms of your presentation I heard Bryce's was great I think the point was to piss the mayor off because he did something to upset mr. Christie? Yeah it's pretty weak, idk.  But the fact that there are emails supporting this is the clincher  No idea. there was a reference to it in world goes round too. Why do you ask? Well basically that it was lacking in direction (tru e ) Hey sorry b It was kinda strange bc when you came up Nathaniel and I just came back from talking about how Diviya broke up w him and he almost cried Yeah the article didn't provide much context and it kept wavering between a traffic experiment and then not a traffic experiment and it was hard to follow But then yes, the emails Because each time I listen to Arthur in Afternoon and I don't get the reference because I don't think it's what she's widely known for What is your conclusion for your SRP? You look so happy Oh shit really That was unexpected God that was an unlucky moment to walk in No, no. They said it was a traffic experiment as cover That was a lie Eh there isn't really a conclusion. Shit's fuck e d Diviya and Nate were both going to go to Oregon and when Nate was asking for a letter of rec Mathews asked if they were together. So nate said yes and then Mathews told him that he had to notify the camp about this. Diviya got upset and now refuses to go She also broke up with him and said she would continue things in the summer Her rationale is that the label creates complications But nate doesn't understand this and thinks it's very irrational and he was super pissed off, which I understand I've started watching heartbeats and its terribly tedious That's such a Diviya thing to do (, it is irrational. I hope he can weather this, and they end up back together in the summer. Cos this was a real fuck up on her part. I keep remembering that I'm doing the end of year project. It seems unreal to be going back to school for a whole week at this point. I feel like I graduated long ago  What don't you like about  i t He refused to just be friends with her because it's either all or nothing. She said she's willing to start things back up in June, even though she is leaving for two months. Hahah you know that you don't have to show up for projects if you don't want to On my last day of APs we should celebrate And go eat somewhere cool And maybe do a movie sleepover Well like a lot of the scenes that are supposed to be artistic are too abundant that it just annoys me I'm still going to finish it When you come back to the school for meetings and stuff do you feel like a graduate? Would it be just us then? Or us and Diviya and Reyna or something if not Nate for a movie Not even a graduate, just detached Lol I'm gonna do it, not like I have ANYTHING better to do... Like really.   ,   We can do one with just us or we can invite Reyna and James. Hopefully Diviya and nate work things out. They were both texting me their problems / these situations frustrate me and I don't think it's my place Ummmm.....rcedes can we do something a little more... Black? Kurt I agree, we do an awful lot of show tunes  Rachel it's Glee club, not crunk club ( )  /attachment.PNG Canada needs some Ontario enhancement  Omg james lol That would be hilarious Season  is so much wittier and better in terms of character development Realistic that teens are bitches. Unrealistic that schuester is so fucking immature.  Still, Blaine prevails.  Anyway good night and good luck as studying continu e s OKAY AIMEE HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!!! ❤️💕😘😊🌝🌙🌺💞💗 Eres great lol A FUCKING MOUSE JUST RAN PAST ME AND BRUSHED MY FOOT IM GOING TO DIE IVE BEEN INFECTED OH WOE IS ME Hahahah omg not even  
I ate this off brand otter pop and it tasted like garlic and then the second one tasted like medicine and then I realized the knives I had used to cut them open weren't clean... I'm so dumb, it took like  minutes for that to occur to m e . Hahah what is most surprising is that it made the entire otter pop taste like whatever you used the knife to cut earlier. Anyway, I need to die in quarantine because I'm going to die from that fucking rat ohhhhhh.  What are you up to today? Have you thought about how you want to decorate your cap? Guess Diviya and Nate are back together lol Oh no, I gave up after a couple licks and threw two of them o u t Also heartbeats was literally the way you explained it. There were some pretty scenes with cool lighting and the music and acting were cool but overall, the story was shit Like the party the Greek god threw Do you like Amy Winehouse? Why the rat fear?? Really don't get it Yeah, I'm doing that from -. Haven't thought about it yet... How predictable. Hopefully it won't be like V, where she did this and so they proceeded to really break up due to trust issues soon after Greek god party? Yes I love her. Do you? I remember where I was when I heard she die d(. )  /attachment.jpeg They're so vile and repulsive ugh. They have always freaked me out as a child. Maybe put some Ivy leaves on it, since that would be most appropriate ;) Ok but I doubt V really even liked her. I don't remember why they broke up exactly but her relationship w Nate is actually going places. Yes, the main dude reminds me of a Greek god, especially after they had all of those flashes of the statues and stuff I doubt she liked him I think he liked h e r That scene where he throws a party and they're all dancing. I thought that was beautiful Yessss I love her too. I've been listening to her all of yesterday and today. Santana's version of Valerie is better tho You should listen to Sleepless Night by Yoko Ono Also Let Count the Ways by her too Hi Sorry I was at the senior thing, just got back Santana really did kill that song I will check out the yoko And that rat is terrifyi n g Hey, how'd it go? What did you do with your cap? That's not our rat hahah. Just the image that I associate with rodents in general. I just saw American Sniper That was such a disgrace I just put some brown paper on top Lol And some brown ribbon on the sides Most put wildcats related stuff Why didn't you like it Where are you now? Nice pho t o Well it is symbolic of something so I can't say you aren't creative lol Yeah there were a bunch of caps and shirtless people on snapchat stories Eric is going to UPenn #ivybu d s I just went for a run and then I sat on some bleachers for half an hour So that will make for a total of  Ivy peop l e I had the entire middle school field to myself I didn't like the way Iraqi life was portrayed and how they all had affiliations with terrorism. And I think it was overall a disturbing movie lol yes. The senior boys have no modesty. I saw so much unnecessary dick outline. They just kept pulling their pants up to extrem e s And I hated his motive for joining the war. I think it is a pathetic excuse for an American hero Which middle school Sure but that is the point It's a harsh criticism And it portrays the war zones realistically. It isn't meant to be a portrait of the country as a whole These areas are abandoned except for terrorists Anyone who wants to keep their life and isn't affiliated with terror usually moves away But yeah the guy is supposed to be seen as an average guy driven to be a psycho due to war Average military guy Because that is what the average military guy motive is. He ISNT a hero and that is the poi n t Who are the other  Ivy people and what schools? 
True, but there was still that scene where a child is contemplating whether or no he should pick up the weapon and Kyle also contemplates killing him. Well from what I know about Clint Eastwood (in other war related films and conservative) and based on the ending of American Sniper I assumed that it wasn't a criticism, but that it was lauding Kyle for turning his life around and being a hero, which I found disgusting. The school across the street. It was relaxing to listen to music and watch the sun set haha. I don't get what is objectionable in that scene? He doesn't want to kill the kid at all, but once the kid is about to kill his teammates Kyle has to pull the trigger and is scarred by that. Holly- Cornell Parthib- Yale Eric- UPenn  Oh, what are you listening to In glee when they actually perform valerie it is ruined because they make it a dance showcase- detracting from vocals. Wtf. It's at sectional s   No, I'm saying that's how the Iraqis are portrayed. All of them - including the children - are terrorists to some extent.  Weren't you upset or something because everyone was surprised you were going to an Ivy League? Like everyone didn't think you were that smart? I listened to Amy Winehouse, some show tunes, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono Also Lily Allen Because that's the zone they are in.. Innocent people don't stay in war zon e s I'm on episode  I think! But I did a lot of reading today. I started The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut and some book about a Latina girl in high school Well yes, I understand now I think if you are looking for objectionable things you will find them in all media. But I think you missed the mark on the message here No one was surprised really... Only surprised that someone is going out of state after hearing u of a and asu all day Which of the books did you prefer l o l Well I also got the general message but I was using that specific instance as an example Is that literally where almost everyone is going? It's so fucked up because I remember years ago your grade wanted to get out and they all had their top colleges.  I have to sign up for the ACT right now ughhhhhh And then I have to take SAT subject tests but it keeps telling me there are no available dates?? There are some in June though. Idk what the problem is I actually love Vonnegut. This Latina book is in diary format. The annoying kind though Lol Idk if you heard about that kid other students were paying to take their SAT a few years ago  Last year I used to torture myself with YouTube videos parents made for their Harvard bound child Here it is http//www.nbcnews.com/id//ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/students-arrested-sat-cheating-scheme/ Fuck this line though Scores didn't match up with GPAs  Out of state  Sienna Helena Eric Holly Dominique Elizabeth Sarah Hannah Xochi Larissa Erica Parthib Steven Jacob G. Cerelia Alex  Robert Charlotte Miles So over / going out of state, and I might have missed a few people. Not too shabby I thi n k How did you possibly assemble this list lol I actually want to know Please tell me the school doesn't post who is going where ( Most off the top of my head and then I looked in yearbook. I just talked with a lot of people and they mentioned a lot of other people.  they do at graduatio n   The guy the friends are after in Heartbeats looks like the male version of lords  *lorde But some I am not sure about so it could be a few more Why do you love Vonnegut I like him too Sign up for it in the fall if you can't June Eh it happens all the time, SAT cheating  Yeah fuck that. Plenty of great GPA shit scores (Helena) and bad GPA great scores (Alex) The black haired one? He is sooooo cu t e The black haired guy was super cute! Great outfits for all the characters, especially the sweaters/jackets. The other guy though http//www.imdb.com/media/rm/tt# His futurist perspectives on the individual and the human condition and society in general are particularly interesting.  lol Martha told me she went back and changed answers for her SAT Aint that some crazy shit Why do you like Vonnegut What have you read? It's just really sad that kids were willing to pay thousands of dollars for an SAT score. I think dystopias are fun. I read only the short story Harrison Bergeron.  Wow we should tell on her. Why is that sad ?   Ah yes! Harrison Bergeron is some good shit Lol then we'd also have to tell on a lot more students Well that these tests mean so much to us and to colleges when they measure nothing It's sad how dependent we are on them Also I think that their score should just be their score and that they should make the best out of whatever college they get into  Ah yes, Harrison Bergeron is some good shit. Quoth Herr Sergio Mm I don't think they measure nothing. like at all.  I think they measure some kind of ability. Almost never are we surprised at someone's scores.  
It is an equalizer. If you go to a shit school and get a good GPA despite not knowing anything, SAT exposes that. If you go to basis and have a crappy GPA but are actually pretty smart, it's just hard at basis, sat exposes that too. 
Sure that's what they should do, but they want the prestige of a famous school to carry them to the business job they would have been qualified for anyway because they have connections, but needed the degree (that they cheated for) to be hired for.  Sunday ,  They are doing it because they know they aren't smart but they need the name brand for the career they have planned That's what happens when careers that don't require superior knowledge require superior degree s  
I think about the SAT in the opposite way because ultimately it comes down to knowing your algebra  and some vocabulary words. I don't necessarily think it has much to do with intelligence or how smart you are except for the math portion of the test. It all depends on exposure, where the basis kids might do better because of the math and language arts emphasis. I say that because many basis kids just don't even study for it and do fine compared to the many tucson high kids I've met.  
Okay but where does one draw the line then? If we have all these constructs that affect college acceptance (grades, standardized testing, etc.) and people are cheating on everything then who is to say they will effective in their desired field? I just don't support it  And I don't think you should try to rationalize that behavior I think in theory it doesn't come down to ability (not saying intelligence. Ability is more knowledge-based). But in practice, when most people don't study, it does.  It's not a large percentage that do this I just don't get the SAT/ACT hate. I think they are VERY representative of what is trying to be measured -- college preparedness.  People aren't cheating on everything. I am rationalizing the ideology of the group that cheats on SAT. Or the most valid ideology of the group. The SAT only directly measures those things you listed but 
Really it's a matter of memory recall, critical thinking, and reading and writing ability and practice. Which is all very important for college. So in theory someone who really doesn't know shit could learn the specific required skills. But if you don't know shit you probably won't care to practice. For the vast majority of test takers it exposes the pre-existing knowledge and skills because they don't study (or don't study effectively). I think it is popular to criticize the test but it usually just confirms what everyone who really knows the test-taker already knows about their ability.  I mean yes in theory the test has major issues but in practice it really doesn ' t
Is that why you believe that SAT prep and retaking it won't significantly improve scores? You're right though. My only problem is about the people who just haven't been exposed to much and get low scores. It's a bit unfair that a shitty upbringing and education never gives them the opportunity to get accepted to a good college where they can develop those skills.  Connolly gave this inspiring speech on  about happiness. Basically from day one it was implied she would be a sociologist. Got good grades, got into a good college, got started on a very elite doctorate program. 
If they have such shitty upbringing it would do them no good to go to a competitive college. They would be better off at a state school where they have a better chance at success. If you get a low SAT score for whatever reason, that is outside of the range for a college, you probably will not fit there academically.  If we got rid of them and . students from sunnyside went to USC just like . students at basis do, they would just flunk out because it is way too high a jum p  
Her boyfriend who came from a less affluent household told her she looked absolutely miserable. He suggested she reevaluate her decisions and think about what makes her happy. Connolly had two more years of her program paid for but she thought about it and then sent an email saying she wouldn't be returning From there, her and the boyfriend went on a huge road trip and ended up buying a home with missing roof pieces in Kentucky. They lived in one room with a roof and with a mini refrigerator. Boyfriend got a brain tumor and she had to come back to tucson. Idk basically I thought it was just amazing how she decided what she really wanted. She was fine with her parents disappointment because it didn't matter I've been wanting to share that because I found it really insightful  And like I kept asking her questions about her happiness and how she developed this mindset. It probably sounds so cliché and movie-like 
I think basis needs to get it out of its head that u of a and Pcc aren't good schools for some people. It is the right fit for upward mobility for some people. If you come from a shitty background and want to succeed you need to take incremental steps. It's bad for basis kids but perfectly fine and great for others. So we need to not make a value judgment and feel sorry for them for going there, because that is what will give them the right push. It is just unfortunate that they come from lesser educational backgrounds. That is a really great story.  And it does sound cliché l o l I think basis needs to get any associations with failure in general out of its head. I hate how vocational schooling and specialization is viewed at the school.   Well it's because it's not our track. Pretty sure many plumbers aren't in love with the Ivy League either .   And like how Kristie said now that I go to basis I just don't know how to talk to people from public schools Well I'm not in love with the Ivy League either Ok sure but that's not the point. . . And plenty of people you would expect to go to one have criticisms of them I'm just saying that there is animosity between the groups. We look down on each other Ok this really isn't about the ivi e s Seminar kids literally spent a week tearing apart the Ivy League education. We even had Kordik come in and we talked to some of his Harvard friends Well tell me the main points and I'll take them down lol I'm saying we dislike vocational because that's what we aren't and we think we are superior but they probably feel the same way about their practical skills .   Lol that's what jay said after he said discrimination doesn't really exist Tell me the main points and I'll take them down Actually I think we had the conversation the week I read the article Jay and I are a lot alike in debate except that I stay inside the box and he throws away the box .   Like you and I had the Ivy League discussion I'll give you the article though It's very short Idek if you remember but it was basically that Ivy League schools train students for their professions where there are no rules and no deadlines Ok that's not even true lol That's more a criticism of the ivory tower Of academ i a And you said something about the guy being biased and jaded Not of the Ivy Leagu e   Also the Ivy League colleges foster this false sense of self-worth and smugness Ivy League gets a lot of future businessmen, doctors, lawyers, politicians. tons of rules, tons of deadlines. Sure there are some sociologists, but those are not at all limited to ivi e s Well it was that the Ivy League trains people for the upper class lifestyle 
True for most/all universities I would say. But yes maybe a bit more for the ivies. But not only the ivies at all. UChicago, Stanford. Any good school really. If this is a criticism of highly ranked schools it should say that instead of ivi e s
Professors at top research institutions are valued exclusively for the quality of their scholarly work; time spent on teaching is time lost. If students want a conversion experience, they're better off at a liberal arts college 
Less so about the upper class as years go on. True in the past, but today the low income enrollment is up and up. But really what does that mean? Training for upper class life. What does it involve? How do the Ivy students get specific training in this that other students don't?  OK I HAVE A GOOD ANSWer to that o n e The criticism was that those schools only teach analytical and rhetorical skills while liberal arts schools allow independent development  
That is factual at many schools. But you can't generalize ivies. Brown and Dartmouth in particular have undergraduate focus, and that is why I picked them. I think also Princeton. Not at all limited to ivies. State schools are soooo guilty of fucking over undergrads. U of A especially Again, generalizing ivies. Dartmouth and Brown ARE liberal arts school s   The article defines the Ivy League bestowed upper class lifestyle as rich and not really enjoying your job but enjoying the paycheck  If this wants to be a criticism of Harvard and Yale it can be that but I don't know why it doesn't come out and say i t . It basically is a Harvard Yale criticism Also Columbia 
See brown again (I am most familiar with them but may be true for others). Brown is all about finding what you are into through open curriculum and pass/fail. Other than the economics department I would say Dartmouth is too .   That is where the author has taught in the past Yes Columbia, I forgot them. But even harvard I really disagree with some poin t s Do you think the students at brown experience the inflated ego or have self-worth issues? I mean since basis kinda has that problem you might be oblivious to it 
Because these schools are the leaders in most fields, they really allow you to explore whatever you want, because you are told you can succeed in whatever because you are the best. And so I don't think it's about the paycheck .   Okay but the students who graduate from those schools are expected to get out more money than they put into it 
When you are actually at the school, with all the other smart as fuck people you can't revel in your self worth because you are in competition with equals. But say after graduating or when off-campus, probably. But I think it's true at every step. Harvard thinks it is superior to brown, brown thinks that about USC, USC thinks that about u of a, u of a about Pcc, and Pcc about those without college.  I think everyone on the educational ladder has inflated ego with regards to their inferior s So I feel like exploring may be encouraged, but lucrative jobs are implicitly encouraged even more There's always pressure No... you miss my point  The point is that you can succeed in anything, so pick what you love. And those who pay a lot have a lot, and those that don't don't pay a l o t Well with how practical all the intellectuals are these days I'm sure they realize just how successful one can be as an artist That is total bullshit ? What is total bullsh i t Success is always defined as income these days If you are coming from that ideology I can see how you would misunderstand  my word s . It's evident even at a school like basis where we are encouraged to be successful wherever we go Basis is a far step below a top college. Not comparable. What basis defines as successful and what a college defines as successful are so differe n t Maybe it's because I haven't attended any of those elite college presentations or even visited the school itself So I just don't know how this works Visiting the school is far more important I don't know how I could have made an informed decision without visiting  The information a website or presenter can give you is so inadequate .   I'm so curious about the Ivy League and elite school dynamic  Maybe I'll just visit to visit sometime next year It's the people. A feel. A look. The connections. All the schools I looked at are great and an alright academic fit for me. You should apply for those minority fly-ins Seriously, just visiting a college on a tour or something is like / of it. Still better than just a presentation  But also don't go visit somewhere you really have no chance of getting in. It will just make you sad  Unless it is for curiosity I would be crushed if I had visited dartmouth earlier and not gotten in. Actually I take that back. You probably would find it more interesting than emotiona l . Lol I already know the type of school I can get into and where I'm likely to go It would simply be an observation for me Also, please please really think about whether you can handle a large school (K+). It's like a city .   Although I fucking wish I had done better in school earlier because I know I had so much potential Fuck fuck fuck That is my biggest regret Transfers bitch Seriously a ton of people like you do i t   Why wouldn't I be able to handle a large school? I kinda like the rural school community feel but then also the opportunities that come with a large school Go to wherever. Do great .   Ya that's probably what I'm gonna do  *ipportunities w city How does money work with transfers? Well like its so anonymous. It's like a city. I think we take for granted the advantages of the small school.  I'm not saying rural I'm saying the K student school in NYC Versus K in LA.  You need to apply again for fin. Aid But you need to apply every year for it anyway so it's no differe n t But maybe it's time for a change. I often think about how nice it would be to see a different face every day. Sure but  is a new face a d a y What is your preferable class size? Probably K Well here is some back sto r y I mean per class... Oh ok nvm Mmm   - But I also want to know about the k God, also, one thing I fucking hate is when parents try to rationalize their children's shitty behavior  
I have been thinking a lot about what it is we talk about. Why is it way harder to strike up an engaging and long and genuine conversation with a stranger than a basis student I've never really talked to. Shared experience. Knowing the same people, the same teachers, the same stories. If I was at a college that big they might as well all be strangers. My class would have nothing uniting it. No funny stories we all know, or horror stories we all know, or people we all know of. And if I personally know  faces I am way more likely to run into someone I know around campus at a smaller school. I would feel that I am among strangers rather than my peers, I think.  Lol example? A college that big = K = u of a At K I think there is enough to keep it diverse and fresh without it becoming just a community of students.  But I think brown and dartmouth are also decent sized (K and K undergrads respectively) http//m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode//harper-high-school-part-one Not very far on this yet, but good so far. It won a lot of awards  Most downloaded episode of this american life ever I think when I think so much about how conversation works it stifles my ability to converse l o l
I think that's what I value so much about small classes and clubs. School population really doesn't matter to me all that much. When there is a small class then we are bound to get close and expand our friendships through others while sharing similar experiences.  Example every mother with a baby/toddler. Idk I've noticed this recently in a lot of mothers. My mom, the mom from this movie The Babadook I'll listen to it tonight! Lol same here. When I think about conversations in general and what to say next it exhausts me When it gets to that point then I'm not interested anymore What is so worthy of acclaim in this podcast? that true. I think the part I left out is that most of the time big schools have big classes you know? And big clubs too.  But you're right Like how do they rationalize it Well the premise of it is that They spent  months in this high school where  current and recent student had been shot.  And they reported their observations. And it's way different than what your vision would be of a school where that happen s   Yeah. I've never actually seen one of those huge lecture halls like in the movies but they sound dreadful hahah I have. It's very real And true for the very first introductory classes at great schools, and nearly all classes at othe r s
Well they blame it on their age even though correcting the behavior is effective. My brother has been screaming at the neighbor's dogs and he complained to my grandpa. My mom got upset and said he has a right to scream because he is a child That sounds great, I'll listen to it for sure I think of the huge lecture halls as only useful for philosophy classes, not anything substantial  
 students in one years. With a school of only . It's insane. Do it for sure Lolzz I mean maybe it's only useful for that. One thing I should add is that most have a big lecture and then smaller labs or discussion periods with TAs with under  people.  It's used for everything. Astronomy, sociology, biology, economics, business. Maybe not english quite as mu c h That's really fucking awful. If something like that happened at BASIS there would be a deeper sense of fear, pain, and pretty much everything actually I'm lying I have in fact been in a lecture hall but it was probably - students and we were watching a film So it wasn't too intimidating haha Also nsfw with snaps Bc ur the bae ❤️ Was this lecture hall, hmm, a movie theatre??? Jk Thx  b b I mean I can send more Hahahah no Dooooo eet You can continue if you desire but I finished, so I will be saving the art for tomorrow's viewing pleasure  Finished prematurely I might add ( Never as satisfying when that happe n s NO! The newest three are the best I'll send more I promise Also wow lol didn't help me out Maybe you can send apathy nudes I decided to move to a bed Oh sorry I was almost asleep wasn't thinking I will do  s o Actually save them But send some lol I'm sorry! Nice floral in the back You should send a video Like just to try it Your thighs look so nice Your abdomen looked very nice tod a y For some reason I felt really turned on by you But like this not bc of the pictures Lol I was gonna say God forbid When we fuck is a lot of it cerebral for you? Like thinking in loops. Wondering if I'm alone like  Lo l * That was beautiful Yeah, but I'm thinking about how you're feeling And I try to focus on how I feel He's loving my pulsing manmeat inside hi m Hahahahahahah It's nature's primal urge. I am man . I really want to fuck you Like right now I really just want to grab you  By the w a y Like cup my hand under you I decided that until I realize this is a dangerous idea I'm going to say yes to any request you have regarding sex But also I'm gonna keep a lot more condoms on hand for round  lo l . ;) I'm so happy aimee  Idk but I care about you so much And like this might be the wrong time And you might not care hahah I'm really happy t o o But I want you to know And I do care And I've had a really great conversation with you tonight You are really becoming more interesting by the day .   Hahah I swear I'll bring that article for you ) I've also had a great conversation with you Still you are a bit easily influenced in terms of your opinions on things, but it's nice to have someone open on the other hand .   And like I think about you all the time Wait which artic l e The article 'disadvantages of an elite education' I just want you to read it Oh right. Could you just send me the link lol? It's  br u h Lol somehow i knew you would say that I was wondering if you would ask for a link It's on JSTOR But you've got $$$ 
 That's cool I have JST O R No way Can I use your account sometime Holy shit Well, the whole senior class mooches off of hol l y That would have been so helpful And it expires in  days. . . For my papers this year Holy shit And I don't actually have the password. It's just in my laptop already ( But next year I'll give you my brown JSTOR in f o Lol that's what my grade did with Trenton's APUSH quizlet sets Wickedddddd I'll send the link soon then Also if anyone gets a U of A ID from summer work they probably have JSTOR Not sure if Diviya got one last year but if she did that would have access I would have died without JSTOR this year How can you do a research paper on something obscure without it? So much wasted time. I think Scottsdale has JSTOR for students ( But anyway I am super tired so I am gonna crash So good nig h t Connolly let us use her account in th but nobody appreciates it back then hahah. Alright! Good night < And I pity you for having to journey through the darkness that is research without JST O R We had EBSCO which is kinda tantamount  Lots of cool middle eastern stuff for me. I spent hours on it 
Next time we have sex I want a big giant slushie all over me. Slushie me. Let it seep through the threads of my boxer briefs. Then, I want you to take off my boxer briefs and wring them out over your mouth as you pant for slushie drops. As long as you . But slushie . Clean car . Bring a poncho . Put freshly laundered boxers on moments before this occurren c e Way to take all the fun out of it ( After all this glee slushie business I think it would be fun to try it once What Jay texted me at  am Oh my God I just walked in on my parents fucking. As if I didn't have enough reasons to joke about suicide. Ok! I'll throw a slushie at you? Just keep your phone in your backpack when you are around me for the near future lol Poor guy What's crackalack i(n )  /attachment.jpeg What I got in the mail earlier this year It's a sign. You know they never sent me sh i t Seriously, can you really do that though??? It was so sad. I was blowing my nose and I look over at this book shelf in the living room I never got an email, or mail, or even when they sent the final acceptance packet it was like  page s . Then I see this thing sticking out and I wondered if my mom hid it because it looked all fancy And then I went over and saw it. It was my dream school last year and before you even told me about it and I hid it there in August maybe? It was really depressing to see Also wanted to go to Harvey Mudd I'm going to do some calc and physics review today. Making a breakfast smoothie first haha. Then I'll work out later. Wbu? **hid it in October. I remember getting it around PSAT time Are you going to be a national Hispanic scholar I'm watching glee lol Half way through season  now Hopefully I can finish season  by next weeke n d Will you judge me if I'm drinking pulverized kale Ye s . Hopefully! I have to turn in my application still but it's easy ) And due in June What was your score? And percenti l e Lol that is insane. I am on episode  Ballad. I was up until  last night watching glee Ummm let me check Pulverize- smash by beating I tend to believe you used a blender.  It would be damn hard to pulverize kale.  Pulverize and blend have the same end result (a reduction to fine particles) but by different means.  #sorryimbeinganivybitch #sween e y I got rd when I should have gotten th Ahhhh thank you mister for your technical interpretations What about liquified I suppose. That sounds icky tho. But that's ok bc liquid kale is icky imo See ok that's a big plus For your app Plus the upward grade curve If you match that with an sat of  or act of  You could probably have a shot at Harvey mudd. That is, with a fantastic essay.  I think Fulford undersold you  That would be a far reach probably. But still a lot of good schools are a possibility. Like USC or something UCLA, tufts, Berkeley, vassar, Wesleyan. All options, I would say. Don't get down on yoursel f ! I'm taking both my SAT and ACT in June so I can dedicate time for those tests rather than having to do that on top of schoolwork  Did you always have Ivy League ambition? And did you ever have another profession in mind besides doctor? Hahaha thank you aimee I'll look into those schools and probably add them to that list you saw on my desk hahah Nope I hated the idea and didn't want to go Ivy ever. I wanted williams and amherst. But then $$$ happened and so yeah But then I realized no normal people have heard of those schools and I wanted to be cool so I decided to apply to ivies.  J k Hahah what changed? Why did you hate the idea? And yes I wanted to do economics for a very long time And then I wanted to be a research e r Did you explain the change in interests to the colleges or did you make it sound like medicine was always your passion? http//download.lardlad.com/sounds/season/getana.mp Neither They didn't ask I mean maybe like one did but it was a super short essay What you want to study isn't very important for applications lol So I just said I wanted to do that and the merits of it. Didn't imply one way or the other if it was a new or old passion I hated the idea idk why. I had an image of them, basically what the article you read described. And I didn't want that. But also small school size and rural areas were things I liked about williams and amherst. And the close relationship with profs Lack of greek life And sports (was wrong about sports, it's so big at amherst) http//www.foxnews.com/on-air/red-eye/blog////most-racist-places-us-revealed-based-google-searches Wtf is this vid e o I'm trying to expose my brother to culture and I'm having him do fun play dough experiments We're listening to Simon and Garfunkel And he sings with me Lol I so apologize for my snap respons e   Lol he is super overweight. My mom got him a bike today because he doesn't exercise That guy is so irritating. Also what if people just look up nigger to find out what it means Like that doesn't necessarily determine racism Oh nvm he's about to address that Lol Joann likes to search for nazi silverware Their attitudes are the funniest thing ever omg What else do you do in the mountains? You listen to rap But at least she is the most sensible bitch. Where did you find that? This is super flawed. What a waste of money, producing this show. https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=wzkpXYxko Legit basis propaganda  Omg the other math teacher looks just like swindle Same outfit, facial and head hair Wow Fuck that video WE LOVE OUR ADMINISTRATORS, THEY CARE LOL Eh it's not a waste of $ because I assure the show generates a ton of $ Childhood obesity is like the devil. Get on dat ( The cherry picked statistics gotta love em Like we get $k in aid cos we apply to a fuckton of lesser schools. How much merit aid is eventually used... Probably just the $K for the state school s .
the way they idealize the basis experience with their dramatic ass music and cinematography and the violins they throw around everywhere is unsettling. Also they really idealize the Ivy League life in this video. It's like they've totally neglected that we want you guys to have sports and drama and extracurriculars mantra to sell the AP oriented school experience. At least that's not a lie. Lol idk who would waste their time with that stupidity What were some tv shows you watched as a child? Why is coastal life desirable Yes I got the Ivy League thing too. But they didn't even have any students accepted to real ivies.  http//m.youtube.com/watch?v=ipeYpMZAt_U (couldn't find the real gossip girl clip, so this is a reenactment)  While looking for that clip I found this O http//www.ivywise.com/news_magazines_teenvogue.html Did you catch the kid with the perfect calculus score lol I dunno. Personally, I like sizable living spaces, low cost, nature, and a lack of rich douchebags. Fuck me right? Not a fan of the coasts I watched kids next door And really just everything on nick disney and Cartoon Network pre- Drake and Josh Icarly Suite life Wbu Not a fan of courage the cowardly dog or Ed Edd n eddy Sometimes I think I should settle for Columbia or Dartmouth or some other college I know I could never be content with what a bitch You know, if I've learned anything, it's that the whole you need to be perfect, and have a ton of community service and start a non-profit to get into an Ivy is SUCH a l i e
Have fun in Providence! Maybe you can get your hair dreadlocked while you're there I'm going to tell you that before you leave haha and after I take your Before picture. Each time you visit I'll take a picture of you to observe your transition into a drum circle semiotics major. Yes lol that was so stupid. They chose kids with such random credentials, like the West Virginia girl too.  I don't think she's saying that she's not content with the schools themselves. Rather, she has this deep desire to go to Harvard and she can't settle for any other great schools. She wants the best. Ivy or bust is so fucking pathetic. That is very unhealthy. Maybe you should write a blog to alleviate some tensions haha. Where do you see yourself residing? Those two Cartoon Network shows were stupid lol. Also courage freaked me out all the time. I watched the same shows but also Hannah Montana, Phil of the future, Lizzie McGuire It's kinda strange because Zayna didn't grow up with any of that THE PROUD FAMILY Ed Edd N Eddy is how I envision frat boys and state university straight boys It was UVA not West Virginia... One of the top  public universities.... I dunno... Maybe Washington or Oregon.  Which is coastal I suppose / but has less of the symptoms Courage made me so scared I also watched the three disney shows you listed. In fact I have Phil's autograph somewhere fuck I hated the proud family lol. I watched an episode a bit back and it is sooo stereotype. It is like enforcing that on children  Still pretty fun n y
I think you would fare pretty well watching horror movies after seeing how you were during It Follows. Ever since that movie I have applied your attitude of horror movies to others and I don't find them scary anymore  Only the few jump scares. I think the coastal situation you described earlier is more of a New England big city coastal problem. 
How did you get his autograph?!!! Lol yes! There are so many attempts at not being racist by creating black protagonists but they only reinforce stereotypes and undermine the intent by perpetuating them. Raven didn't do it as much though. A very basic nuclear black family with realistic problems and not a lot of emphasis on their race and the accent.  But like Suga Mama? Really...?? And the hairstyles oh god ( )  /attachment.jpeg Also a California problem He was at a JCC event years ago for israeli Independence Day I loved raven That show was ridiculous tho Eh his hair is what  was, Ya know What is my horror flick attitude? I was actually thinking about it and I really liked that movie Maybe not the zombie horror movies or horror actions movies but I could go for that type of sh i t We have a Raven dvd and a lot of things were ridiculous but had great underlying messages.  
Like where you're able to deconstruct a lot of scenes and understand what the director is trying to do, and then you don't get scared like I do. That's what I did with The Babadook. But what do you mean by that type of movie? What did you find enjoyable about it? I have jerked off every day since we last had sex Ok you have to watch the trailer for this movie tangerine. I just saw it on the imdb front page cos it looked trashy and it was more than I could have expected! Oh, yes, I do that. I mean the indie horror flicks, idk I liked it in a spring breakers kind of way. Can't describe I have too!  But that is not so unusual for me The movie was shot on the iPhone s. . . Lol the prostitution scene omg. It is trashy though but kinda enticing, you know? That was more reminiscent of indie action drama Spring Breakers than It Follows. We should see that together! I've been thinking about the time we were outside and I got the blowjob and I had you against the car and I went in from the back  Are you going to see the avengers? Awww there's a Little Prince movie coming out with James Franco Would it be uncomfortable for you to send a picture of full frontal I got the blowjob you got the blowjob?? Wow, congratulations!!! I can't imagine how a movie could sum up that book I suppose I will see the movie... Wh y ? Wow you shaved everything Not shaved just clipped It will grow back soon lol .   Lol idk if you've seen No Strings Attached but after they have sex Ashton Kutcher brings flowers to Portman's work and a balloon that says thanks for the sex Well I feel socially obliged to see the movie so maybe we can go see it Since the loft isn't having many good movies this month  I feel the same way about avengers Did you finish? You left me hangi n g I feel that way about all of these mainstream blockbuster films. I find obscure film showings much more exciting. It's kinda ridiculous how people get over those blockbuster films. Camping out and stuff lol. Oh I didn't know you were doing it! Sergio to the rescue Where do you position yourself when you're in the bathroom Btw I did finish hahah Oh ok then I'll find other material. Thank s ! I'm sorry ( No no it's fine I finished. It was grand I don't get the superhero obsession All the superhero movies suck IMO Seriously so boring Are you studying tonig h t My finish was grand as well. I was basically doing yoga in the bathroom, bending over as I finished. It was very nice. You never answered where you do it in the bathroom haha. Do you stand up? Okay I was going to suggest we go out tonight You're going to teach me all about the civil war hmmmm I don't do it in the bathroom Unlike lil Way n e Maybe volume of a solid revolution too Hahahah and unlike me too I can't do it standing up though. Only lying down. And usually only with underwear on. I need to learn to diversify.... Or buy a pair of assless underwear Like a jock strap I want to get ice cream too. Y a ? At first I read that as headgear because I was only half looking hahah I can teach you APUSH  Like legit tho l o l Yeah sure we can get ice cream You read what as headge a r lol I don't understand how people have trouble with history. If you actually study then it's not a problem. That's how it works for me. Sometimes I get annoyed because people ask the most self evident questions  I just listen to it like a story and so I never studi e d Whenever I ask questions it's to evoke discussion and it's usually only between me and billings Underwear as headgear That was me last year. But they were just questions. Questions for her that is What do they a s k Ok like in the beginning of the year billings showed us a picture of an enslaved family. Then someone raised their hand and asked how the slaves had money to pay for the portrait.  ?????!!!!!!!!?!!?! Or like % of Claire's questions Wait that's a fine question.... I mean it exposes the purpose of the photography. Is it their own? Or for a journalist? Or what.  At least it could be a good question with the correct intentio n s My grade isn't full of superstars like yours was haha. Nobody expects them to jump through those logical hoops. Your grade acts dumb But I don't think they are actually du m b The person was literally asking how the slaves paid for the portrait and billings gave this huge sigh and ignored the question. I must say that with very few exceptions I think everyone in my grade is very intelligent and capable How often do you soap your nava l ? I disagree. I think people in my grade aren't really smart but they just study a lot Navel* I said my grade  Not yours Read my li p s Lol you said my grade acts dumb and they actually aren't, but I think they are and they just study Oh Ya I forgot I said that sorry Opposite of my grade, real l y Ummmmm not often. Usually just around it. I don't soap my navel but I use a cotton swab. Wbu? Should I??? Idk I did today because I always just soap around it and so I smelled it because they say each one has unique bacterial flora. And it smelled interesting so I cleaned it And I took up flossing this week. I like it http//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumari_%children% https//www.yahoo.com/news/kathmandus-living-goddess-survives-quake-.html What's da pl a n How do you find out the smell? Did you just use your finger? I'll try that. What a strange tradition and specific lifestyle. I wonder what that girl must be thinking, brought up like that.  You know how Rastafarianism is associated with weed and stuff? Well they also revere the emperor of Ethiopia. It's pretty interesting. http//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari_movement Mmmmm well Richie just got back and he's being a bit rebellious  So maybe  Isn't flossing addictive! Ok update me if earlier will work Yes, lol Hallie selassi (spelling?) I know it bish! Yes I used my finger There's an autobiography about a former Kumasi Kuma r i I used my finger and it doesn't smell like anything? Then again, smells don't bother me and I tend to not notice them. Title?? earlier might work http//www.amazon.com/From-Goddess-Mortal-Story-Kumari/d p / Ummm more police trouble So idk... Again?!? Again?!?!?!? Why this time? ? ? ( Is your mom just calling the police for no good reason  What did he do Do you anticipate we will get to go out at all tonight or should I just go get  ice cream for myself l o l We can go Ill talk in a bit What time do you need to be home tonight Doesn't matte r   Ok cool whenever you want to go Ok I am leaving the house now th e n Alright! I'm all up in her e . Lol kk Sorry bb Are you mad   ,   Jacob Gabbitas got his mission call to Bolivia! Wow That's actually pretty co o l I KNOW!!!! Makes me kinda wish I was Mormon. But that's like the worst of the Latin American countries. So poor.  Interesting I suppose Also Honduras and Guatemala are not so nice.  Yes, except. I would want to explore the world Ya know Not be bound to that calling and have to keep it all in that context. To go on a mission affords no freed o m Maybe he can pull a Garden of Steven and have a secular awakening and then fuck the mission and spend the rest of his life among the villagers  That's the premise of this film I saw A what? O h It's actually really cute. If you have free time there's this award winning short films website  I'll send the link https//www.shortoftheweek.com/channels/israel/ I mean that's the israeli section but there's a Guatemalan one and that's where garden of Steven is Than k s Arianne got married And ya no problem To wh o m Seriously though you need to check out that website. There's also this film called La Cruz you should watch. It's on YouTube though. It smells very nice outside. Some military guy Can you find my celebrity doppelgänger  Yes but it is not the normal rain smell Are you not going to skool day Benjamin Bratt may b e Hey I went to school late today but it was such a waste of time Literally sat around and did some math problems all day What'd you do today? Also lol I don't think he looks like me at all. I feel like you chose some randomxican Jagath *hahah Not Jagath Where do you usually shop for shoes You and him have similar features Today I watched glee. And got a haircut I don't shop for shoes  I have specific shoes in mind that have the same price everywhere so it doesn't matter For dress shoes I happened to buy mine at h&m because I was there buying a tie. But that was coincidenta l   Hey bae Is your haircut anything different I hate talking about these tests but they're so fucking stupid oh my god I've been doing math prep all afternoon And I also went shoe shopping My mom didn't know that visiting colleges is a thing so she wants me to go to the northeast this summer Like for the last week of 
 ,  No it's a lot shorter but it will return in a few short weeks I tried to follow the solution for a BC FRQ and it was a challenge. I feel bad. One of the brown kids posted it LOL.  Tbh it's probably not a good use of your time or money at this point... Much better to have a clearer idea of which schools plus have students there plus be on a program If I were you I would look into the fly-in applications ASAP Many are due during the summ e r I hate those haircuts! On myself. I feel like they're just a waste of money. I'm seriously considering shaving the sides like you suggested. Lol I can probably solve it hahhhh Basically I'm going to use it as an excuse to travel by myself hahah I might sneak into some classes Pretend I'm a student Befriend some students and get into the parties But they don't have classes in  Or parties Or anything Except at Dartmouth because they are weird But literally nothing goes  o n THAT IS LITERALLY THE POLSTRA SELFIE HOLY SHIT You forgot the shirtless part (; Idk whylissa and Martha are visiting Massachusetts then lol I guess they won't be doing anything  They can do tours I suppose. 
I really think it is a waste to go all the way out there during the summer to do that. If it were closer, sure. Need to go during the school year. That is the beauty of the basis senior year. You have so much time to do that kind of thing 
But also, people don't tend to be so friendly to people just touring and not affiliated with an event, from my experience. It's really too bad. Maybe it's different at schools where people have more time to frolic about .   Never drink tea after eating mustard... So you suggest the fly in and staying overnight in the dorms then rather than touring? Do you get a tour with the fly in? Mm sometimes? The tour is really really inconsequential 
Like you just walk around and say what the buildings are and they say a bit of history. The walking around you would get anyway and the history maybe not but its really never a lot. But on most fly-ins you would have an option to take a tour Well yes I recommend that but it is not an option for a whole lot of schools before applying.  I would say go to as many of those for schools you are at all considering But the schools with less money aren't going to do them as much Ok and also I don't know if I said this earlier but Has your mom said anything regarding financial aid? What are her plans? Assuming she gets better in the near future and goes back to work, you are going to be pretty fuck e d I've walked in on some UA tours and it was the most boring and unimpressive thing I had ever walked into. But I've heard that just visiting kinda boosts your chance for acceptance. Lol Pima fly in Well she just had surgery and she's going into physical therapy this month So this year for income is going to be pretty dry She hasn't worked since Jan rd I think? And she won't be going to for a while.  When do you start financial aid stuff? It's actually just gauging interest. That can be done many ways.eting with the rep at the school visit. Just going to the school visit. Signing up when they hand out the lists at the visits.  going to visit the college will not make a large impact and probably no impact given you meet them at school. Also it is very few schools that gauges the visits, I believe.  Ok so you will probably get a nice package for your first year of college at least.  
Also let me just say, everyone more or less gets into the schools they ought to get into. There aren't surprises for the most part, other than the schools with such low rates that it's a crapshoot for all. Visiting or not visiting is a part of a broader mythology of minor things one should do to get ahead. I think all of it is BS. Either you have what they are looking for in the meat of your application (GPA, scores, essay, recommendations, course load) , or not .   Hey sorry b I need to finish studying and then go to bed really soon. It's not like I have tests tomorrow LOL. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Goodnight! Alright good luck on math!!!! In ex machine he cut himself to prove to himself he was human Machi n a Hey How was your day today? Why did you originally think he cut himself I had no idea at all It was ok. I really didn't do anything. I am so glad you guys are out soon because I am beginning to be so bored Wbu How was  i t
It was soooo fucking stupid. Today the college board sent representatives to basis to watch our AP ceremony. the school went all out and got post AP pizza, a balloon entrance arch, and the tunnel went throughout the entire school so th graders were also part of it Hahahahahahahs LOL LOLOLOLOL O L I kinda knew that was the reason. I just thought he was so caught up in this machine world that he wanted to make sure he was still human So I guess I'm right ) Math was pretty okay. The only difficult part was the last  FRQs no calculator. And then I was supposed to take seminar today but they ordered me the late test and my chinese cancellation fucked everything up.  Zayna and jen and I left early and we went to Zayna's to watch pulp fiction but let me tell you something Zayna was like, yeah you can come but my dad kinda doesn't like you right now. I had never had an extended conversation with her dad and I didn't know why feelings like this would come about, right? She said it was because I'm with you. I started crying and I got super upset and I told her that is really unfair and rude. And I told her I'm just not going to go back on  Ok but this isn't leaving us AHDOFPEOETJRNFNXOODWK FJEOWKSOCRLEB ( That's great! Here's hoping for that . So when are you taking seminar? (. I'm sure he would feel a bit differently if Zayna didn't embellish the story.  Why the capitals? Are you and her ok still after tha t ? I'm pretty confident! For sure a  or . 
Seminar is happening during the late testing session, which happens in two weeks. That might not seem like a big deal but I was kinda worried about taking it today. I need to review the rubrics over that time and do some practice essays with Rosinbum. 
Her default story is always the I love Palestinians one. And capitals because I am fucking pissed off! I told her that who I am with should be none of his business and that I didn't feel comfortable being there since he feels that way. She actually felt bad about the whole thing and told me to just stay but neglected the other stuff Idk. I need to talk to her when I'm calm. Lol imagine if we met again in  years and I'm some manager at the college board  Brian Simpson puts African on all the standardized test forms and as his race since he was born in South Africa, even though he is super white. ( )  /attachment.PNG I really like it when you send me articles and videos throughout the day haha, it's so sweet. Sorry b I'm in my bass lesson. Will respond aft e r I figured haha don't worry Tbh it'll just help him get into the U of a instead of being stuck at pima so I don't judge that hard. Sarah Wooders is another story Pacific Islander my ass, that bitch is asian Did you see this college board guy What's up Are you studying What is tomorr o w Yeah, I saw the guy but he just looked like a young pretentious rich white guy with gay subtleties. What is Sarah? I thought she was Vietnamese. Tomorrow is the chinese final.  is physics.  APUSH. I'm just reviewing my chinese stuff I don't get how Reza failed because she literally told us what is on the final I've also been checking my eBay watch list. Sperrys and oxfords end in a day! Lol Look up this movie Maggie. It's a zombie film with Abigail Breslin and Arnold Schwarzenegger and it actually looks intriguing. Omg we can be that gay couple that matches She is Japanese Alright I'll look it up Maybe she does that now because he failed lol Well tbh he just doesn't know chinese so even if he knew what was on it it doesn't matt e r Wow bitch we somewhat match occasionally. Probably will more often w my new Aimee inspired clothing purchases.  Mmm I don't think so. She's always very generous Ok idk if you'll like the movie though because it's one of those emotional horror films Yeah probably not, I really don't like Arnold Any other exciting movies coming out? I love going to see movies with you It's like the highlight of my week ( )  /attachment.jpeg 
 painting by ottoman artist Osman Bey. I really love it ( )  /attachment.jpeg And here's a shitty photo of the cardinal that was in my yard toda y .
Islamic art and architecture is my favorite! There is this illustrated epic, Hamzanama, with over , detailed illustrations. It is so beautiful, you HAVE to look it up. It's the ancient Persian equivalent of the Illiad and the Odyssey according to the NYTimes lol. But like I used to go to the art section of bookstores and always look at pictures of Islamic art. I love seeing movies with you too! It's such a nice tradition < Sometimes I look at my watch list and count how many movies we have seen together and I count how many movies I've seen between moves we have seen together I saw this very beautiful red chested bird a few days ago but it was too fast and flew away ( I'm seeing Roar tomorrow haha I'll tell you how it is This week there's Clouds of Sils Maria and Lady from Shanghai Both films I want to see Lol why roar? It looked SOOO bad? Is that why you are seeing it lol Are we going to be able to hang out this weekend I'll check the Muslim Iliad out  Birds are so fick l e Hahah roar because I was asked to see it. Maybe it will be a good movie to laugh at Yes we can, on ? I kinda need to because I have to buy a Mother's Day gift So are energetic dogs, damn it! I notice how you are using passive verbs to avoid saying who you are going with bitch Can't fool me #i v y Hahaha I'm going with Bella Ya huh Alright. Saturd a y I subconsciously use passive when I don't want to draw attention to those details, it's not intentional though lol Maggie @  PM screen  so we can get the cou c h You don't have to see it only because I want to! I want us both to enjoy the movie and I know you don't do zombies.   ,   There's a new song with Britney and Iggy lol. Pretty Girls. Ooh! Ok well if any other movies come to mind. I think I can handle Magg i e Alright cool. Goodnight ) Goodnig h(t )  /attachment.jpeg No thx brown be a r Isn't that so cute!!! How was your day? What is it? The snap? My day is alright. I'm gonna go volunteer with Reza at saaf lat e r No, the bear is cute What do you do there? Like what does volunteering consist of Eh it depends. It could be just about anything Did you know the brown bear is the brown mascot? Was that intentional How was your d a y Oh ok Yeah! It was intentional actually 🐻 Jk no it wasn't Roar was such a bad movie. It seems like it should have been a mistake and I'm so surprised that it wasn't. Both the acting and story were super shitty and we laughed during the entire movie Chinese final went well. and omg APUSH review was the most helpful thing ever Now I've just gotta do a bunch of physics tonight How is/was volunteering What was the story? That's fantastic? When is your last exam again? It was fine There were two socially awkward asian guys And a gay ass heroin addict They were from cat foot, the Asia n s
Well there's a family and the mom and dad got into some argument, so the dad flies to Africa to do some research and studies the animals. I guess the family decides to come visit him and he's out an about so the family settles into his house. Basically the entire movie is about how the family is unaccustomed to the animals and freaks out, until the dad gets there and he says they're not really harmful, just playful But the mom bitch does a lot of screaming and there's a lot of falling into the water Yes! Very fantastic. Last exam is seminar during projects lol. Maybe I'll volunteer at this place sometime lol My mom and I just got into this argument because she wants me to babysit on  while her and Richie go out And I told her that's such a waste of time because he hates us and that I don't like him. then she was like brothers are brothers and I totally disagreed and said its just a label What's up sugar bun That's like saying children shouldn't be stopped That's so dumb I just got home So I am laying in the dark That's a boring plot Ok when's the last non-seminar so AP Are you gonna babysit, the n ? It's so fucking stupid. I told her forgiveness only works in the real world once the person is not currently doing whatever it is that bothers you. It was boring but it was entertaining Also weird knowing that so many people were injured and they required stitches and plastic surgery // language, why'd *why? Party day hahaha? I'm not sure (
 ,  People were injured on the set??? Oh I just figured we could go out to celebrate Ok just let me know if/when you have free time over the weeke n(d )  /attachment.PNG Lol. Shit's intense. Yeah we should totally go see a groovy movie and eat somewhere nice You know I haven't had hot wings in years! And I think we should try some ???? Sure. I hear Rocco's is good For wings OH FUCK I HAVE A GREAT ID E A
The production filming schedule for this movie was originally project estimated to require six months. In total, it took seven years to film the movie, four of these were spent completing the principle photography. Shooting was delayed at various times for varying reasons such, the flooding of the ranch being the main one. The on-set disasters literally added years to the shooting schedule. PM screening room animal house Sunda y   It was released in  OHHHH I thought it was n e w That pizza place? Oh ok, we can also do Buffalo Wild Wings sometime. Mmmmmmm that's Mother's Day and western moms take that shit seriously I'll see tho and get back to you I might have to go to some dinner  pm   Is also a show ti m e Have you seen that movie before? Yes Alright well anyway I'm going to sleep. So hope it goes ok with your family for the remainder of the evening. Goodnigh t ! goodnight💝💝💝 http//www.yahoo.com/finance/news/james-franco-mcdonalds-no-one-.ht m l Hi! How are you? How was your day today? That article isn't up anymore but I saw it this morning before I went to school lol. It was like, According to Reuters, Franco still enjoys McDonalds hahah. Also, I'm halfway through the latest This American Life 
I just took my physics exam, and by just took I mean literally. We started late around  because AP Spanish ended late. Then kids were like, oh on the exam book cover it says  we can refuse to take the test if it's administered at some time other than -pm and so the proctor had to call the office and it was this huge deal But the exam went pretty well. MC was difficult but it was good. Thank you for your AP prep books haha ) This last one had some shining moments The Korean story was great My day was ok. Fine except meeting with ATC was unproductive What ended up happening The physics curve is nice so hopefully it's ok As I said I skipped - FRQs and got  a   Yeah the Korean story was my favorite. The stalking one was just plain bizarre, like I couldn't even relate and I thought she took it too far. Well we had to take the AP haha. Ate too much pizza afterward (  This is a different test though. They changed it this year We only had  FRQs! It was really sad because Demi didn't even sign up for the AP but had to take it And she didn't even study or anything I know I thought it was such a waste of money, and so strange Is pizza standard this year? Why did she have to take it Has she still not passed one? I was surprised I hadn't heard the Korean story, because it involves a top celebrity of thei r s Hey so APUSH ends around noon tomorrow. Maybe do something after or later? Yeah and like she flew out to different places and dedicated precious time to pointless endeavors To be fair we waste a ton of time on dumb shit perpetually She is entitled to th a t Maybe haha. But I got all the teachers nice Lindt's chocolates to make it up to them and it's just what I do Sorry my phone almost died, just got home to charge Yeah let's hang What do you want to  d o Idk why she had to take it but that's not any of my concerns right now. Right now what I'm worried about is this exam haha. I've got to cover -present in .- hours Or... Go to sleep ) J k We can see a movie and get chicken wings or go somewhere nice since I'll basically be done with APs Lol there's a difference between our dumb shit and dedicating money and weekends to stalking your father and photographing him  We could see get hard Eh hate we lets talk tomorrow I'll come by at like  Study wel l ! Okay, thanks ) goodnight!   ,   There's this post AP lunch thing I got invited to Is that okay? Or do you want to come? Or maybe we can do something after that Which is the best thing to do I'm like already here doing an SRP thing, when does the lunch go unt i l Ok just come with us Are you leaving now? I'm still in S R P Mmm we're leaving for BJs around / I'll let you know Ok I'll be done By th e n Ok cool

Ok thanks bb Had fun w you tonight Goodnight! Goodnigh t ! I find action movies so hard to follow and I am really lost with Drive. Like the blood and gore is actually pretty awesome but mobster movies with covert operations and plans are confusing. 
Also I had this weird dream that I texted you about some party I was throwing. So like for the party I had to go to party city but I got trapped in there with somexicans and kim and Kanye and they decided to do an impromptu photo shoot with party city supplies. Then I had to drive to phoenix for some interview and I ended up renting a penthouse hotel for the day (even though I was staying for like  hours) and I sent you all these really pretty sunset pics and selfies lol. After that I drove back to tucson and had to babysit this prodigy ninja baby girl who could do a  foot jump over the monkey bars. And like the baby's dad just threw her on the floor and let her crawl and catch herself. Anyway, once I finally made it to the party you couldn't go ( 
There's this film I really want to see. I heard an interview with Carey Mulligan on NPR and it's about this girl in Victorian England who attracts three different suitors but it's so gorgeous and looks good. It's called Far From the Madding Crowd What are you doing today? Imagine masturbation pre-Internet I feel the same way usually but drive was great for me That's such a crazy dream When is it coming out? Today I am at the family friend's for a bit and then I'm free wbu #playboydrea m s I mean I like drive too but the plot is hard for me to follow. I also never understood the Ryan Gosling craze until now hahah It was such a cool dream though because I felt like a cowboy. The Graduate is playing at the fox theatre on May  Fuck! It's only at Harkins Today I'm going to church and then babysitting from - and then not doing anything. Do you actually think Get Hard looks good? He is so cool in drive. I felt the same way Wait which is at harkins Lol but that's PM No not really, but given how much everything else suc k s Oh ya u might want to delete Instagram I already di d  
I love that bad boy driver look and he pulls It off really well. Last year I used to wear baggy jeans and a long sleeve denim shirt and timbs because I thought I looked like kanye and like a badass but then Priscilla made me realize how bad it was  Far from the madding crowd at harking What do you mean at PM I love the Korean gangster look though, where they think OBEY and Nike are cool Lol you should dress up like that and send a selfie I don't like asian gangster lol I like Chris thou g(h )  /attachment.JPG Babysitting until  prevent any later things Hahaha How often do you shave the full beard I shaved tod a(y )  /attachment.PNG Yeah I like Chris too. Like if I had loads of money I would dress like him What does she me a n I don't think it prevents later things lol I have come home at  on school nights I'm starting to shave the full beard each time I shave so this marks the second time. I'm going to do it every .  Wbu? Oh she says because she's never seen me shave before lol ( )  /attachment.jpeg That's the black kid ( )  /attachment.JPG Also on the top next to Emma Oh he doesn't look white I mean black And he looks  I shave like every - days, sometime I skip the mustache Ok what would you want to  d o What does he look like? Hey hey hey I'm sending you this sentence I made up so I can remember some things to tell you I had a dream we were on a road trip to a church to stab it I remember reading diary of a wimpy kid and Greg was going into middle school and he was like there are always gorillas in th grade who shave  times a day but like our school only had the Soras Maybe we can do coffee with Reyna? He looks half-Hispanic  Lol our gorillas don't shave Yeah that sounds aweso m e Lol alright so here's the plan 
 we're doing a triple date thing downtown Nate called So we might do food for ascension or tea and then walk around Reyna and James are coming too Aig h t Is that ok with your Religion Yes Should I pick you  u p I meant is it ok with u to do that but I autocorrected to your and I rolled with it Mmm I can get a ride if you can't take me Yep I gotcha From your hous e ? I don't want you to waste a bunch of gas though But yes my house Eh I do that anyway Ok so Should I come at like  to be sure your mom is hom e ? Lol I could also let you know if she's home Well yeah but it takes me  min to get the r e She's at golf n stuff right now ( ? I am confuse d   Well idk when she's coming home I can ask Like she was only supposed to go out for dinner But my brother is a manipulative little fuck Fuck him for having fun on his birthday at your minor expense Jk I get  i t ??? It's not his birthday lol His birthday is in  Or is it? Dun dun sun Dun Ok I have  stories to tell you in the car, remind me and I will remind you of the ones you earlier mention e d Maybe we can go at  . Reza's birthday . Santa n a I'm expecting to be out pretty late tonight Where is GP A ? GPA getting high On jesu s ? Cuz you know, I'm pretty sure my AP scores will be good Grand p a Lol jk He's at the store but I promised to babysit When is Reza's birthday? That's the question .   Oh it's the same week as yours actually So around the end of Jan My mom thinks she will be home in two hours ( What the fuck What the fu c k Like last week he was flipping her off and ran away Apparently that means nothing to her That's like too late. That would mean dinner at   - He's literally just using her Ok he's a kid I was the same way You need to cut him some slack, kids use their parents continually. That's like the point of childhood You can't apply our interpretations and morals like that I was a shit as a kid constantly and if my parents punished me all the time I would have just hated them more and had no chance of a relationship ever. Your mom is being reasonable She is trying to mend things and give him good memories with her in hopes of a long term succe s s
When I was a child I constantly saw through the material things my parents would buy me to make up for whatever, and I would call them out on it and would refuse to accept it. And when I was in the wrong I would sit by myself until I was ready to ask for forgiveness, rather than pretend it never happened and accept gifts.  It just doesn't make sense to me Well then you should know that most or many kids are not nearly as emotionally mature as you were And your mom's behavior in this case is normal. And I'm not saying that she's always right with respect to him, and of course not that he's always rig h t I was just a really quiet kid at home and tried to never get in trouble and then when I went to school I released all of my repressed shitty behavior lol So I guess that's where I was in the wrong Lol I was so the opposite Perfect at school, massive raging asshole at home Anyway Is she really gonna come that late? It might be ok for us but not the other .. .(. )  /attachment.PNG Yayyyyy Lol that was the obvious solution all alo n g Well it's okay for Reyna and I texted Nate/Diviya about it, so I can actually leave early (~) since it starts at  and downtown is far She just hates leaving Alex w gpa because he gets upset sometimes Look at what my mom sent me a few weeks ago; ( )  /attachment.jpeg hott 😻 You look like middle school nightmares Ok I'll come around th e n You can actually come around  Ok Sunday ,  He r e Ok cool like  seconds Hey, how was volunteering? How are you feeling? It was really fun! I feel so exhausted though. I took a nap and it made me feel worse. Wb u ? Hey Sorry b That's cool. Was the aftermath of the match really sticky and sexy I just woke up I had this dream that you and I were older and comparing out AI abilities (because in the future each person gets AI assistance as they age) Lol no, the jello was fun to touch though I most just cleaned buckets and tarps and picked up trash What was our AI like? What did you do tod a y Today, Aimee darling, all I could do was think about how beautiful and intimate last night was Jk lol. I did that and other things. Once I got home I put my gifts on the table and then my mom started crying and thaaaat whole thing happened I set up mouse traps haha We went to the mall and saw the Avengers which was terrible. I couldn't even add it to my watch list. Then we went out to dinner and I fell asleep and now I'm here. Kinda having trouble staying awake. It was one of thoooose naps You need to watch this video lol http//www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tnt-academy-founder-apologizes-after-all-black-people-remark-graduation-n What else did you do today? Idk basically we had memory assistance and the ability to watch movies in our minds and it was this robot implanted in us that remembered everything we saw  I only had that dream because the avengers was all about AI Some action films with very meticulous villains scare me because I think that anybody could watch the movie and be inspired by whatever this villain did and already have the logistics to execute the crime  Which are always so massive with many casualties in the film I never really think of superhero villains as criminals What all did you get your mom again I had trouble staying awake too. So exhausted still Was it worse than the first avengers I watched some glee Literally all I did. Oh I got burritos after volunteering with Reza because I didn't have breakfast    ,   I'm not necessarily talking superhero villains but like antagonists in realistic movies.  I literally just got her flowers, a UA cup, nail polish, chocolate, and lip balm. She says the card was the most beautiful thing though. It was waaaaay worse And it completely dragged on Lol that sounds like a day Right now we (Madeleine and Diviya) are trying to work out how this hotel business is going down Also I'm so excited because I only have to go to school on  this week A loft membership for a year is $  Oh, yes I thought about Nightcrawler a lot And how we get media, like TMZ, and the ethics of it I, on the other hand, need to go like every day for a couple minutes to meet w Mr J Oh that's pretty good Is your mom proud of her alma mat e r
Yeah that's probably what made nightcrawler x more disturbing for me. Clearly a very extreme case of that, but it made me wonder about news footage in a new way. I don't think they're allowed to show graphic images like that on TV though.  Even now that school is almost over? She is, which I don't understand. I don't think it's made her any more intelligent. Where did your parents graduate from Well goodnight my love <  For SRP, so yes. 
Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University for college and grad school. Then Claremont McKenna my mom started PhD, and finished at the U of A, which is actually the number one public school and number three school overall in her field of study Sorry I was shower But anyway goodnigh t ! sometimes it's weird saying goodnight when I think you're asleep and then you're not, so I just don't reply because then I think you're actually going to sleep hahaha Yes sometimes You say goodnight and even if I am not asleep I don't respond as to not make it awkwa r d Well last week the only reason I sent goodnight first was because I had to study haha Not because I was actually going to sleep  I was up until  am last night because I watched this gay movie, Weekend, and I listened to  minutes of the latest this american life Which had such a lame intro Study for language? Was it a good movie Haven't started this week's podcast yet I was curious, so I looked into it, and there is an asian hj massage place next to BJ ' s No last week to study for apush Lol it's one of those indie romantic movies. No interesting developments Are you coming to the school today? You should take me somewhere because I'm bored out of my fucking mind I wasn't going to but ok I guess I c a n An Asian hj place?! I watched this show where an uncle took his nephew to one so the nephew could tell his friends he got a hj Like a tj grader Oh well you don't have to if you don't want to 
 Nah I probably should see mr. J, I'm just being lazy.  Actually He's probably busy by the time I would get there. I'll just come by and we can hike I think Demi could work at o n e Ok cool what time? Lol so could you I'm not asian though Kkkkk Here A y Hey bae I just woke up Damn, I'm so exhausted Idk what it is How are you feeling? Y tu mama tambien tomorrow? ( )  /attachment.jpeg Jennifer sent me this picture. This is her coworker who she thinks is exactly like me and looks similar to me and is also gay, and she literally always tells us that we are basically like each other  He is like if you and Anthony and a person with ridiculous cheek bones mixed He is so strange looking! So about the movie, I have a bass lesson until  so consider that and traffic and picking you up and the fact that it is free.... So I think it could only work if you got there on your own. Is that possible I figured you were sleeping How long did you nap f o r I think he looks half black and halfxican. Also, I think he resembles Zayn Malik. The guy in the picture is too beautiful to be true. I would be too intimidated to even look at him. 
That is possible. I can get a ride but I don't think I can do much afterwards, considering how awful I feel when I don't get a lot of sleep. So I think I should get home at a reasonable time so I can sleep at a reasonable hour, I'm sorry! See I so disagr e e I slept from -ish Hahahah. He is like when someone is so distinctive it is either God level hot or super not and I feel he is the latter No that's fine. So no movie? I'm fine with just the mov i e Oh yeah. That's how I feel about Gil and Elliot.  I have a real question for you please don't judge me But I think I'm going to ask you my life questions because you make me feel comfortable about my intelligence insecurities  When do you use whom?
 ,  What do you mean life questions and what do you mean use?   ,   Yes to movie but I can't do something after.   ,   Like I mean questions that arise throughout my day about word usage and concepts of things that people should know OMG OK I thought this was like philosophical Like when I consider it OK to use people I thought it was a moral challenge within y o u I've decided that while I can kinda blame my mom for a lot of this, I want someone to teach me the right way and call me out Hahahahahahah Well you're not dating Jay P Tbh I never really notice who vs whom and I don't think others do either.  I always thought it was that if it was as a direct object it is whom, but I never really thought that through and now it is very confusing And so I looked it up and it is like mental gymnastics So I would say if someone calls you out or judges you, they are a dick. Pretty sure Joseph is the only one who like actually knows the rule. I just usually know which one sounds right in a sentences  Sorry b I would die if I was dating jay because he never will discuss things practically. It always boils down to his weird philosophies which are all he is willing to speak about If I wer e *
Yeah because I think you've used whom before? and I think it's more convenient to just say who. I used to know the rule in th grade but when I don't use it for many years then it's unimportant. But yeah, I'd rather ask you some of these things because they are things I have looked up and been totally perplexed. Lol YESSSSSSS. Sometimes I just don't talk to him because a lot of his arguments are circular and he changes his opinion at least once during the argument. Idk he told me that he acts this way because in India he always questioned society and the government, and he found it fun to do so, so he does that here too Knowing these bullshit philosophies though don't do much for his arguments And half the time nobody knows what he's saying unless they've taken a class Which frustrates me Because then it makes me feel kinda stupid for not knowing this concept, until I realize nobody else knows too haha except him I often wonder how certain people, like Jay, talk with their partners http//www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tnt-academy-founder-apologizes-after-all-black-people-remark-graduation-n I cannot imagine how him and Elizabeth work o u t http//www.addictinginfo.org////racist-georgia-school-founder-blames-the-devil-for-her-graduation-destroying-rant-video/ Also this website, with very funny ads haha Neither can I lol. But I've never talked to Elizabeth extensively so idk if she's kinda the same way. ( )  /attachment.jpeg I thought  Jordan rd. was something about shoes on the first read. It's weird when addresses have such low numbers  Did you know our address system is based on distance from Stone and Congress? Like  W.ans  Mile west of stone I suppose she took  years of critical theor y
  mom, why are you only eating bread and butter for dinner? Mom it's organic. You know she bought me kombucha because it is healthy, and after reading the wiki page and stuff, there have been more reported deaths and illnesses than health benefits *healthy That is actually such an interesting fact! How did you know that or how did you find out? Have you tried it with your address Like how would it work with my address So in theory my house is . miles east of that intersection Omfg I learned just now that sahaurita is West of here!! I thought it was south, nearly green valley Ah Nope, the map was just turned sideways Ok so I did a not very accurate approximation on maps and got . miles. So factor how rough an approximation and I think it could be correct Lol And besides the lack of health, kombucha is like raspberry vinegar it is so nasty tasting What is wrong with it in terms of health though? Logan Graybill explained it to me in freshman year I think his dad is a city planner or knows one Lol that is probably the least nutritious meal ev e r So then mine is . miles east. That is such a life hack wow. Like I could just hear an address and basically get a general idea of where it's located. Oh yeah hahah. I used to live  min east from there in Vail. It's like southwest. Well there is no evidence for any health benefits, that's the thing. There are only cases of CNS impairment and liver toxicity. And it's like $ a bottle I thought that was quote worthy lol when she said that earlier I knew I had to tell you How would you differentiate between right and left quadrants though, using that system? Like when does north turn into east, etc? Ok so the East-West running streets are lettered either east or west, and the same for north-south running roads And the east-west are usually called street, and the north-south are avenue 
 N. st Ave vs  E. th St 
So like if you heard  E. th St. You would theoretically know that it is on th street (which could be anywhere north/south) but surely  mi east of the intersection. It could be  E. th and be  miles or . miles from the actual intersection .   It's weird to me that I have lived in tucson and never known that, and that I couldn't figure out the avenue/street thing or any of this on my own. Oh ok so there is no way to tell northeast or southeast from the system Are a lot of other cities like that? I think most newer cities are like this. Older ones have small numbers.  That are just like counting how many residences on each street. So if you built one inbetween it could be  /z  (. )  /attachment.jpeg This really depresses me. Idk I feel like if I had a chronic illness I wouldn't post things like that. Also did you watch the graduation video finally Whenever I receive snaps from you it feels like such a gift and I have to wait until the right time to open it Yes lol I did Lol it is the kind of gift where it could be like a pair of socks or a new laptop. You just don't know until you open it I can't believe we had sex In an open place today In broad daylight I feel sorry for her but her public pity party makes me feel lesser. It's so s a d Lol no, it's a kind of ephemeral cerebral gift. Like mind candy. I don't know what it will be and the only hint I have is the red or purple box  Lol all I meant is that it could be awesome or like whatev e r Honestly the setting made it very enjoyable for me. I don't get paranoid in public places like that, it's nice. A place that would be kinda thrilling to have sex would be downtown Or in a library or in a church Like the Bookman's bathroom Yeah that would be co o l Is it rude to come for some SRPs and then leave during the break Also are you required to stay I do not know the answer to either I don't even know what time it is  a t Lol you're going from - I remember when these had just started and I looked at Isamu's Jewish identity thing and i don't think he did a good job of synthesizing the info he got from the interviews Like he wrote the things he heard but never explained it and idk. It just seemed really inconsistent and it frustrated me And like basically it's just a bunch of pictures of things he saw while visiting different cities with the occasional mention of an interview where someone talks about what kind of Jew they are Something I would love to do my SRP on would be extremism in Turkey or Israel or the role of women/muslims/jews/etc. In society but it seems too charged 
So Sonoran Science Academy offers Turkish and has a big Turkish population, including faculty and students, and I remember Richie's dad would always condemn them and say awful things about why we have to learn Turkish and why an American can't run the school So in th grade when I went there a lot of students shared this anti-Turkish sentiment, which now is absolutely deplorable At least for me Well from what I heard there was a bit of Turkish superiority going on by the Turks there? Which led to resentment, I heard. When did you go see his SR P ? Yeah there is. Like there were some exchange students from turkey and they were revered by all the staff, no matter what they did.  Also it was strange to take Turkish of all languages I wish I had paid more attention in the class though I didn't go see his SRP, it's on the same day as yours lol. But I've been following his blog and it pisses me off. Veris, Diego, and Chaiyo took their APs high. All of the APs?  Well high is their resting state by now.. Oh speaking of which http//www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp////no-marijuana-use-doesnt-lower-your-iq/ Also I have been on 🌿for the last  hours But it has been mild. Idk w h y This group of students scored roughly % lower on school exams taken at age  it's funny how relevant that was lol And sure maybe it doesn't affect IQ But during the test you're not able to think clearly and focus No sure it was just related because It was on my mind I worry a lot about it causing iq lo s s Really? Hahah So before hitting it today I looked it up and found that article as the second resu l t Do you think it influences some conversation topics Or like things that you say Because when you're high I can't even tell You talk about the same things in the same way Whereas with me I talk about weird things I usually don't That congratulatory email you received from V's mom made me really sad Sometimes yes, today, not really I overthink things and write them over and over to get them right now Yes   ( How do you think your mood changes? Are you more sensitive (like how you were on  when I touched you) or contemplative? And what do you think about What are you thinking about right now Haha I remember my first really good high and it took me minutes to write a coherent text A lot of these SRPs are so fucking technical, damn http//www.businessinsider.com/what-a-magic-mushrooms-psilocybin-trip-is-like-- I don't think about much, at least not tonight But yes I am sensitive to touch Pretty horny Things seem a bit unreal Enjoy enjoying food Not so good at watching movies Easily entertained  Any specific SRP in min d ? I know you didn't experience the hallucinations and stuff like that but I fear if I try it then the extreme anxiety and depression will overcome me And that I'll have a bad trip Sometimes you should just set your phone aside and think in bed It's a really good exercise Yes like Shawn and Steven. Also all of those medical SRPs Why don't you ever get any female condoms from SAAF I wonder how often safe sex advocates actually have sex  Like Hannah and Xóchitl and Sarah Or like people who work at planned parenthood For the two besides Hannah, apparently more than the average basis girl by far I only went there once lol, I'll do it suppose. Didn't know you were so motivated  If that's your mindset you probably should never do it because a mindset like that forecasts disaster LOL Emily Davis put currently salvating instead of salivating with a snap of In-n-out. She ain't jes u s The average basis girl lol. It seems like a very small percentage for the girls in my grade. Your grade has all the horny people. Yes! after reading Hannah's SRP blog I think you should totally take advantage of your resources Well I think when I'm actually confronted with the shrooms itself then I won't be like that Lol using the thousand island dressing to heal some wounds Maybe she's salving her soul with delicious burgers  http//www.cnn.com/videos/world////pkg-ripley-japan-biracial-beauty-queen.cnn# Does not compute. I have been looking for a video of a black person with an asian accent and I finally found it What percent of your grade has lost it? Do you know? I may go to sleep any moment now Preemptive goodnig h t Wowww. She doesn't even look Japanese That's really cool though. You always think of interesting things to search hahahaha. Approximately % a lot of people in my grade have had sex with each other What if you include the almost sex bj people I would imagine nearly %, no ? ? Almost sex only includes three more / So that's % Maybe  With your grade I could count at least  Anyway goodnight b 🐝🐝🐝 Buzz buzz https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Z_VkdXI AP Lit? That was damn good Well made Would have been better if I knew the plot of Macbe t h I was so proud of that film lol. We had the best and funniest in the class. Shawn and I did all of the filming on my iPad. Yeah AP lit. Tbh I don't even know the plot of Macbeth Why did I ever think that hair was okay It made me look like a chipmunk  Yes it looks sooooo bad Lol for Shawn it wasn't fiction, it was a reenactmen t   God, I had the worst breakfast ever So I had one of those evol egg white with kale, roasted tomato, and goat cheese breakfast sandwiches but the bread got all soggy and it kept dripping everywhere  Soggy bread = the worst And then I'm drinking this smoothie that's basically % kale and then % cherries and blueberries and stuff, but the kale tastes awful. Especially with soy milk. I want to barf Lol I thought that too when I was watching it today Do you keep up with business/economics news? Look up this restaurant Wilko We should go there for brunch Pulverized Kale You said it would be good tasting lol Was it like frozen and you heated it? I sometimes follow that news I know Wilko lol Isn't it HELLA $$$ th o ? Lol well all my smoothies had a bit of kale. Never as much as I put in today. Yes it was but that's what the instructions said Actually you're right. Also there's a lot of bacon and sausage. Where were you thinking of going? http//m.huffpost.com/us/entry/?ncid=newsltushpmg https//news.vice.com/article/fair-trade-free-markets-and-the-bitter-fight-behind-your-morning-cup-of-coffee?ncid=newsltushpmg Well I was thinking about one of the breakfast chains but blue willow could also be cool He looks so Russian 
 I never trusted those certifications, like organic, so I never choose them over the normal opti o n Blue Willow sounds awesome. Idk if you also thought this, but I thought the host of This American Life was gay But then yesterday when billings was talking about him she said he wasn't My mom refuses to buy any coffee or tea without a Fair Trade label And she also boycotts Starbucks I need your help with making a film It's due the th He isn't... He sounds gay though Yeah he's married to a wom a n
Basically I'm going to film a bunch of trophies and AP prep books and my schedule and stuff. Then I realize I'm not happy with that life and I decide to go outside and do some yoga and go running. Then I'm going to post a video of walking down the Grand Canyon. In the background I'm going to to have some yoga music and I'm going to have a voiceover about how sometimes we need to get out and stop worrying about expectations and live for ourselves  They are the straight couple that kinda look like lesbians though ( )  /attachment.jp e g This was the assignment We want you to tell your Grand Canyon story in a creative format such as a video, photo collage, poem, story, interpretive dance, sketch or any other method that you choose And if I win I get $ So I was watching my Macmeth video today for inspiration Lol Hahahah ok! I would love to That sounds fun as he l l Oh you're right. They do look like a lesbian couple hahaha. His voice makes him sound sooo gay. He's really cute. What is your problem with NPR? I remember you said you didn't like it Okay cool. If you want to come over later that'd be great I'll give you some of the prize money for helping. Or maybe we can go somewhere cool. That's a very flattering and old photo of him. Here is a better one Actually I take that back Total silver fox Here's an old photo of him  ( )  /attachment.jpeg I don't like the tilt of their political shows Eh I don't care for the $ Well I have a bass lesson at  So I mean like I could to you r s He looks so much better now than he did then lol. Because they're liberal?? I think that NPR does a great job of giving people opportunities to share their opinions and stories Yeah I meant to my house Just the political shows not the othe r s But like we would go to a park or something I don't think it's even the liberal slant. More that they make it a goal to feed liberal guilt in anyway possible Make every situation into a cause celeb r é Well you could say the same about This American Life too, with the exploitation and conditions segments... I think it's necessary when trying to get people informed about life outside of their little bubble. No, not if it is a public entity. That is unacceptable To me You need to objective and as factually accurate as possible if you are operating publically You know At UHS they take their APs at Santa Rita ? ? Well it's almost impossible to remain objective if they're going to give people the airtime to talk about things, even if there are opposing views. Lol this year we had a few students taking their APs at basis Probably homeschooled though I'm so grateful that get to take our APs for free *we get But there aren't opposing views for the most part, and if there are, one is almost always presented in a negative light and receivers far less airti m e Can you see this 👩‍❤️💋‍👩💏🙏🏾☝🏽👌🏽💪🏽👐🏿👐🏾👊🏾👂👂🏽🙌🏻👸🏾 What does it me a n What do you see 👩‍❤️💋‍👩💏🙏🏾☝🏽👌🏽💪🏽👐🏿👐🏾👊🏾👂👂🏽🙌🏻👸🏾 Should I come over around  or  s o But don't you think that for the most part the view that gets the most airtime and is portrayed in a positive light is generally morally and socially acceptable, for a good reason? Well do you see different colored emojis But they are making that decision for you. This is a repetition more or less of yesterday's discussion but you switched sides? Different colore d ? I got the update ( )  /attachment.PNG Oh no they all look white to me ( )  /attachment.p n g Well I'm not saying we should be subjective but I can understand why NPR does what it does Why Diviya was confused  ( )  /attachment.p n g Apple is so stupid. Why make an update when only the updated devices can see it. 
 sounds good Can you see the Israeli flag 🇮🇱 No It appears like this ( )  /attachment.p n g Lol what is this? I just watched it right now Lol so it is just a guy who is so black that you can't see the features of his face in that lighting I think he is Ethiopian-Israeli Hey when is this video due Today is just not convenient for me /, would be a lot better to just meet you at the movie after bass Holy fuck, just read about this cystic fibrosis drug that costs $K/year Do you remember what Diviya said about the Unidas girl that died of cance r ? Lol yes I gathered that much from watching it but I thought there was some significance or he was some famous person. That's okay. The video is due the th. I'm planning on filming a bit in Phoenix. ( that's terrible. Link? Kinda, why? Wasn't her name Kelsey? And I think Diviya said she was kinda bitchy Omg you need to listen to the last segment of the latest This American Life, even though it was pretty bad. The attitude is just ridiculous Yeah that's what I thought she said. Just wanted to make sure Oh shit that is so soon Eh the article wasn't about that, it just mentioned the price.  Yeah I'll chug through it today I started it and don't like it so far I just don't like superheroe s   I know... I'm going to have to plan out exactly what I need if I want to get it done and edited in time. Also I have to write the voiceover script today. I came to that conclusion too after finishing it. Then when it go to the comic book part I was bored out of my mind and now I'm listening to stuff you missed in history class.

The article was informative and precise. They even addressed how Basis officials were determined to find discrepancies in the data lol. Hahah you're okay with rats but not roaches Oh I just saw the twe e t Why didn't you take care of the roaches, hmmmm 🌿 is so beautiful. Like instead of using the word we send a very aesthetically pleasing emoji. So what is the final plan tonig h t Reyna is picking me up at  So basically nobody is here lol. I am here Where u  a t Inside   ,   You need to open the snap Seriousl  Seriously Ok Sorry my phone was dead You look abuses Abus e d Did you know I save our movie tickets I think the loft tickets are so cute Quite literally. I've never had bruises from sex that hurt until now. It burns to the touch 
There is something I have thought about for the longest time and it might be a bit weird. Like all the time I feel comfortable and inseparable and connected and I want to tell you I love you because I feel like it's right, but it is unnerving.  ) I would not want you to think I am only saying it to say it, then you think I am not serious, because I would be.  ) It seems preferable to say it and hear it back, but I feel incapable of acquiring your love. Also, you are weird about public declarations and discussing feelings.  ) I am not really sure what constitutes love and it could feel different for both of us, but I know how I feel for you.  Anyway idk, goodnight Sorry I spaced out That is really cute The tickets And I'm sorry it burns That's how I feel, that I'm not sure what constitutes love. Sorry I left you hanging at the most inopportune moment But I do feel very connected to you And I don't know what I would do without you Goodnig h t It's so stupid because I'm crying and I don't know why Like I just can't even explain anything And this isn't a self pity thing but idk It's so inopportune because I should be asleep lol Anyway I'm sorry and goodnight. Oh my god today was like a movie Last night I was up until  am and I couldn't fall asleep and I felt shitty. My body was aching everywhere Then I had this dream I was late for my language AP AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED I was actually late for the exam What happened? ! ? And Wohlford and Toews and Amanda were all at the entrance telling me to run inside and Wohlford and I had to run and she was like you were supposed to be here at  I'm so upset with you, stop laughing this isn't funny And she was like The exam already started you are holding up the entire room!!! And when I got in the test literally hadn't even started I never understand running short distances. It saved like maybe one minute. Pretty pointless Why did you laugh tho You nervously laugh hardcore, b I am at sko o l So am I and I'm done w APs sooo  Literally I missed a few bubbles on the answer sheet and they hadn't started yet I really think it was the nervous laugh and I thought she was half joking Congrats! No more Hello what score do you predict for La n g Well I actually still have to take seminar / Probably a  actually. The essays were great because I am the best at them, but I couldn't finish the multiple choice!!!! Also it took me so long to read the passages What have you gotten on past APs? I always forget semin a r Lol I don't think my previous AP scores foreshadow the scores this year So I'm going to avoid answering that question hahah It was just an unrelated question But  o k How was your day today What do you think about the NSA listening in on personal calls Also after doing some research I'm more for independent Bernie Sanders Connolly and I drew this together  ( )  /attachment.jpg ( )  /attachment.JPG Isn't it so psychedelic  That is super awesome looking. The middle one's feathers look like fingers Not a fan of NSA doing anything Why hi m ? Hey Idk I like his progressive and social measures even if I don't agree w gun control and immigration stances completely What's up Hi sorry My phone was dead Oh actually jk lol you just texted me a couple minutes ago I  am glee-ing as always wbu My youngest cousin says happy birthday to my d a d My phone also just died rn but I was asleep. I had a dream your grade was doing a senior prank and you didn't want to do it, but the school siphoned gas from your car so you could t leave and you were super pissed.  What time are you coming tomorrow? CPS is coming in the morning... Bc my mom is so inconsiderate and decided to have them come when I literally told her I couldn't Also that is super cute! I love that age but without the mess and crying lol Omg Rebecca posted this picture that said  APs done, never again and I was like, holy shit,  APs in junior year!!! Then I realized she meant cumulative lol Did your family do something today for your dad's birthday? I think I'll come around ? 
 maybe Why did she call them this time we made him breakfast in b e(d )  /attachment.JPG Am I rich yet? Fuck that's when the lady is coming... Can we make it ? As long as we leave for Phoenix before noon I think Or around noon I don't know why she calls them if not to start problems That's really cute! 
I mean yeah but if you think about it I need to pick up you and Nate and Diviya and go to the other side of town, eat at a sit down restaurant and drive back across town... We could do it but it would be rushed. Why do you need to be at home?  Bitch you were rich the entire ti m e I already told my mom I couldn't meet with the lady and she was like eh, your friends can wait This is important I think the sperry look w rolled up pant legs is sexy Super sexy You know, CPS is often not on time, too... Well either way I'm heading to that side to pick up nate so I'll come by around  and if you are done, great, and if not... Idk .   Okay Madeleine said we can leave for Phoenix around  O k If not I'll leave anyway, lol I mean still though what if COS is late Oh ok So I'll come by when I come by and you'll just come Ok but if your mom says no I'm sure you won't arg u e Mmm okay so here is my plan. If the meeting isn't over by  then I just won't go to brunch or I'll meet you guys there or wherever you are going afterwards. I will let you know before you get Nate. Literally a CPS meeting is the most inconvenient thing You know they came to the school last year and pulled me out of euro That's probably why I got a , hmph  Ok, I would love for you to come to the brunch and I hope you d o   ^there's / of an answer to your ap question haha What are CPS meetings like Lol I was just thinking th a t I really want to go because we have been talking about going there for the longest time, damn it. I mean even if I come late I can get yogurt and granola or something light since I might eat before. 
Well their main focus is abuse and abuse-oriented discussion. They ask about methods of punishment I have had throughout my life and about a lot of safety stuff. Then they ask questions about my social life. And then, the weird thing is that I never hear from them again. Did you parents ever spank you or like what did they do? I remember bleeding from my lip because I got slapped in the face ( do you think that experience stuff like that as a child impacts me later in life? Like I mean sure there's the memory but what do you think I think it makes me more sensitive to seeing other children and it makes me repulsed to the idea of parenthood because I wouldn't want a child experiencing the same thing  Also I think it makes me more caring for Alex 
Interesting really, but I didn't pay attention in euro class all year. By the time my academic change kicked in I only had about a week to study and essays are always my strongest, so I think that's what saved me because I didn't know a lot of specifics and could bs the essays but not MC. They spanked me and then they regretted it because I spanked them back So after like age  they didn't spank And no not really as long as it isn't extreme Honestly I don't think there is anything wrong with spanking as long as it is accompanied with strong parenting otherwise Bleeding from your lip is a whole other level I am drinking a dos Equis and I am happy This beer actually tastes very decent and I can't taste the alcohol I am becoming a college kid... fu c k You spanked them back...? Hahaha what?! You have to explain. My spankings were with a belt, multiple times at once. I'm not against spanking but I am against excess. Lol I also enjoy dos equis and I am not a college kid Drinking beer makes me feel patriotic and relevant It's just really smooth and I love the hips beers with subtle flavors like citrus The best drinks are drinks when you can't even taste the alcohol. I miss V's summer bartending skills. How did your parents agree to let you drink one I mean they would hit me and I would say f that and hit them back (lightly) when they irritated me 
 ,  Yeah no not with a belt!!! Just a hand. It wasn't even with much force God yes Like the Grapefruit drinks I was just like hey do you want to split a beer mom And she was like ok And so she got a bit and I got most of it You got drunk with your mom, bish You know I didn't think colleges I visited were that liberal and Diviya said I was delusional and then I remembered that at every club you start by saying your name and your pronouns... It's like an actual thing I had a chick from India trying to explain it to me while I internally laughed 
There is this tumblr dedicated to the experiences of FTM guys on grindr and they are such stuck up assholes. Whenever people ask them questions they get so offended, like shit, fuck you for complimenting on a hookup app or wanting a few specifics before banging someone. Like they won't even answer what surgery they have Alright well goodnig h t Hi sorry I'm not asleep My grandpa was talking to me 
lol yeah I don't know how you didn't know about how liberal colleges are. All of the college students I follow on tumblr are always complaining about representation and always posting about the most SJW events known to man. Even at ASU there's that community. Oh can you send the link! ( )  /attachment.PNG What I don't get are the obvious pronouns  Like he's gay and his name is Zach, why does he need to put he/his A washed and blow dried cow ( )  /attachment.png Alright well you are probably asleep haha so goodnight! See you tomorrow 💕 A life goal http//onlythefearlessarefree.tumblr.com/post//popejohnsmith-enjoying-pole http//lickmyvixx.tumblr.com/post//demongirlblaze-i-made-this-for-my-informative http//t-stroke.tumblr.com/post//skyleroakley-short-one-i-needed-to-brush-my This looks like yours  http//transmenongrindr.tumblr.com/ The first couple are pretty legitimately ridiculous but after that they are bitches Have seen dat cow but love it Zach is probably ftm if he lists pronou n s Bradford also lists pronouns lol That warms my heart 💗 it's such a beautiful one too. We're here, we're queer, and we're on grindr and it's literally titled Transn on Grindr You don't think some of that is offensive? Some, yes. Others, no Lol probably at his sister's behest but point tak e n I think the way some people phrase their questions is not all that appropriate Also CPS isn't here yet... Last night all I did was hang clothes and listen to Adam Lambert and Lana ( )  /attachment.JPG I might meet you guys there or see you after Ok, I'll still text when I'm in the area to make su r e Ohhhh wait I'm an hour ahead I love lambert's look but hate his music l o l I was wondering why she wasn't here yet Yes it is  Yeah. . . Lol ok nvm then I just woke up so early and I didn't sleep and my schedule is so fucked CPS cancelled HAHAHAHAHA  Ok I'll pick you up th e n After Nate though please My mom got super pissed at me and we got into this huge argument Ok why is she angry t h o I'll explain later Come out bi s h Park in front
 ,  H(i )  /attachment.jpg What are you guys talking about???

Or if I'm not at school then to pick me up from home http//losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/cas/.html lol 
 I can but I am busy at  unless you want to come voluntee r   Watch this before your presentation and feel good  https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=Flf-JmYnXNg Where are you volunteering? 
  attachment.PDF Also look at this movie night I got invited to, lol What does Viagra do for females That's depressing as fuck SAAG SAAF Whoops it's already over. Will check the video out when I get home Mm I think it is just a vasodilator for females Good for hea r t It's hosted by a cemetery lol... I kn o w How did it go? And how were the others? I had two dreams about you  ) We met like  years later at some airport and we were both with our significant others. Through lunch we realized how bad the relationships were and we left to go fuck in a bathroom while the others did the same 
) you came to the school because you wanted to go out to lunch with me and pick me up, but you hadn't told me yet. I was talking to Jennifer when you came so you talked to Martha right next to me. I hadn't seen you yet but when I walked over to the Zayna group you decided to not even bother. Then you found some other random gay and went with him. 
Also in my dreams there were weird interludes. I went to some spooky birthday party and there were brains in some box. And then another one was that I turned the oven on and accidentally left a bunch of things inside, so I had to go inside and clean it while it was still hot. ( )  /attachment.png It went well and the others were super cool Why the beyonce Your two dreams sound like opposites http//mobile.nytimes.com////magazine/the-underground-art-of-the-insult.html?_ r =
Maybe this explains why Madeleine, white but yet still marginalized, is sassy. I actually don't really buy this article. I think they're forcing relations to race and oppression to explain something almost universal to all people. And how would one explain sass in someone who is growing up now and doesn't have to overcome social adversity? That's great!!! What are you doing today? Also are you going to the loft tomorrow Beyoncé to share the fine details of the dress. And the body lol I really think shade is about rivalry with people of a similar status (A Google search for the words Cookie, Empire, and shade results in almost half a million hits.) Those last three lines are super passive aggressive, damn. https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=alkPiiHndE Lol I forgot graduation is on Wednesd a y Oops lol, never mind then I'm sorry I think it's about how it would originate in the oppressed not about how it is about oppression in  Like its a popular trend for all now I am not doing anything today Movie today or tomorrow whatever I love the hamster Did you check out the Craigslist link 
I saw a thing that said that the israeli Palestinian conflict is like an uncircumcised penis because when you finally think it's done it is just all up in your face again or something. Don't get why it must be uncircumcise d   Using uncircumcised is shade, don't you get it P But really though I don't get that either. Bad analogy. You're going to watch a movie today? No, basically I want to have you free on an evening because I want to have a picnic with you Also the loft not your usual bedtime story screening is tomorrow at am Yes hahaha. Do you find yourself getting more turned on by the advertisement itself than the pic That's what I felt Reyna messaged me right as I got home yesterday and asked if I wanted to go out. I could barely type my response because I was already falling asleep. Oh ok that is cool too yeah I will go to div's thing tomorrow Absolutely lol. But it wasn't really that I was turned on, I just found it so over the top. I am sure the guy isn't actually attractive if that's the best photo he can muster lol  Did you respo n d Yeah I did haha. Also I accidentally called Panteha over Facebook messenger because I couldn't see clearly when I woke up last night. Do you want to know something sad The preschool my brother graduated from is unable to provide scholarships to many families next year (it was cut by %) due to decreases in the Tobacco Tax income which supplied funds for the scholarships the preschool is relatively inexpensive and the primary demographic is low income families. Many of the parents look like tobacco users or heavy drug users. I just found that interesting This is why we need legal we e d What do you find so appealing about the craigslist ads? Is it that It is a real person  It's like erotica tailored towards m e n So I need to know about picnic in advance, I'll let Diviya know, and we should also see a movie this week Is Reyna free tonight It would be fun to ha n g I'll be free around  tonight I think How would legal weed help when the scholarship is funded by tobacco tax lol Weed tax to repla c e It must feel nice when you find ads that are relevant to you and the guy describes you It already looks kinda bad that their funds are dependent on tobacco tax, I couldn't imagine weed tax No it looks good for weed It is the case in Colorado All the weed tax goes to education  Who cares what pays for new scholarships as long as they have them .   Hi sorry I was in the shower, for literally almost an hour. I actually didn't know that though Reyna says maybe and James is also a maybe Why the sudden Reyna obsession hmmmmm? Is it so you can interview her about Elliot to get more evidence lol Oh you just brought her up Do you think people with intellectual disabilities can consent? Does it matter if the partner is disabled? Where do we draw the line, there are some obviously not able to consent cases but where does it end?  And if an individual can't consent can they be held accountable for rape, given that we are saying they can't understand se x ? Suuuuuuuuuuure. Well Reyna says count her out. 
I think if it's to the point where one isn't able to function in society and has a trend of making abnormal decision, sex should not be a concern. they shouldn't be fit to have sex and nobody should try to instigate it with them unless the person is instigating it themselves under those conditions. But like I've heard of elderly couples where one has dementia And the other was accused of sexual harassment because the one with dementia couldn't consent In those cases I just think the one with dementia is unfit for sex I don't think it's right to charge for sexual harassment at all though, especially if they're married How do you feel My shave gel smells like you ) Can we still go even tho Reyna can't What shave gel is it Ya what do you want to do I don't really have an answer  
I think for me personally if there was someone with intelligence comparable to that of Down's Syndrome that it would be wrong of me to do them. But I guess they could be able to understand what is going on so they could consent. It's trick y . Oh! Lost River is playing at  and we can do coffee and taboo before. I think it's a Gillette What's lost River abo u t
Yeah but I guess we don't really know how capable they are of understanding. It's different for each case so it's best to play it safe. I guess there are so many people in the world that you could have sex with someone else It's the Ryan gosling film Taxi driver? Your choice, just wanted to mention it is on a t   Does lost river look unappealing? Maybe but I'll probably fall asleep during the movie hahah Doesn't it make you uncomfortable to watch videos or movies or shows on your phone No it doesn't sound bad. I'll  watch the trailer again. What time is it at again Mm I think it is lesser but I am not uncomfortable As you sent that I was watching glee on my phone (not a common occurrenc e ) Omg I'm at a dinner fundraiser and I thought some kid said I'm being oppressed! And I burst out laughing and then he was like I said I'm being depressed... It's at  I think subtitles on phones make me uncomfortable Hahahahah I have three stories to tell you.  Actually tonight won't work for me, I'm too tired. Alright I understand  Sorry btw I spaced I anticipate your three stories at a later ti m e Yeah it's fine I'm sorry I've been super unresponsive I just feel like shit and my head hurts. I'm really really sick 😕 I think once I get home I'm going to go to sleep How has your day been Glee all day? Or did you complete a task in your list? I had forgotten about a senior party So I'm at that Other than that, gl e e Like a legit senior party? Or is it clean? Clean but I think there is an after par t y Oh are you gonna go to that Guess  s o Cool alright then Have fun Sunday  ,   How is it Just got here idk y e t I had meant in general but ok Oh Haley's mom is he r e Is her mom one of the Diviya moms except that she stays lol Does that usually happen Ya 
 I lost at beer pong I have had like  beers and a sho t   Ouch I guess your Dartmouth and brown skills didn't pay off How does that make you feel hmm Who won? It's literally been like  min lol I can't believe you've already had that much I guess beers are smooth and it's kinda like drinking water Isn't this so trashy ( )  /attachment.PNG He's in like th grade Fuck I am drunk Yuan bin won Who is  h e YUAN BIN?!!!!! No fucking way Aimee I swear you're lying to me Wow, damn. Go him. I never knew that was his deal. Apparently he does have this secret mad party life He's my boo Or maybe yuan bin has been to things before and you just never mentioned it Any other surprises? Does Mackenzie drink? Also I'm sorry I feel like I've been bothering you all day No she doesn't You aren't bothering me H i Hi hahah Are you okay Saskia posted this picture of Hailey signing shawn's booty What's going on now I did not witness that I am fine All is well I feel so great Alex Ellinwood is here Apparently he needs to go to the Russian dra f t Well that's good. Are you 🌿🌿🌿 I didn't know he knew any seniors. He looks . But being drafted has always been one of my top  fears Like it physically makes me sick to think about and I start shaking When does he have to go? Ugh, I think the situation is so unfortunate. I'm sure a majority of american Russians wish they weren't even associated with Russia in a militaristic sense right now I am now He is a family friend of Caitlin I think He doesn't have to go He just has to sign up like selective servi c e So is he a dual citizen or just Russian? Idk I'm a hipst e r No you ain't bitch you only know like  Lana song Caitlin descibed me as hipste r   I remember when I first heard hipster in speech and I thought it was some dance move where you shake your hips She didn't know I was ne a r What was the context I've spent the past hour listening to old Amy Winehouse it's the shit Oh I first heard the word hipster in some Mac Miller song Gloria showed me What are some of your biggest fears Aside from the draft, I fear addiction to drugs or alcohol. Being inferior Becoming dumber  We all joked at your hipster dance Gloria   < Being inferior and dumber to whom? Any large grou p   Lol was Gloria < a sarcastic text That's fair. Not my biggest fear because it's something you can escape My biggest fears (draft, addiction) are difficult to leave  The ones that take ahold of you or are forceful  Omg do you remember when Courtney love said nigger? Diviya and I got on the ground and said hands up don't shoot and we didn't go to ferguson for this shit Charlotte has no gag reflex she says Hahahahahaha y e s But is that like actually preferable I am neutr a l Challenge her to suck off a Popsicle and prove it Or better yet Suck off a guy right now and then hear his review lol  You can be teletubies and beat Reza up and you can be la la and you can be dipsy wispy. He has a pimpin Dalmatian hat and he's kinda gay -Mal e c Fucked up people are literally more difficult to comprehend than physics lol  I'm not sure if I should ask for an explanation And more importantly I'm not even sure if you can explain it yourself haha ) I kinda want an explanation though so if you're ready shoot for it He was angry at reza And likes the teletubbi e s Hahahah Well mister i have to get up kinda early for that film tomorrow at the loft. I'll see you later, have fun and stay safe. Goodnight ❤️ FU C K ? U ok? Ya It's just ear l y Oh, yeah. Kinda. If you can't go I understand. Gil has received cranium  Wish you came to these so we could tag te a m He received cranium the board game? Lol nobody told me about cranium how would I know Those were two separate statemen t s Tag team in what? You mean in terms of sex ? Tag team in call of duty How long is the sex Ed vid e o I'm not sure Are you coming  What happen e d It was kinda scary because at first I was alone in the house and I could see him in the backyard and he looked kinda disconcerted But then he asked me if I wanted to give the dog a bath In the end it's not really his call and it's my life I was really nervous though You know the why do we need professors NYT article was really insightful It talked about how on a s and s college survey approx. % of students wanted to get a different perspective on life and many students had intellectual discussions with professors and used them as resources When now the % answer is that students want a successful job and a good paycheck and around % of students meet with professors and only attend classes but don't scrutinize the material That's also due to teachers focusing on their individual research as well and they might not always have time But it was an interesting education experience shift *% never talk to professors outside of class http//mobile.nytimes.com////opinion/sunday/whats-the-point-of-a-professor.html?referrer=&_r= Received cranium I love that phrase hahaha Honestly I think it is missing the obvious reason 
That back then college was for the wealthy and privileged who would have had jobs no matter what, and the world has just changed. And so of course they had lofty reasons for education. Now it has expanded to all as a means for upward mobility.  I bet those upper class students still see it as a way to grow now.  It's simply a matter of the expansion of the institution beyond those striving to enter academia or other upper echelo n s
Yes!!! That is literally the best response. I was going to say that along with the inundation of students not in the upper classes came the idea that college is primarily for social advancement and eventually doing something profitable. But I don't think someone like you or Charlotte or the wealthiest people will even attempt to dive into material, and really money is the language of success these days. I think it's rare to further your education because people who do end up becoming researchers or professors themselves unless you have a job secured. It's just kinda unfortunate because the concept is even prevalent in our high school, where only Jay and Joseph take advantage of Rosinbum or Connolly other very intelligent people and challenge their views, and other students focus on the grade and the goal to get them into college. Like it's unnecessarily instilled in high school and I think teachers should make more advances and show students that they want to have discussions and they want to share books, like Connolly and Rosinbum do Because I think all of us can be fairly successful in life and have decent grades in college if intellectual expansion is the risk Wait so you are saying you don't think wealthy people are doing it for personal expansion either? Wait do you mean it is the risk What* Well, you know some people just don't like literature or philosophy (me) Not everyone has to strive to be that kind of intellectu a l I'm saying to some extent they do but the culture today depends on profit and salary 
That we can engage in those discussions and not slave ourselves to the routine and classes. Occasionally get out of our comfort zone and chat with our professors. It's not going to cost us a grade. Like I'm basically saying it's kinda silly not to use our professors because there isn't a risk, except wasted time. And that certainly isn't the only type of intellectual. I love talking to Billings about history on a personal level and asking things I would have been afraid to ask in class. It doesn't depend on that for those that don't need to work for a living And those are the people I'm talking about, the old inherited money I think and hope that many will break out of their shy shells in college. It is far too early to write them o f f So then do you think they get the most out of an elite or university education? Rather than anybody else? They are most able to get the most out of it but often don't I would say.  The ones who aren't wealthy and want to succeed in humanities push themselves more to succeed  And even if it doesn't make $ sense to go to an elite university for humanities, tons and tons of people with and without money do it anyway. So, in theory, yes, in practice, eh. Well some students just aren't into that and engage in their own ways I just think that you are making it out that your way is THE way. Sure I don't think Rainy is right at all in her way, but Helena might be.  
And you have to remember that each person is just that-- a person. Multifaceted even if it isn't clear. You can't reduce them to pawns in an argument like that. I assure you that Holly has thoughts that don't involve her career, she just doesn't express them to you and I often.  Sorry that was unnecessarily harsh  Idk today I really saw Diviya's way in a new light And Martha's. And it inspired me.  I think there is a quiet beauty to their ways. 
And how Diviya does all of this really because she doesn't know what else to do with herself. It is her life. I need to make my work my life, because I can never be the winner without falling in love with what I study and do, like her .  
I'm not saying my way is THE way. The thing I am pushing for is for people to explore the material they are studying, which in college largely pertains to your interests and classes germane to your career, which is why I can't understand why you're attacking me! If anything, I'm saying that you should strive to make your interests what's important. I like history and I go to billings and read the textbook and read about civil rights and salutary neglect because I love it and I want to incorporate history into my career somehow. You think I don't see the beauty of Diviya's ways? She is literally one of the people who inspired me to work harder. Sure I think she neglects herself some social time when school is her top priority, but I admire her dedication and affinities. I just think that in college it is all so high level that there is no choice to not explore the material It's true in high school, sure, and at the U of Arizona or other average schools, but not among the eli t e
Yes, definitely at the elite colleges are you given the opportunity to do so, where you are literally taking no gen eds ( the course load makes it significantly more difficult to explore material because on top of that you have to balance everything, unless you use AP credits How are gen ed classes working for you actually? at brown Do you just not take them? Open curriculum No gen eds. % free choice of classes .   FUCK Ok let me just say the other ivies have a shitton of required cours e s that's so good, damn That's why I chose Brown Ok but gen eds aren't necessarily a bad word  If you have a variety of interests you can take awesome courses that count for gen Ed Actually they mostly just have requirements of areas-- not courses. But still it is a lot. Especially Columbia, fuck. Like you don't have to take chemistry  but you have to take a chemistry Actually tho since I am doing pre med I might as well have gen eds So many requirements 
 year general chemistry,  year organic chemistry,  year biology,  year physics (FUCK MY LYFEEEEE),  year ENGLISH,  semester math, and now they are adding behavioral science and humanities for next year So I might as well have gone somewhere with distributions. Fuck prem e d Hahahah those requirements are literally classes you would be taking elsewhere. At least you don't have to take them every year so you are kinda lucky. Do you know any other schools that offer open curriculum? Also do you plan on going to brown med school? And why would English and a humanities be required?? Sorry though I was eating dinner and brewing some tea You know Xóchitl never really engaged in class but she is obviously an interesting pers o n I hate engaging in class Groups freak me out and I only function well with one on one or small groups But I see your point Do you know what she wants to do? Yes! Amherst, Wesleyan, Grinnell And Williams has like very few small requiremen t s Lol schools I can get into pls Sarah Lawrence I think Grinnell you have a shot at And Sarah Lawrence for sure  Even Wesleyan I believe is within the range of possibility. Steven got in  I hate groups too But I meant like xochi didn't really talk to teachers or like anything No I do not plan on going to their med school, it isn't very good And would be $$$ I think she wants to do robotics or engineering of some kind Idk why it is required How is the tea I am going to finish this book And The Band Played On  this week You might like it. It is very long but it is very interesting. The gay politics of the 's can be felt today. It's a history book, really. I think it exemplifies what I love about the fie l d Literally I was going to ask to read the book this week because I thought you would never get around to it That is such a crazy coincidence Looking into Sarah Lawrence I think that's where I have the best chance  Where do you plan on going to med school? Question Did your passion for AIDS stem from a desire to find a lucrative career and go to med school or is it something you were passionate about regardless of money? Bc most of my interests don't depend on money Really though I feel like I want a very comfortable life and it would be nice What sparked the change from economist to epidemiologist  I took Post-AP Econ and realized I was idealizing things.  And that I don't actually enjoy the material.  And it was all passion The one money consideration was that I shifted from wanting to be a PhD researcher to an MD. But also I think researchers mostly do grants so it was a passion decision too That's so weird  I'm thinking either U of Arizona (which I'm perfectly happy with) or UCSF or Emory if my grades and MCAT are great.    ,   Fuck I feel like shit I'm sorry I've been napping You're right about Madeleine. She's literally a giant ball of fury and irascibility  Wouldn't PhD researcher be more beneficial for society though...? What would you be doing as an MD Something that kinda upsets me sometimes is when everyone complains they have the worst life ever and they make life shitty for others because of this reason That's what she reminds me of When like literally I can topple her town w all the shit I went through the past  months *down Although we all deal with things differently and I definitely shouldnt discredit her struggle http//mobile.nytimes.com////upshot/the-in-state-tuition-break-slowly-disappearing.html?_r= Ok I still overall like Madeleine lol I don't think she is a ball of fury. She just needs to take a chill pill or . Yes it would be more beneficial probably but I'm not basing my decision on that. I'm already going to benefit society and I'm not going to be sad and poor because I chose to help society that extra little bit What happened to cause you to be upset with Madeleine http//www.sltrib.com/opinion/-/op-ed-lds-church-influence-drives-mistreatment One small example of the undue influence of the LDS church in Utah. http//mobile.nytimes.com////movies/eight.html?referrer= http//m.huffpost.com/us/entry/ http//mobile.nytimes.com////us/politics/marriage.html?pagewanted=all&referrer= You don't have to read all of them, it is just many sources to vouch for accuracy The church itself should not solicit donations for such a political cause nor should it encourage its members to contribute to a cause that is in another state. This is one of the many things about the church. #hatethechurchlovethe churcher #hatethechurchlovethe sinn e r Good morning. I just woke up and had the coolest dream kinda involving a church not really though 
Basically I was swimming in the Colorado river and trying to escape my dad's family who wanted to impose Muslim law in the workplace. I had to climb rocks and waterfalls to get back to society and warn them about the plan, which involved breaking into some house when they were already inside the house and sneaking out of windows Anyway I made it to society and had to protest with people getting off of busses because the Muslim law wanted to ban public transportation. People were spraying pepper spray at the passengers and stuff Then all of a sudden I ran into Rihanna and had to stop to take a selfie  But there were other dreams too where Keizer said he liked me and I kept ignoring him and didn't make him a Valentine's, but I made one for Kristie. And then some dream where you were able to intercept all of my messages and join all of my group chats and you got upset with me for some reason I'll reSd yore things in a min Hi Those are some weird drea m s Hey sorry I'm reading the first article right now. There's a limit on the amount of students allowed to pay in-state tuition??! Glad that dream-you has his priorities straig h t Oh they balance it out by lowering in state and increasing out of state Honestly though I think that's the best way to go But I guess I'm just saying that because I'm guaranteed financial aid I was upset because Martha showed me the texts Madeleine sent her and they were excessively bitchy  Well that's because Arizona doesn't do that, they accept many many in state students with a high rate of admission. The same cannot be said for other states Any quote s ? How exactly does the church bolster itself in industries it has no business in? Like I get the motive for prohibition but what makes them so powerful that board members take their opinions into consideration? Is it all financial based? No not at all The entire state of Utah is mormon. They think that the church leadership literally speaks to God. So if you go against them you are literally going against god's wishes The board members are probably mormon Idk if you caught the line that said that they should have some people who consume alcohol on the board. They didn't before because it was % morm o n Damn the newest episode of This American Life is so good It's about values in upbringing Sex, race And tradition and how society shapes our views and stuff What are you doing today? lol did you catch the line about how having a woman is tantamount to putting a drug addict on the narcotics board Really though these articles don't taint my view on the Mormon population I know Just the church. And personally church institutions have always been flawed, not the people per se. I went to lunch with family friend And now at Diviya's are you coming? I agree. But I am upset they feed into that I'll check it o u t No I'm not How are you Sorry I was eating so I couldn't talk earlier. Wasn't  ignorin g   Well I finished the podcast and it reinforced all the reasons why I don't want kids. Baby fever and maternal/paternal desire isn't enough. I'm ok. Studying for bio and going to watch a movie. Wbu Yeah I'll check it out sounds great Do you feel prepared How did today go What movie I'm swimmi n g I'm always prepared for bio. There isn't too much to know. I thought you couldn't swim??? Today was kinda uneventful but I started a few projects and made a schedule The Spectacular Now How is your day going I can't put my chest fully in for extended periods  So I just stay with my arms on the outside Oh I want to see that What projects? It's going pretty aweso m e Started college app, finalized summer plans, made a college list, SRP stuff, and made a new appropriate email You are so on top of thin g s I've forgotten how great it was to watch a new movie And like feel things inside from the movie I only did those things because I feel like everyone else already has Diviya's mom wants Diviya to call her What things do you feel? ! ? lol why do you sound like I just admitted support for Hamas or something Oh I was just curious I am so horny SERGIO Didn't mean to capitali z e Well I was watching the movie and alongside reading roger ebert's review. It just made the experience more intense and personal for me. Oh ( Also the movie felt like my life right now And like all the things I have gone through in terms of parents and boys and school Like it captured my pre-focused and transitioning self In such a beautiful way Well I've been home all day not doing anything  Ok I'll watch it tonight ha h a I wish I went swimming damn it Oh   ( Also something funny is that the girl's name is Aimee, exactly It always bothered me hearing my name on the big screen Btw it's on Australian Netflix And btw again You are everything to me and I couldn't be happier❤️ In case you didn't know That is so strange I am so happy to be with y o u What are your plans tomorrow? My mom will be going out with some guy tomorrow and  night  I know  is grad night Are we doing a party at your place on  night Tomorrow at school  But I will have free time from like - And I think I have  plans perhaps so no  Do you want to send photos? Sorry that today didn't pan out, didn't realize you were fr e e I was going to send but I thought you were with doviya  Why are you at school tomorrow? Well I was sick last night and decided to stay home because I didn't know how I would feel In the morning I was eh but I felt better throughout the day Just got home A bit ago At school for grad pictures and D&D what symptoms have you been having   ,   Do you actually know how to play d&d?  Just fatigue and body aches and a cough I always get sick around exam/finals season though Where'd you and doviya go?? Yeah I used to play a lot  Oh We went to a hot dog place and smoked She smoked on three separate occasions today I am actually going to sleep so goodnigh t   Oh Okay well Goodnight Only bc up at am and feeling used What's  u p Finished my bio final wbu Gonna be at schools in  That you like grabbed my head and went in as far as possible and made me choke during a bj and that I almost threw up and was coughing  Ok you know The black guy on this american life actually I really disagree with h i m Which one?

N v m If you're too tired though it's okay Bc Diviya can't come with us She doesn't want to do anything fun or intense tonight I might be a little tired too though, I'm sorry. But I had lots of fun with you today! Why do you disagree with him? Aight  I'll tell you later, enjoy your par t y Hey boo What's up? What was your statement Actually Bo Ok so the angry dad g u y No tell me  I felt he went a step too f a r The one who openly rejected integration? I think the white man in America is doing very well and I have no concern for his well-being Yeah I don't think that is a constructive way to look at things Nor to generalize the white ma n Exactly that's exactly how I felt It's taking a stride away from equality Precisely 
I'm a white guy. My dad is from North Africa because his people were kicked out of the Iberian peninsula by the inquisition. My mom's family was kicked out of east Europe by antisemitic sentiment if lucky, and if unlucky killed by hitler. I am a second generation immigrant. My people have suffered immensely as well, and yes I benefit from white privilege but no I am not the descendant of any oppressor of yours, so don't generalize.  I just think his jaded view is not badass it's harmful. I just do not understand why suddenly radicalism and racism is the new progressive as long as the mouth piece isn't white 
And honestly I was disturbed that this perspective was being promoted on public radio. This is what I mean about my beef with npr. It's not that I have a problem with him expressing his view, I have a problem with the fact that the guy hosting the segment only offered him praises. It made it seem like his way was unquestionably correct.  I wasn't sure about you but then I saw how many white people got mad about what you wrote and that convinced me that you were probably alrigh t 
I really think the success of an equal society is contingent upon acknowledgement of oppression and the ability to forgive and move forward. Honestly a lot of the problems stem from the past and dwelling on the past. the number of lynchings today are substantially lower than ever before, nearly nonexistent. Raising your children with those race dichotomies is disgusting. Tell them the stories and the history, but also tell them that things are better now. Tell them that everybody overcomes adversity no matter what race or gender or whatever they are. It also disturbed me too And like when he was talking about how his daughter's response in church was natural I got really upset tell him about the church incident like it was some funny joke. So insensitive to emotions non-black (aka oppressed) people feel There really is no way to rationalize that man's behavior. He is successful and what more can he want? *his attitude 
Yes I feel the exact same way. Really he is one of many that feel this way, but most of those are young and have no impact on others. And I'm not just speaking regarding race-- this whole toxic social justice thing. What caused the spike in riots recently, I would say, is this combative sentiment, not any action or inaction on the part of any governing institutions  Honestly though, I don't think he conducts himself on a day to day basis consistently with that fiery rhetoric. His white bogeyman doesn't exist, at least not in fucking Berkeley, CA.
 ,  Ok goodnight  I'm sad that I probably won't live to see the discovery of alien civilizations. It will be truly revolutionary.  What if they have other senses The possibilities are infinite Or even crazier, what if they have massive similarities to ourselves We tend to get so self-involved in society we have created that should theoretically benefit us. It causes us so much worry. Maybe one day I will step away from that. Maybe that's what Connolly knows that we don't .   Holy shit Aimee I had the best fucking dream ever We were in the army together for  years I'm sorry though I fell asleep early but got the best sleep 
And like we got to fight a bunch of people but it was sad when we got back into civilization. Reyna and Nate were in college already and were together. All of our friends were in college except us and we were so behind on things. I was thinking about the existence of aliens earlier this week too and how there is such a high chance of things existing. I really do believe in aliens like we can't be the only things How is Connolly the one more detached from our society than say you? She is such a stereotypical person. Yoga, reads the news, watches Netflix, hosts dinner parties. Her ideas are fascinating but she is still very involved in the world. 
Aimee, God that was the best dream I've ever had. I literally went through four years in a bunker with you. And like I got raped, we had to go through boot camp, we had to save this girl who almost died, we learned how to become war machines, climb mountains. Very very very high intensity I guess there's always this fear of the unknown though. Like I'm terrified to know if there are aliens. I don't know what intellectual level they're at, what they're capable of, if they're a hostile or amicable force. your view about alien civilizations is surprisingly optimistic and I think for something like that we can't be Also in my dream I gave you head except I went inside of you and it was sparkling inside and I could walk around and move things hahah Well like how she left her PhD program cos it wasn't making her happy How did you feel about your rape I don't think us discovering them means them discovering us, and so I am optimistic  That it won't be war because they won't know we saw them Like your whole body went inside me? What did you move arou n d Oh yes! And she is one of the happiest person I know. Yesterday Diviya said that she wishes she could pursue her dreams but that she wants a comfortable lifestyle aka money. The rape actually got you more upset than I was Great differentiation! Yes my whole body. I was like pushing against the interior walls hahah Do you have an extra graduation ticket...? Sorry if it's inconvenient Yeah I think I do Sorry I was on a driving lesson That is so strange. What color was  i t It was pink and purple and sparkly haha And you were talking to me while I was inside Ok cool thanks bar Bae  That is a bit strange lol I don't think of my insides as pink and purple and spark l y When we use the glow in the dark condom I want to leave it inside of you so you're glowing Why'd you have a driving class? This morning I went to ihop w Martha, Ahmad, Diviya, and Nate, and now we're at agua caliente How are you feeling today Are you ready for graduation Lol that might be ok Wow, jealous! That sounds so fun Yeah I feel fine, don't really feel much My mom wanted me to be sure I was good on highw a y What are you doing after grad? Oh that's cool I hope it went well No idea, there might be something, idk What  u p We're hanging at Diviya's house Gonna pre game on fruity wine hahah what's up with you? Did you actually get to drive on the highway? The pink wine?

 Hi Sorry I was at breakfast with Sweeney I felt so bad this morning Well not hungover I just still feel buzzed. Which is ridiculous  Did you go to schoo l   Oh where'd you two go? Her and I and some other seniors went to bobo ' s I'm sorry b ( I feel so refreshed and I had a banana and a cup of tea No I'm probably just gonna go home at like  I'm still at Jen's And I realized That I absolutely love cats more than anything!!!! 😻😻😻 What are you up to now? What is bobo's specialty? Is it just regular breakfast food? I love cats too! I just got home so I am debating going to sleep, watching Netflix, or fucking around on my phone for a bit longer It's cheap american food A sure step up from Waffle House How was your sleepove r   But like I never understood the cat craze until this morning. I just woke up and cuddled with the cat for an hour before everyone else woke up. The best thing is falling asleep while watching Netflix And then having interesting dreams about what you just watched lol I just had salmon and Mac and cheese w artichoke and spinach The sleepover was alright. How was your party? My party was pretty great  That sounds like an... Interesting combination What Netflix you be watchi n g Hey It was a great combination! Basically Jennifer made too much food for Joseph and had to get rid of it lol Right now I am sitting outside of my house because nobody is home What did you end up doing or watching? Look at this glorious outfit  ( )  /attachment.PNG I am so relaxed What time is Reza's graduation? Oh also the salmon and the macaroni & cheese were on separate plates Hey what's u p   Lol well I finally got inside my house and I showered and helped my grandpa in the garage. I've just been lying down and thinking for a while. Wbu? I was actually thinking about the time we had perfect sex and I was about to start jerking off But my phone was accidentally put on ringer mode so Lol Lol I just woke up From a long nap And I feel shitty but not as tire d   I'm sorry about that. Are you okay enough to go to Reza's? I feel a little shitty too because of my cat allergies Also it just feels like nothing exciting has been happening with me And I don't like that feeling I'll probably see Far from the Madding Crowd tomorrow. Wow that sucks that you are allergic to cats Why that movie I think I'll go Maybe you got me sick lol I feel the same way about myse l f Well you always refuse to get near me or kiss me so idk how you got sick Jk lol. It probably was me. I know! My throat and nose are still so irritated and I was tearing up in my sleep. Ummmm Carey mulligan is in it?!!! at least I'll be busy almost all of June though so I don't feel completely useless Well have fun! Hey sorry I was in the shower I think what I am experiencing is hangover. This is unfortunate Love Carey mulligan Any plans this weeken d ? AIMEEEE I'm sorry You are awesome I think I have had one before too minus the vomiting that is supposed to happen. Do you remember most of the party last night or is it a blur? This weekend I am seeing The Room and going to Joseph's on  and then I'm free the rest of the weekend I wanted to have a picnic with you during the week Did you know that to talk to you it used to be incredibly hard for me so I would memorize some conversation starters and plan out a few subjects to talk about before we hung out Also, do you know what a majority of your grade is majoring in or like what they're interested in And what are your weekend plans? I remember some of it. Not much happened tbh Charlie McLean grew his hair out Many of them want to do engineering and many have no idea Many want biology Really? When did you become more comfortable I don't think I have plans outside of Joseph's Who is in the movie project I'm thinking it might be weird to go I am like the only white person at chol l a I knew Charlie had been growing his hair out long ago. Priscilla kept me updated on all the grads from her grade lol. Well by the time you picked me up and we were out for a while I had forgotten about the things I planned and comfort came on its own each time While that may be true the movies they're watching are also not even good. Today they watched Little Shop of Horrors, so they're actual cult films. And the bad ones!! The unforgivably bad ones To answer your question though it's Reyna, Brian, Bella, Zayna, and Jennifer I probably won't go for half of the days though Lol at Pueblo I felt like the only white person internally although i wasn't a minority on the exterior The huge public school graduations last hourrrrrs because they have ,, fucking students Is cholla a big school? I never realized how much I love and missed hanging around Diviya and my other friends outside of the Zayna group Diviya just called me to complain about not asking anyone for letters of rec so I'm most likely going to ask tomorrow I calculated the rate at which they call graduates and estimated the end time (I did it twice) and got  and . It ended at  I rock 
 grads Ok yeah I may or may not go only on days you do Lol yas Who are you gonna ask Kirk isn't fat   ,   Hey! Go you hahaha. You continue to fascinate me every day ) Tomorrow I am waking up at  to hike with Martha and Diviya and Nate ughhhhh Probably Swindle and the Chinese teacher Yeah, I saw him last night and he looked completely different from what I saw last year Xóchitl and Jenai are two of the most beautiful girls I know oh my god Can I hiked Hik e ? For some reason I really missed Xóchitl so I decided to congratulate her And just message her about life and stuff of course! Martha is coming to pick me up around / And then we're going to saving canyon *sabino 
So after the hike we are going to the school (I have to return books, get yearbook, go to project. Diviya and Martha are going to go around and ask for letters of rec). Are you going to come to the project or will you just go home? They are incredibly beautiful Alright. I'll be there at . Dunno, depends how I feel What did xochi s a y Oh okay well ? Hm? Sorry I was thinking Do you know what happened between Xóchitl and jay I was about to ask jay a while ago but Elizabeth responded sooooo...  Oh ok nvm Anyway good night I just finally got home, so I totally won't be up so early tomorrow (( I'll tell you their story tomorr o w Ok Hi , June  ,   Hey Hi Sunday, June  ,   fuckkkk Emily Davis bartends at oregano's. I'm here right now. Or no she does catering stuff but still My brother just told me he's smokes weed What did you say to that Oregano's is a bad enough memory of its o w n I did the stupidest thing ever but I said I do too And that I can't imagine him doing that and it makes me uncomfortable to think about Yeah I ate too much and I feel sick. A very unenjoyable lunch. Started my résumé though! How was Jay's? My mom has been guilt tripping me hard by saying I need to bond with my brother and giving me half hour long life lessons and then crying and showing me old family photos *by saying I do too What was for lunch? ( I'm actually still here That's gonna bite you in the bu t t Do you remember the months I tutored Sept-October/Nov? Too much pasta and silence. That's what was for lunch. Sorry I have no idea I thought it was summ e r Oh ok I'll talk to you later then Fuck yeah I finished my résumé and my references You should actually start your application online For iHop Alright will  d o Are you ok? Yeah sor r y Ok?? Well open interview tomorrow from -pm Just submit and then call in Ok Hi I couldn't find the applicati o n www.romulusinc.com , June  ,   Anyway then, night Thanks b ) Hey what's up Sorry I was very sporadic with the texts yesterday, I was 🌿 all d a y Yeah I know, Jen told me I'm going to the restaurant around  Are you still at the farm now? I'm sorry that I neglected to text you yesterd a y No I'm on my way home first It's okay Are you nervo u s No, I studied questions that previous iHop workers had for their interviews I also printed my resume and references and put them in a folder Hey sergio Someone just called in and the lady said that they shouldn't come in today Because  people are here, interviews are  min and so if you come in now you probably won't be interview e d Ughhhh You can call if you want to make sure but that's what I understood from my end of the conversation What's  u p Done I see you Comi n g I'm actually going to see the movie at the loft if you want to come Tickets are $!!! Which mov i e Ok cool see you at  with Reyna Wait what movie is it O k Battle beyond the stars, lol ( )  /attachment.PNG Is it good Lol wow on the brid g e Think Troll  good Do you know the history behind the bridge? I've always wondered how people's faces got on it Can you bring a female condom Yes so it was built not long ago They had residents of downtown photographed to be tiled And ok , June  ,   Well goodnight! Have a great first day tomorrow 😉 Goodnight! You too What is Tess's old tumblr handle H e y New bajablastmeintheass Old kenig-is-a-god How did it go Alright Kids were dumb I still had fun Thanks How was your day They could not understand dilutio n s Fine Kids were touchy I pet some horses You're welcome Applied to Bookman's, Buffalo Ex, and Savers Ok I'm jk. I thought it would be fun to text the way you do, you know, without enthusiasm or interest I'm going to go around to different theatre companies this week and ask about auditions and scripts Also I finally tried lychee in its prime and natural form ( )  /attachment.JPG And this is one of the girls I work with. her name is Jazz and she looks like th grade With her duct tape bracelets and half dyed hair (literally each hemisphere is a different color) and track pants  Anyway, I'm glad your day went well. Que tengas un buen however you say evening tardes! How old is she Sorry b I was driving What Live theatre workshop maybe You need some experience or classes... Love lych e e Hi sorry Not like it's even that long lol No idea how old she is Well everyone has to start somewhere and I'm just going to see what happens with it Even if it's just a character with no lines And I just stand there and look hot Like the strings player in Romeo and Juliet (hot hot hot) Aimee I'm feeling really weird about you But I just can't describe ( And it makes me uncomfortable to share stuff like this now Also I've realized that I don't like dancing at parties anymore That makes me sad but nobody ever did it and it was always just me so I lost interest  And you say the type of dancing I did was not the way men are supposed to do it I feel like you don't like hanging out with me or talking to me alone and that you prefer groups. Or that you're super uninterested in me as a person and idk. I don't feel that way at all I'm sorry Why do you feel that wa y ? it's always different with other people around. And recently when I've tried talking to you you seem uninterested. But I did an hour of yoga and I feel a lot better I also finished  Night and I started Taxi Driver How are you? You know the bookman's application had a question that asked how we feel about censorship and I totally rocked it. I used Charlie Hebdo as an example and said that reading material deemed offensive is voluntary. I also had to talk about how I feel connected to either movies or books or games and how I could contribute to the section I work in ( )  /attachment.JPG Fuck I didn't mean to send that Complete accident lol What exactly did you do on the job today? When did you have to work with the kids? I thought keys and Martha's parent's thing were separate? Also I'm just taking your word for how you feel. Honestly I won't be upset if you tell me the truth. I can't believe there used to be porn theaters. Porn watching is NOT something I would feel comfortable sharing with other people. And think about how awkward it would be for both genders to be there at the same time. So they were from SIMI, not keys and I was with them all day long And we just went over some basic chemistry shit and pipetting and PCR Yes I cannot imagine Did they jerk off in the theatres How is taxi driver Sounds like you rocked the application I'm sorry I think it has just been a weird we e k Did you know anyone there? Make any friends? Do you think it's worth going to every day? Well in taxi driver he buys popcorn and a drink and sits with other men and watches. But the movie is great so far. De Niro plays the depressed and directionless well and I love the NY city shots Yeah I think so too! The buffalo exchange application though.... Forget it lol. I like clothing but not to the extent that they expect from me. I know nothing about fabrics or fashion trends in different decades. If I get it then I get it but I'll look like a fool We all have weird weeks but let's try to make the best of this next one, yeah? I care so much for you and I want to have a great time with whatever time we have left Young Robert De Niro, fuccckkkkk , June  ,   The accompanying jazz music is nice too No I didn't know any of them But I liked them overall One girl pissed me off at the end because she spent  minutes asking about where she should park her car going back and forth until Martha's mom got pissed  And I suppose so. I will go every day. Did they ask about that stuff Yeah It sounds like a rad mov i e They didn't ask about it but the website said it's recommended knowledge and that there's in store training during the job. Yeah, anyway... I'll see you later then ? Volunteering tomorrow or no? Yea h p Idk ur taking too long to reply lol I'll probably be asleep next time you reply to me So I'm just saying goodbye Anyway, goodnight Alright I was driving when you sent them and so I missed the notifications but alright Goodnig h t Why so late?? Hung out with jay for like an hour lol Mostly just driving to drop off Logan's forgotten glasses case because jay was drunk and Logan wanted it AS A P Oh ok cool So goodnight What's the plan tonight Are you going to the art thi n g I'd have nothing to submit tonight Oh wait I actually wouldn't need to I think? Anyway I'm going to SAAF at  For Walk in  Right so where you gon be prior to th a t Home I'm going to the art thing the following weeks though. I can't today because it's -pm And then I guess I'll stay to volunteer every wed. after Alright. I'll come pick you up probably around  Hope you have a good time on the farm today   ) Alright! You too ) This guy goes to Brophy (catholic douche school in Scottsdale) and only wears sperries, and rvca and has a vineyard vines sticker on his phone His dad also got him a  Campari Cama r o Lol the school is literally called BRO-phy. Bros and trophies (because they win) I know some kids who go to Salpointe but they go on financial aid He sounds gay He isn't gay lol Hahaha How was your d a y Mmmm have you seen the vineyard vines cases? All the ones on the website are so feminine My day was awesome. I worked in the kitchen all day and got to dance and cook lots of fried rice My hair always looks terrible after I take off my bandana He talked about his gf buddy Why don't you tie it up   O How was your day? Hahah that's what Jennifer does but everyone would think I'm weird Ok a few things I made the mistake of telling the staff that Jen and I are into acting and dancing because they had me go up and improvise some advertisement And I guess now we are in charge of a Tucson village farm ad for the website . Talked to a gay Mormon . I have to tell you about audition stuff He's actually not even a full Mormon. It was passed down from his dad. Was it non-GMO fried rice What do you dance to? And where Tell me all about gay mormon and the audition and AF AD I'll be there at  like I said,
 (b )  /attachment.jpg Wue Wow Come ou t ? I'm out I saw you turn Here Sorry GPA was out didn't know what todo To do , June  ,   Let me know when you're about to go to sleep Also tip never rub your eye after sex!!!!! they need to be teaching that in sex ed  Hi I am about to go to sleep Sorry I got home and I had to do all these things Did it bu r n No no that's okay Jay Ahaha lol maybe we could have sex after our significant others are gone. Elizabeth would be PISSED  If she heard him say th a t Yeah I know lol I'm just not going to reply for a while It burned like hell ( Also my mom collects teabags and random shit for composting but she thinks one can just throw the shit onto plants and it gives the plants nutrients  She doesn't understand that you need to turn it over Yeah there's a method Goodnight! I hope we talk more tomorr o w Goodnight bb!!! I had the best time ever 😘 What's up   b Hi! I just did  minutes of yoga to piano ballads lol What's up with you? How was your day? You probably read all about my day on the FB chat haha Also I know you hate the whole organic craze but goodness's smoothies are great, and if you don't want to go there we should go out and find other smoothie places ( )  /attachment.PNG You know what I'm going to do tonight You know what the fuck I'm gonna do tonight!!!! Apparently OITNB Season  is out now!!!!!! Hi I had a pretty ok day Daniel the lab guy got pissed off twice I still like him though Apparently he is gay And  O he looks  How much do they cost Have you started? Is t go o d Who is Daniel? Mine was $ Yeah it's cool He is one of the doctors PhD Research e r Oh yeah Martha tells me stories about him Like what?!? $ is exorbita n t Why the ?!? Oh just surprise d   Idk, I don't really remember. There was one about how her parents said he's super gay because he shrieked.  I assume he is the gay person she talks about He's really masculine lol Like he looks like a masculine European guy But he is a vegetarian so I guess I should have guess e d Just your type No no it's not like th a t How'd you find out he's gay? I meant that I like learning from h i m Lol that was a joke He's pretty mean but in a constructive way Martha was talking about him at lunch She mentioned his partner And I was like what Apparently the polish city of Lodz is pronounced Wooc h A similar thing happened to me. I was talking to this guy who always mentions his partner, so I assumed he was gay. I asked him what he meant by partner And he said that she's a girl and he feels that girlfriend imposes gender roles and makes it sound like a continuous thing, making it impossible for others to believe that he could have a partner of a different sex *girlfriend But he said that he could be with a guy in the future I still don't understand how Martha's dad's name is pronounced from the phonetics It's like pa-voh but spelled totally differently  Oh I asked and she said he was a guy. But yeah partner is really gender neutral for progressive hoes Polish phonetics. Who knows A continuous thing? I was like he's gay? And she was like didn't you know? Thanks tho I still had no idea how to say his name At least Daniel is simple And Moni c a Yeah. He believes that if you hear someone refer to their SO as girlfriend/boyfriend then you should assume they are solely into that gender.  Which makes no sense to me but whatever He brings up these really profound and interesting topics and then when I answer he just nods, says yeah and stops talking about it as if I didn't even reply Like he brought that up and then I was pushing for a conversation about gender roles and stuff You can call them by their first name? It makes me uncomfortable addressing someone's parent. I never know what to say. OITNB is really good at making me sympathize with people who hate abortions (aka conservatives) But then they made it trashy and turned it into a joke so I don't feel so bad anymore She is baptizing her aborted babies' graves with Mountain Dew They also provided a damn good argument for why abortions are right for some people Everyone else calls them by their first name and so I do too though it made me uncomfortable I need to start watching it... That makes no sense at all How does she try to impose gender roles That's pretty dickish of h i m How does who try to impose gender roles? The partner? Have you still just been watching glee? , June ,  Yeah the partner Yeah but not as much this week, no tim e . Do you have homework? ?? I don't understand. I'm just saying that they don't use the term boy/girlfriend because it imposes gender roles. How is monosexuality a gender role Oh I misread I read it as He feels like his girlfriend imposes gender roles I skipped over your added quotations edit No homework 
Well yesterday we were supposed to read up on something but I was just walking into the room as he said it so I didn't really think he meant it to me and I didn't do it, but they didn't either and I learned it within  minutes when he brought it  u p Lol diviya and I just facetime'd but I forgot that I tied my hair up and it was so embarrassing I had to end it She said wtf after Anyway I understand the gender roles argument but I think that the permanent sexuality thing is a stretch  I mean don't you think it's silly that you do it just out of habit even when your hair is so short that I couldn't possibly affect acne? Whatever you want tho How did you respond Maybe she said wtf because you hung  u p Everytime by Britney is so underrated Today I did it for yoga then I undid it. I only did it again because it puts me in the zone and gets me focused. I pull it like one tightens a ponytail. Which I needed for ACT studying I told him I use boyfriend but that I'm willing to accommodate to whatever my partner says Eh, she was working anyway. God I feel like such a fag I don't understand your relationship decisions Can you call me big papa Or daddy Whichever you prefer I'll check the song o u t I actually referred to you as Papa A on Instagram Ok well goodnight Good nigh t ! thought u were dead Jerkin the gherk i n K cool H e y Hi how are you? Great I learned so much today I got home and wrote it all down I feel very accomplished And happy And I'm going to ask more questions tomorrow and write it all down And then scan it And then save it to google drive And one day I will have an encyclopedia of biology in my own words  I'll be unstoppable They are just so damn good at explaining things Wb u ?
That's great! I feel accomplished as well. Today during the parent's potluck the leader called me up and said I was being promoted to an official counselor and said a couple of nice words. Also farm yoga was a succes . I also picked some produce and made a little produce gift bag for you I want to make you a squash boat Aren't you sad to not be working with the SIMI kids anymore? Still working with them Is Reyna hanging out with Alex soon? Do I remember correctly What does the promotion mean for you Were you the one that mentioned squash boats to me earlier? Like today it was me and just one of the SIMI ki d s Yes to Reyna, and she actually asked me today if I wanted to come. Yes to squash boats too Sorry. I'm not actually sure what the promotion consists of, but I think I can get paid. Wow that's exciting What did you do after farm today Have you hung out with anthony y e(t )  /attachment.jpg I've almost accidentally sent stuff to your mom lol I got invited to some get together on Sunday with people from Diviya's Arab thing  
After farm I hung out with Jennifer for a while. We both got hired to babysit the children for one of the staff members, which is super exciting because they live in these little communities and one of our friends lives there Then we picked and bagged some produce to take home.  And I once I got home I took a nap Now I'm not really doing much. Just ate. Wbu? What's up No because I never respond to his messages lol, which is terrible. What are those shoelaces ugh A joke That's what they are Aw thanks b The staff member would have been babysitting them? I was taking notes, then I worked on coding a bit. Now I am about to watch glee. What did you e a t
It's kinda sad because at first I wanted the laces but then I came to despise them because of my lack of money. The ugh signifies discomfort in a state of poverty. You would have been able to tell if you had received a  on AP lit. Oh I meant that the staff member has a child (who also volunteers) and Jen and I are friends with the child So we are going to babysit the child. I'll document what it is like inside of a hippie commune home There are four houses that connect to each other and apparently all four families eat dinner together every night I've been eating a bowl of salad and drinking tea every night. About  cups a day! at the farm there was Jamaica prickly pear tea and then cucumber ginger lemon water I really miss it ( Also homemade horchata and lassi (absolutely terrible please never try it unless you are into abuse and torture... I mean I know you are but not this kind) The owners of twisted tandoor came and made it for us Yeah you're welcome, hottie So maybe two nights ago I started watching Annie Hall and I find Woody Allen so fucking annoying ( )  /attachment.JPG Look at the menu. We NEED to go there. It's our priority place now, unless you suggest otherwise. My ass has taken such a pounding the past few weeks. I feel like I am basically on a colon cleanse. Poverty Were the drinks good I am making Tunisian fish soup  I have made horchata, it rocked  Also it caused diabetes Why was the lassi so bad What have you eaten that led to that problem I know a lot about colon s   The spices used for the drink didn't complement it and it is literally Greek yogurt mixed with water. Every other drink was sooo good though. This guy who works at Trader Joes knew all the recipes. I will probably make that this week. I have been looking for something good to eat using fish. What's in it? Today Jen and I made cheese that tasted like nothing because nobody added any salt!!!! Lol drinking and all, diabetes from horchata is the least of my concerns But I've been drinking cleansing and diet teas sooooo I know a lot about colons Bitch you've been working in a lab for less than a week I researched today I love trader joes I'm gonna be one of those people who only shops there Nothing really interesting http//www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/tunisian-aromatic-fish-soup-with-potatoes- I had always wanted to make chee s e Yess I also decided that I will shop there as well. Even farmer's markets or Market on the Move. I also want my own garden and chickens.  Oh yeah I found that link already That's the recipe I'm going to use I want to live a very local lifestyle where I'm involved in the community and shit like that.  I want to have a party where I ask people to bring ingredients and I'll set up different stations and people can make cheese or wine in one area and work on drinks in another  People can come over and maybe harvest some fruits and vegetables and get the chicken eggs  I also want time to work on my art and I want a little studio where I can hire people to pose for me When everyone is at my house they'll say wow, you must've paid thousands for this and I'll say haha nah bitch I did it myself Jay's yoga room is so cool too. I want one of those so I can have my daily yoga sex sessions. Describe to me your dream life/home I'm getting too into this right now 
The stay at home lifestyle is pretty appealing too. I would wake up and start with a copy of the New Yorker and yoga or maybe a  mile run or sabino canyon. decide what I want to make for dinner from my various ethnic cookbooks. breakfast made and heated in the oven so my husband can eat while I'm out. I would also love getting high some nights and just relaxing by my pool in the nude , June ,  That would be a fun party Do you think this is like your church camp phase Where you will tone it down a lot in a couple weeks or no My dream life hmm Epidemiologist for CDC, work  months of the year in cool places Spend the rest of the year chillin with my homies Mansion in nature, super modern, walls of windows Oregon or some shit Forest Gardens  Lake Or river  Music room  With tons of jazz LPs Portland food Canoeing at dawn You know Your dream lifestyle is a lot more achievable And that's great You could do all that on a middle class income ... Not so much. Would need to make like K minimum The house would be made of wood I think I'm done with 🌿. For real Don't like it that much And I don't want to have the thought in the back of my mind that it is hurting my brain No more I love being sober  I love learning  I love life Why harm the time I spend sober By using 🌿 I'll stick to 🍸in the future. It has bad effects but not on brain as much  Not that I'm sure 🌿 is bad, very limited studies, but don't want to ri s k I've always thought of the Ex Machina house as my dream house but I've come to realize that I enjoy the simple life a lot more and that I want to be in a vibrant city, not secluded. Maybe secluded for my vacations. Ex Machina house for the fall or winter  Actually me too. At least the exterior. I can't believe I didn't think of that comparis o n I feel the same way about doing things in front of people. I've never smoked since prom night and I'm not going to. I'll try shrooms and that's it. I think in the future I'll stick to wine Ex Machina house minus glass windows and drab futuristic interior  I'm looking forward to having so much time to read. I want a library Actually I knew you would say that this might be a phase, but it is what I have wanted for a long time now and I think that if it makes me happy now then it could make me happy later. As long as I have friends and security then I'm okay My dream is comfort And happiness 😊😊😊 ( )  /attachment.PNG I think I'm a relatively happy person based on my emoji selections. The knife was from last night when we were pretending to be depressed. I want to watercolor We could do a watercolor da t e !!!!!!!!!!! You have no idea how happy I am to hear you say that I love you ) We can sit in a park or on some hill and paint the city Or the mountains Or each other O Sunset and mountains? I have limited skill. A portrait would be like a blob But yeah that sounds gre a t I think I have a bunch of brushes, but if I don't then I'll get some this week I've got the supplies covered, don't worry We can also have a picnic while we're there Lol well what you can do is light sketching prior to using the paint  And then it's basically painting in the lines. The problem is making sure the paint doesn't flow and maintaining/creating color You'll teach me Because I'm very shit at a r t Omg I remember when Shawn and I broke up I painted this piece very clearly about him, referencing his ethnicity and our dates. It was basically a timeline progression of our relationship in a painting. It appeared in the art show and he went by every piece except mine The title was X-Mas Presents Japanese Summer Fruit lol It was monochromatic (red) and followed the golden spiral precisely I recall It Do you have it stil l   How do you know about it???? Did I ever show you?? Yeah I'm gonna look for it You know You should wear the mid thigh shorts and sperries You got dem legs And y e s I found it... It is atrocious. There's a line that says Obsession and stories of heartbreak I remember I thought It was kinda shitty looking but I kept that to myself Where had you kept  i t I only got good at art once I started doing better in school It was odd. Like every class skill set improved It was in some box I still haven't unpacked from the move lol That's really nice of you to say I also like rolling up pants to the mid calf I would wear those shorts but I don't know what shirt to wear with them ACT tomorrow! Don't matter people will be blinded by leg Good luck Go to sleep O M G Lol I physically can not go to sleep earlier than  Especially since I napped today I was up kinda late on SAT night Omg don't even get me started on APs. Like  am APUSH night. Time management is the only problem but I got a nearly perfect score on my practice exam When working on my own time The only thing that worries me anymore is the essay writing Well I me a n I feel like because I'm not in school anymore my writing is shitty The ACT is literally all about time Everyone knows that I feel the same way I feel like sometimes I want a word and I don't know the word. Happens to me every summer .   Did you see the article about Joseph 
“Joseph is an exemplary student and he excels in all curricular subjects at BASIS Tucson North,” notes BASIS Tucson North Director of Student Affairs Michelle Wohlford. “It is not surprising that he achieved a perfect score on the ACT given his track record at our school. We expect great things from him in the future.” Where was Diviya's  recognition It's because he's white. We all know it. Really though, I am proud of Joseph's achievements but my problem is that I think that a perfect ACT score shows nothing of his character And that's what I'm more concerned with and what I think the world should focus more on Rather than admissions and test scores that could be based off an intrinsic knowledge Rather than admissions and test scores that could be based off an intrinsic knowledge what Does this mean What is an intrinsic knowled g e Like you It's exactly you You don't even fucking study for these exams You are literally the epitome of intrinsic knowledge Let me let you in on something I realized today I don't have intrinsic knowledge I'm just really curious And I look a lot of shit up About like everything that's how I know things Now that's the knowledge bit. The test-taking ability I can't explain through my actio n s No no no, I mean for the logic tests Yes, exactly Neither can I But my theory at the mome n t But I'm sure somebody can Is that I studied less and less through middle school Became more and more dependent on deductive reasoning and test-taking ability Honed that school through high school by not studying  And b a m Perhaps. I definitely think that doing well on these exams is something that can be improved and that whether or not you did well in middle school there's a way around the system.  Your theory would explain deducing meanings of words through prefixes and most of the math I'm fast Good at skimming for answers I know the greek and Latin for the prefix e s So that's probably where the reading comes in #BasisAdvantage I never took a Latin class in my life I learned the prefixes this year Who knew bell- meant war It always sounded so pretty to me That's because SPANISH Not meant to be ca p s So I think I'm actually going to sleep soon Idk what time I need to be at the test center lol I remember I knew what odious and amicable meant using Spanish  GREGARUOUS *gregarious Alright, good night .   Mmmmmhm Mmmmmhm 🐢 gd  ngt (not nigat) 💖🐸💁  the emojis that remind me of you plus turtle 🍆🌿😘🌚 you Look up Ela Barton- Arizona. What a bitch. So unnecessary and untrue. Slam poetry could be cool if it wasn't so social justice bitchy % of the t i Fmuce k I can't sleep I just jerked of Off Also wow I can't believe 🌿 I rarely ever talk about it http//gratuitouspublicnudity.tumblr.com/post//thatprettymafucka-the-end-of-the-video-is-the Sip Sup* How did it   Dgo o you find that attractive I tried listening to Ela Barton (who is apparently a he) last night but I couldn't concentrate, so I'll try again soon. According to her website she is a s h Tehe?
 ACT was okay. I knew everything would be fine except for the writing and that is exactly what happened. Where did you see that? How did writing   Dgo o you think it's acceptable for me to flirt with other people? I find it modestly attractive, but I thought you would like it lol No not intentiona l Ilt y was in the bio of the YouTube video I watched Well I mean my points were clear but I didn't flesh them out. The example essay in the prep book was . pages long and mine was .... The prompt was whether or not a universal healthy food rating system should be implemented I would have found it more attractive if my mom wasn't next to me when I opened it Ok that's what I think too but Diviya says flirting is something she can't help And she's told Nate that lol What have you done today? Brook in OITNB is so hot Did she see it Sorry You know I never took ACT with writing You know Diviya is like me to the extreme but it is socially acceptable because she is female and her partner is male I watched the first episode of OITNB some coding  Some glee  I like brook's hair Wbu? What does your day look l i Skome eone told me that unless you take the ACT with writing then it doesn't matter to colleges  Depends on the college  b Iu tt hink we can all say we are basically the same person as Diviya but for this instance I don't agree at all Most require that if send in only the ACT it has to be with writing  But I sent in both and Ms. Fulford said they would consider my ACT I mean with regards to relationship brashness Like she does a lot of insensitive things to Nate that we overlook, and that y'all would kill me for if I did to that exte n Att . least she is still very loving( )/ at  tachment.png #strictlybusiness Well it's expected from her with her social justice stances  https//www.groupon.com/deals/new-delhi-palace- this? That's not a decent reason lol but ok You gonna go to nd sat? I'm making cottage cheese Did you know my family keeps bread in the free z Tehar t looks awesome. Do you want me to give you money to pay or vice versa? Also the place I talked about yesterday is a food truck called twisted tandoor I am but I think Martha and I are eating before or something I basically made cottage cheese minus the cream Cottage cheese and peaches or blueberries is the best My mom does that too lol She puts anything in the freezer and then takes it out months later and says it's not spoiled( )/ at  tachment.JPG Too much, too much I feel like it's only okay to say the first part in person  Diviya sends me way too much She has basically turned into how I used to be How is your cottage cheese turning out? Pic? It is fucking awesome( )/ at  tachment.jpeg Done Where does the food truck go Idk about the groupon. Will get back to you Yeah that's a bit too intimate to share In pic form Yes peaches!  I usually don't eat it sweet tho Just on to(a )s/ t at  tachment.PNG That looks so good. You're just eating it plain? The food truck goes all over Tucson. Every day they post their location and menu on their Facebook page. Omg look up ruby rose Lol Diviya so dumb for being so smart No I had it on toast And it was awesome Like x better than regular cottage cheese Also probably like double the fat But oh so worth   Yieat h I've known about ruby for almost a year now after that short film. So sexy. So sexy  Brook looks like ... Oitnb is filmed in an abandoned kids psychiatric war d H eyO
 sorry It was funny because this guy I know who works at trader joes said that people go in there all the time and assume everything is healthy because it's from trader joes but they know nothing about portions I had a childhood friend whose house used to be a retirement home. There were ramps inside for wheelchairs and stuff The prison interior always seemed pretty small to me Brook looks... hot Her naïveté is sexy If your dick could talk what would it be say i nOng ly if you've been tested What does that mean Oh wait Never mind I get it What   Wuelp l just went to spark root, eating at food for ascension, and then party later Or like some drinking get together Can I come? This is l a Mmm e well Diviya and I are going to some Arab friends house 
 Oh right Sorry I though it was an us people th i Wnelg l Reyna is coming too But they ate with us Jay got Elizabeth high so they can't come You can come if you want I guess Oh ok Wh e Ork e well Sunday, June   ?, M  e W ha? t's wrong My phone keeps dying Over and over And then coming back on What's the plan Where you at B I need you  I want  y Doivu iya and I are with some kids now.

 east th street apt  Shit I would have met you But the notification came in when I was on the phone w police Oh well I'll be the r Cean 
 you take Diviya and me home?  W hayn be  Ok What's   Uu rp
 beautiful U r too ??????* ???🌺 Goodnight beebzzy  Goodnight bis b Ien e my dream Hector took a snapchat video of Larissa working out naked and she had a man chest  https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=QPQBlFzNZE&feature=youtu.be Bisbee Pride June -! I actually reaally want to go Fuck yeah! I'm scheduled for a phone interview with bookmans. Omfg I can just imagine Larissa with man boobs and chest hair and puffy nipples It's strange to me because I can turn it on or off and I know when I am doing a gay or straight voice How about we go the th? Congrats! ! S!he!
 had puffy nipples that didn't fit the size of her pec. It was all so weird. Hector was in the vent lol. I knew you could tell when you're doing it!!! You liar Unfortunately I can not switch and I have tried, trust me Also though it doesn't matter to me Why does it matter to you so much? I think that if people can't like you for the way you normally talk then fuck them. I'm not going to change my voice to feel more accepted. Well I could do it in the first place as switching from girl to guy voice, basically natural vs forced vo i Yceae h!!! That'll be awesome. Maybe we can invite some other gays or something And I just maintained that ability. It's nice I guess but I wouldn't care so much if I sounded gay all the time Or Diviya lol Well sometimes I just switch and don't notice  If I think about it I would know But I usually don't It just happens depending on cont e Oxkat y but what's so different about talking in gay voice around me and girl friends vs. being around the guys? It's also not just the voice change but also filler words like dude and man What do you feel more comfortable with Codeswitch(i )n/ g at  tachment.jpeg Omg all the Jew references in  to . Especially that baseball one hahahah. Look it up How far are you into the sea s Hoahn aha Jay's snap jay *snapchat I meant  to  the movie, but I'm halfway through episode . It's funny how people say they hate flirting/cheating while in relationships and then do it anyway No I know you meant - 
 to  * Who are you referring   Sturo e, but why do you feel the need to express yourself differently according to the gender you are conversing with  A universal conversation is sex Even without having done it there is plenty to talk about I'm referring to many things in general. We see it in movies and tv shows and even in real life. Basically piper is like ya Alex we dating now, if anyone flirt with you I'm gonna pop a bitch and then Ruby Rose comes along I feel like you think I've actually cheated on you Do not ruin shit for me Ho Dunno it's subconscious. Maybe it lets me connect better Nah, though I don't think you prevent people from coming onto you promptly and strongly as I would have liked pretty of t Yeoun
 literally ruined shit for me yesterday by telling me to look up ruby (originally only knew the face). Then I saw all these ruby has the hots for piper in OITNB posts, bitch. Well I think I can connect to people regardless, especially with sensitive guys like Jay. I don't let my voice hinder any relationships  You and Caleb both send me shit about this ruby bi t Ecxch ept ours ( You sent it first... Ok I just think it changes things and you don't realize it Like you get the sensitive side of jay And I do n A'ndt
 I also don't get the sensitive side of jay because we talk about other things like privilege and race relations and other issues  It's both sides and that satisfies me And I'm ok to happy with that That's great that you get what you want but how I am gets me what I want I like how my relationships are with the straight boys The hate sex was really nice on OITNB You know I normally hate watching woman on woman. It's disgusting to me. But piper and Alex are the except i Hoeyn
 what's up I actually wish I had more alone time with some of the straight boys I'm friends with, like Nate and Jay I used to watch lesbian makeouts on YouTube because I thought it would make me straight But like the Japanese school girls shit Alex takes charge like nobody else Did it work Jk When did you want to be straight I am in the b a Oth h cool Well the pastor meetings made me wish I was because I felt like being gay was just something that would make people dislike me I always knew I liked guys and from th-th grade I wanted people to think I was straight I also tried convincing myself that I was I thought that I would never have a relationship with a guy because I had never met a person who openly came out to me as gay I felt like being straight was the only way to find love or any partnership until Anthony came along When the opportunity came up I ditched Maria  That's really sad Did you watch those it gets better videos in that period? If so what did you think of them Also, I just realized why texts are brilliant Like yesterday, how that guy rambled, that wouldn't happen over text 
You make a point, I respond and elaborate, then you do the same. Texting means that you are expected to respond before I begin speaking again. Also, it is supposed to stay relatively brief so you don't ramble and bore the other per s Io sn
tarted watching those videos in th and th grade and i promised myself that one day I would move to NYC or SF where the gays hang out so I could find a partner. They were a source of hope for me. Now I understand the deeper message but I wasn't aware of child abuse, etc. It pisses me off having conversations with people who ramble because I eventually lose the point of the conversation and I'm not sure which part of what he's saying is relevant With texts I can read and reread messages and ponder your message and then formulate my response My only problem with texting is full articulation and the lack of emotion  Also the instantaneous storytelling instead of making it more dramatic or humorous in person I have no idea how I was able to speak clearly last night  It was more clear than when I am sober I guess it was because I didn't feel timid around you drunk I can't fathom how you still feel timid around me Lol I remember the NYC obsess i Iot'n s not really timid but that I don't want to tell you things that could hurt you And when I do I feel terrible What's ur plan Like what's up Dunno Debating going to saskia's things It's not a party party And it is with the same people as yesterday W Tbhau t sounds eh hahah I'm leading people in yoga at this Arab picnic lol Oh how long does that   Egndo s at ! Maybe you can pick us up and we can swim at Diviya's or something YASSSS I'm gonna make soup I'll bring you s o Huahp ah well we can eat it at Diviya's  
 E River Rd Tucson, AZ, United States Donde Ezra's Estas  What's up Ok  Should I come (n )o/ w at  tachment.jpeg We thought you were on your way!!! Look it's my friend Sara!( )/ at  tachment.JPG Oh! Ok I'm on my way now t(h )e/ n at  tachment.jpeg And Diviya  Y'all are beautim(o )u/ s at  tachment.jpeg And Sergio's v-neck That too , June   W,ha  t ever happened to your soup! You know, another example of being sexy was kissing the box but that was ultimately a failure I thought that by telling people I was imagining it was you then you'd be turned on Serious about the soup though bae  Maybe we can invite Reyna to pride That would be super fun I didn't finish it before I went to pick you up I thought it would be at  Hahahahha hahahahahahahs That's so funny Omg Sweet goal, but drunk log i Acim  ee I'm kinda drunk right now but like you actually make me happy And I feel like you where I can't express the amount Of happiness I feel for you Not only am I glad we're committed but like your presence and conversations  and your being just excites me I
 d) on't really want a response unless you feel like it hah because I know u But I reaaaaaaaally want you to know That's what I was just think i Bnecg ause I never want to hurt you intentionally Just feel loved 😘 Don't speak But il Lysol to Reyna *ill talk to Reyna And maybe we can all pitch in gas money Alright  😍 Let's talk tomorrow Gotta get dat sl e aewep some!!! Hahahah Gotta get get get dat sleep sleep sleep Goodnig h Gtoo! dnight my prince  Kind of want to see Jurassic world . I. s. aw sweeneys post and now I feel like I should too Also sorry, I accidentally left my phone at home and I just got back According to NPR Sunday is national yoga day Also omg the NAACP Spokane president Consider white people who grow up in a predominantly black community; are they black? Let's talk about that next time we see each other I'm actually seeing Jurassic today  Fuck my cousins are sooooo hot And they drive camaros  Hi What's up Which cousins I don't think that's much of a discussion. Jennifer isn't white. But   Jousk t got home. Wbu The ones I sent the pic of, only now they're older  Ok well NPR made it a discussion, gosh The thing is that why does a drop of ethnic blood suddenly make you distinguishable as completely ethnic Does not personal identity play a role in your race I don't know where to draw the line but Consider white people who grow up in a predominantly black community; are they black? Is a clear and absolute no to me  I just got home too What did you do all day Today my PCR was the only one that worked so I'm proud of t h May t brother called the police because he didn't want to go to scouts and so both grandpa and mom called the police that he wouldn't listen What about internal race where jay doesn't feel Indian and I don't feelxican inside Went out for breakfast this morning, hung out with my cousins and watched unbreakable kimmy schmidt, and then went out to see Jurassic World I had to come home and deal with this bullshit Call me stupid but I don't know what PCR is. You all mention it nonstop but never explain it to me. Did the police come You know To me race means skin color and ancestry To me it doesn't matter if Jay doesn't feel Indian. Because all Indian means to me is that he has genetic indian origin.  To be fair someone could say To me it doesn't matter if Aimee doesn't feel female. Because all female means to me is that she is genetically female But I really think more goes along with being female than does with being of some eve Race Anyone of any race can be anything, it means nothing other than ancestry. Female means having some bodily characteristics of which I am not a fan of and do not desire and have changed.  I'm sorry b ( Is it normal for you to hang with your cousins PCR = polymerase chain reaction. Basically artificial DNA replication  Are you b u Usmmy m is  or  or  okay? Which works for your Reyna and I are going out for coffee. She's picking me up from scouts I think Can I come or  n Lool?
 yes I'm asking you what time works for you Oh , W ou? ld you be able to pick me up at  From scouts Ya ok S u Mraye be  extra minutes, thanks a bunch boo Come out boo , June ,  Y'all laughin up a st o rI m compared Osama Bin Laden to Ronald Reagan in their indifference to the destruction each of them brought to the city I lived in. - Jay Z, Decoded  Also I'm sorry. I was really inconsiderate of your presence and I wish you had told me sooner. I don't want you to feel like that and I'm going to be more aware next time. You could've said bye or something Hmph  Sorry I thought I said bye. It's ok Eh Ronald Reagan is less responsible than Ed K o Aclsh o I'm sorry. I was really inconsiderate of your presence and I wish you had told me sooner. I don't want you to feel like that and I'm going to be more aware 
 next time. I love how the literary references made in Fun House are explained  *home( )/ at  tachment.jpeg Reyna and I agree you are such a nerd What could one intelligent person possibly discuss with an unintelligent person in their relationship?! How am I a nerd How far are you into the book What are you doing today Is Keizer getting grey ha i Hrow 
 are we supposed to know who Ed Koch is haha I'm on page  or something. Early s. It's actually super cute So Reyna and I went to bookmans and picked out books and had a reading date. Then we went to cartel and continued reading and we have been talking for hours  We also took a trip to lucky wishbone (my first time!!!) to get some chicken strips and bread and fries hahah. KZ is actually super self conscious about that ( but it certainly does look like he is lol Sounds like you had a great day! Did you like lucky wishbone Poor guy It's dense for a graphic no v Ie dl id have a great day. Nearly spent the whole day together until I left at .  How was your day? How are you feeling? Suuuuper dense. Sure she defines some of the concepts but there various references I don't understand or find confusing to interpret  Nevertheless, I only have  pages left and I think it's an explicitly precise representation of gender and sexuality identity. What is your opinion on the book? Some of the dad graphics and stories turn me on. What's up Bass lesson one  s Oeh c no. I just thought you were still upset with me. I really loved it And I liked the drawings of the photos of the younger guy he was with, with curly hair My day was great I love my mentor She is so great  Reyna left her phone h e Ir ke now. Her mom called me so I texted her and asked what she wants to do about it. Any plans ma d Ie t? ell you when she's on her way and then you just go out and give it to her. It's strange to me that I get from you what I want Say you or I didn't respond or give a terse response then I can expect the same back Or like basically we can choose to continue a conversation or just not address certain things Ok anyway Curly haired Roy was cute I am confused as to what you m e Navmn Diviya and I are planning out a bday camping party the th Of course Diviya wants the Jeffrey's Good god I hope she is joking Here is her list Sergio, Diviya, Nate, Martha, Aimee, Reyna, Madeleine, Jen, Elliot, Hannah, Jeffrey's, Trenton, Shayda, Josh, Nina, Ivan No Joseph? Or J a Byot? h out of town Right Where is jay going again? And Jeffrey's is incorrect grammar, that's a possessive. How did she get an ? J k S ha) wn, Demi, and Ale too What I feel like this is a wormhole to last year's fight. Or your are joking  I think you are jok(i )n/ g at  tachment.PNG Jay is going to Atlanta Honestly I want Shawn to go ? ?? !? ! W!el! l if Demi and I could make amends then why can't him and I Man you and Reza Have the incessant desire to make amends He has already graduated high school, moved on. You should too. No need to rekindle a dead fire with a shitty guy Especially why invite him to a thing like this All your close friends and Shawn? Reyna doesn't like him, I don't like him. Ask him to lunch or something. Sorry that was pretty m e Eah,n
 you're probably right I guess. Used to that by now Jk. That was bitchy but not really. Honestly I was just channelling my deep desire to not camp with all our friends + Sha w Rney  na and I both agreed it was bitchy for you to say I love you Reyna and then not even say bye to me Sorry it was super unintentio n Bautl
 then we ended up having this half hour conversation about you I think I said bye to you both but I meant it to you What conclusions did you re a Acndh
 your whole thing about I love you and how it's easier to say it to friends and stuff You don't say it to me even in a friendly way because you don't want me to assume you mean it more than the way it was intended But it's easier for you to say it to her And at this point I don't really care I feel like if you were going to say anything at all then you would've said it earlier  Oh haha we also talked about your nerdiness and how your walls make it difficult to connect. We think your ideal partner will be one who isn't very emotional or romantic  But competitive like you If I was with someone else as competitive as I am we would kill each other I don't think I have walls, btw. I think I just don't proffer personal things without prompting I have definitely had friends I was super open with about absolutely everything (Al e Oxk ) but he's an asshole and I feel like he is the wrong person to open up to He wasn't an asshole to me, for a long time He respected   Tmhee n what's so different about your friends now? He's an asshole cos he thinks he is better than everyone Du n Dno o you think I respect you? I'm just in a less vulnerable and emotional part of my life But the truce is fragile and I would rather not disrupt it Yes. Well, m Mostly  I think you tell yourself you will always respect me and that's easy to do when I'm unemotional and not in conflict with any of your own interests But I think you try very hard to make me happy I don't have a problem with your minor indiscretions at all It happens Last night, the Zayna BS, no big de a Slo . then if those are minor indiscretions what are things I do that show a lack of respect? Repetition thereof  A là the Sara incident Or how last night was close to a repeat of the night at Diviya's when I was asleep You say you feel shitty about doing it to me but it repeats But it isn't a big d e Laasl t night you told me to put on a condom and you let me have sex with you and then you told me it was awesome..... And I don't think you do it out of disresp e Lcikt e last night you didn't tell me not to Not the sex In the morning, arou n Id t  ried doing it in the morning? Yeah Rubbing your boner on   Omk e I actually wasn't trying to go in this morning but ok No I know But you woke me up at least twice I think And I love when you do what you did  But not right then and I thought I made that clear That I needed my sl e Ie mp ean I know that I went in when it was okay (?) but I moved myself from the bed because I was upset with myself for constantly bothering you And that is kinda why I ignored you this morning I was so upset because I thought you were annoyed with me Also what did you do with the cond o Tmoi? let Gr I'm sorry you became so upset with yourself And I was a bit annoyed but I was completely over it by the morning But I knew that's why you ignored me But I wasn't sure if you were perhaps mad at  m Iet'? s so strange to me because I am a heavy sleeper and you could probably do the same to me and I wouldn't wake up Like jerk me off in my sleep Or sit on my erect dick Cum. Come. Sorry. Sorry for making it sexual. Ooooooooo o Whel! l I got mad after you left but Reyna has me talk things out and feel better I need to take charge of my sexuality I'm serious about that I was considering making a poster or something so that I can remember that daily Well it's sad for me to see your needs go unanswered.  And I don't want you to be unsatisfied secually  Secually Sexually And so I think it is acceptable for you to sometimes push things But not like this morning.  And not like when you got drunk and kept telling me you needed to tell me a secret  l Noo l but the point of taking control of myself is that I won't push you anymore. It isn't a need, it's more that every time I'm in the mood I feel like I can just do what I want. Which is not okay It is pointless to share my beliefs on sex (like doing it when you drop me off, etc.) if I won't take charge and show it's what I actually believe  I want to be more passive about sexual encounters and stop being so hyperactive. I need to feel wanted and discover sex from the other side too. I need to stop sharing sex with people who aren't part of it because it is my sex and my body and your body. And I need to respect my body And most importantly, yours. I am sorry ( What makes me feel sexually dissatisfied is myself You know, that's a lot more introspective than I have ever been about sex So I commend you Even if you don't follow through in the near future, good on you for understanding what is up And I agree with you that my ability to express desire for you is a bit smothered by your hyperactivit y Whe  n people are telling me that i am the most sexual person they know and that I have a distinct passion for sex how can I not be introspective about this??? It's bothers me for so long  *bothersd I want your help with this though I at least want to follow through with it until you leave With casual stuff I won't really care because it won't be as continuous. The discussing part is something I want to stand by Yeah I need to slow it down , June ,  Have you read this week's Amherst controver s Oyh ? yes totally! A hell of a controversy. No, please explain. It's somewhat expected but ironic to me given how much they touted their emphasis on preventing and punishing  sexual harassment  It's because a couple years ago they were in the news for the opposite, not taking these things seriously enough Many admitted  kids and parents when I was there expressed concerns regarding sexual harassment at amherst In fact my friend at ATC wrote her big play about how their administration ignored reports of sexual assault Discussing what? Oh wait nvm I mean of course you would be introspective but it is great that you have quickly come to such sincere conclusions How can I help you Ok so I'll send you an article about it It's such a mess All over the news and Internet http//reason.com/blog////amherst-student-was-expelled-for-rape - Wbhau t the fuck How does she withdraw consent? It just seems so clear to me who is guilty here And if this is such a huge scandal then why doesn't the school do anything about it Especially since media outlets are covering it and there is evidence  What fuck ups They don't know what to do They want to be tough on people who harass  I mean they may let this guy back in but They need to figure out a policy shift That respect the interests of both the victim and the defendant I know right Still love em  t Rheso pect the interests of both the victim and the defendant Omgggggg I
 r? eally think in cases of sexual assault the defendant's 'interests' shouldn't matter too much But then things like this happen You can't presume guilt. You can't bypass a fair trial of the evidence 
And sometimes, the fact is, there is a lack of evidence, and that MUST mean a not guilty verdict. That is how we stop innocent people from being punished, which is to me a greater injustice than not punishing the guilty. I'm reading this paper about microbes that live on and in animals and it is crazy You can take a genetically obese mouse (mouse has a genetic hormone imbalance which leads it to always be hungry), and take its poop and put its microbes in a normal mouse and the normal mouse will get obese.

 sorry I fell asleep early I didn't think you could text while you are working so I didn't respond, idk Also you are the king of not addressing things I said the night before I think Miley is doing a great thing though. Her Instagram posts show her millions of fans that these trends or phases are not that, but real things that real people experience I've come around to genderfluidity The key to making our enemies obese Maybe that is what the Chinese andxicans know that we don't But we do now You've always wondered what ghetto people talk about; here is a girl from the job program I didn't do( )/ at  tachment.PNG Oh I am on lunch Sorry I like Miley's efforts too How do you feel about gender fluidity  Lol @ the obesity but mexico is as obese as us Maybe to try to disguise their intentions What a wonderful conversati o In'm 
 meeting Arabic program kids for lunch soon I no longer define gender as two strict gender identities and I totally support the use and announcement of different pronouns. It all makes sense to me and it is this feeling. She started this beautiful movement called InstaPride and tells the stories of different LGBTQ folk every day, as well as raising awareness about LGBTQ homelessness. That was the most awkward lunch I have ever been to. How did it go Do you relate to it? Yeah I heard about instapr i NdO e I AM NOT I LIKE 🍆 Well it was me, an American University girl who talked to me about her LGBTQA club (...), a quiet Air Force girl, the guy Diviya cheated with, tufts kid, and Sara Oh and Diviya In a way I do relate to it because I've always hated having to live up to male expectations and just being a male in general  There are so many circumstances where I feel like a female and it's not consistent It has always just felt like I have to either be a female or a male but gender is so much more than that. Do you still want to get a gift for your dad? I think I am going to get him something tractor related He likes tractors And the cavaliers Maybe a tractor with cavalier colors and logo 🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆 Did she flirt with him Is she a gay The american university bish Gender Expectations and gender roles != gender identity Like at least from my standpoint there isn't a comparison to be drawn between those conce p Jtohs n Deere has great tractors. You can buy one and just paint on the Cavalier colors and logo. Lots of flirty eye contact and on the way back to the UA he was looking for a girl to sit on his lap and Diviya didn't know what to do No, she is an ally. I was telling her my church camp story and she interrupted the moment I said church camp and said I'm an atheist  Explain gender expectations? That's just a bit out of my price range. Unless you mean they have great toy ones. What do you mean he was looking for a girl to sit on his lap Is he hot That's not very nice of her, hm p Rhea. l tractors can't be that expensive, c'mon. Father's Day  only happens once in his lifetime. There wasn't enough space in the car so they had to sit each other's laps, but I walked away before I saw who was sitting with who He is hot but still no excuse( )/ at  tachment.PNG We laugh and make fun of those people who have stupid conversations but it's nice in a way because the conversations are lighthearted  https//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Stevens_(cyclist)# Fuck. 's and Africa just sounds like the biggest adventure ever. Yes it's endearing and reminds you that shit ain't so serious You're right. I asked him what he would do with a tractor and he said dig up stuff, and trees. And then cover things. Lol. Are you gonna get gpa someth i In ag dore adventure/travel stories like Jules Verne, and even more so when they are real. How did he cross the ocean? Yes, Aimee. Shit ain't so serious. Hahaha he can finally do some radical stuff with that plot you guys have next to the backyard  And look very dashing while doing so with his colorful tractor   Gender expectations basically mean gender roles b t Ywea  h, I have to. I'm thinking maybe tomorrow. My family (minus him) is actually going to be out for the night because they are going to the circus.  My mom wants me to go somewhere and stay the night lol. Fuck I think I'm gonna look for someone doing local nipple piercings under the table so I won't need an adult with me I'm counting on you craigslist Tomorrow night? Lol are you serious  That's such a bad idea  What if they aren't sterile And it gets infected  And it falls off like mine My aunt just came in today randomly She bought the ticket yesterday  l Yoesl , because she thinks it is weird when I am home alone with my grandpa. Of course I am not serious damn it. You really assume the worst ghettoxican in me, don't you? Well.. He had a shitty upbringing.. He's getting better lol like I suffered some severe medical injury - an upbringing from a pair of uneducatedxicans. I am going to wait until I turn  to see if I want the piercing.  That is what I have decided. 
The circus is everything but an extravaganza to me. I hate it when things try to force the spectacular and intense onto me. I would rather experience it on my own without those extreme expectations, because I get bored and get pissed off over the false advertising. What's up I'm at the family friend's house That's a good choice How was your day I like the Jean shot Ramadan bud d Iy l  ooked so good today with my jean shorts and my boots. Reyna and I have decided to clean out our closets and only keep the flattering things. It's also an act of discovering what flatters you. Cleaning out your closet, that is Well, I finished the book. Watched lots of OITNB. Went out for lunch. Grocery shopping. Wbu? How was your day? 
We are actually going to have a clothing exchange. Maybe we can do that tomorrow!! First we bring what we don't want and exchange it with each other, then we bag the leftover clothes and donate them to Buffalo and Plato's and get $$$ We can come over after work? I think we should totally go to Mady's housewarming party When is that?  How far are you into OITNB? Come over where? My aunt is over  Plus I don't really have clothes to give away I think But I'll check My day rocked Learned a lot About how gut bacteria are studied  You know, I work with fecal DNA? Nevermind I got the inv i Ptare ty this . Mady pretty much invited every single person who has ever  attended basis. Episode  So basically you can't have people over while your aunt is there? I guess as long as you are not dealing with the actual physical substance then that is fine hahah Must be strange to think about though Nicely subtle shot. *nice, Not really, no. She is very needy , June ,  No we do I mean I don't touch it, the forceps do Thx b My mentor from the lab used to work at cartel What's up with Reyna's pho n Iedk?
 Reyna and I are gonna be together tomorrow but we can drop by during your break Alright. I don't get a whole lot of notice for when that is going to be but it is usually about an hour long so hopefully you'll be able to come by Or really whenever if you come up  I mean you can stop by whene v Ie'mr
 going to assume noon because that is the general lunchtime so around then Possibly closer to  If things run as they did to d Kakky kk Nate and I have been discussing gender for the past hour and I feel so tempted to interrupt with the bad news Like all day it's been plaguing me ( Diviya would never forgive  y Hoe u is asking me questions about pronouns and telling me about his family and stuff I know Lol tell me What did he (s )a/ y at  tachment.PNG I also thought it was a good response ( )/ at  tachment.PNG Also look at how sad this is He never talks to anyone except for Diviya  but I guess it is about pronouns You know I really don't think about gender anymore. I couldn't describe my relationship to it if I wanted to. I guess this is what it is like to be cis... Did you actually switch to they? So Nate is pretty liberal and chill about these things but his fam ain't?  Yes that's very sad And what prompted your shift on gender fluidity? Was it talking to the ally gi r Hlis?
 family is okay with LGBQA. Trans isn't a thing to them. See, I have and still am questioning my gender and who I really am. It's not really discomfort with my body but discomfort with everything else, and I think that is fair, despite what you believe I hate the term femme male so much Or when you comment on my feminine masculinity It really hurts Why does it hu r It c? an't explain I honestly don't know Are you upset with me? I didn't feel comfortable telling you this first. Idk. I just told Diviya because she was there I don't know if I switched to they yet I have a lot of thinking to do My shift has been slowly occurring ever since I first read about it up to now Lol ally girl ain't have shit on me I was trying to talk to her about it but I assume she didn't even know what it was because her response was, yeah... Gender fluidity... It's a huuuuuge problem 
'To be honest, I don't have the most enlightened view on this according to the social justice minded, but my views are evolving and I'm open-minded about it, I'd like to think. But to me gender is how you feel about your body. Everything else is a societal construction- one can and should be whatever kind of male or female or other gender they desire to be no matter what society deems traditional or acceptable. I wasn't OK at all with my body and so I did what I did. I just do not understand gender questioning in the absence of physical dysphoria- to me many of the individuals with non-binary identities seem to express a rejection of societal gender roles in a way completely separate and disconnected from my personal experience. No I'm not upset. LOL @ her response Basically I think you do you glen coco and go with whatever pronouns make you happy but I don't consider most non-binary identifiers to be transgen d Ie cr
ompletely disagree with that statement. To me gender is more broad than the body, but I understand where you are coming from. Your view just wouldn't justify your need to adapt according to certain situations and around certain 'genders' or a change in voice or many other things. Actually I take back the voice But like interests and stuff Yeah I don't think voice is related... What do you m e aYon u go glen coco is the correct phrase I am aware Glen coco is a stand in name for anyo n Ie t  hink that non-binary is separate from transgender I don't consider them transgender either I didn't phrase that well To me, most non-binary people are their gender assigned at birth (cis) but   with a social identity that is atypical to that gen d Teo r me, the social identity is strong enough to be considered their gender Just because someone doesn't feel comfortable going under the knife doesn't invalidate their feelings Or their identity I suppose we've reached an impasse then. And we'll just have to agree to disagree. I don't think you have to have surgery to be trans, but you have to have discomfor t N.ob  ody says that gender fluidity is being trans  They are separate You know, it would be much more convenient if you were the trans one because you are significantly less transphobic No... Gender fluidity is under the trans umbrella  I'm still very hung up on the whole th i Fnorg
 me gender and sex are two different things. What you have described is sex. You can get a sex change and satisfy your gender. Under certain conditions it can be under the trans umbrella  It's funny you are lecturing me of all people about this.  
To me being trans is a very shameful thing to be hidden and never brought up. And I wonder if I influenced you to feel this way. I guess I am glad you don't see it in such a bad light but I am the type of person to never wish it on another human being. If not doing what I did (can't even say the word) was compatible with me not killing myself I wouldn't have done it no matter wha t O.ne 
 thing I can explain Is when you say you need a masculine man I feel like I will never completely reach either of those terms What if I said I liked tall guys. Would you be that hung up on that? I mean you probably will never be ' . But I don't think that would bother you as much. Why th i Is f? eel uncomfortable with my gender in these situations the same way you feel uncomfortable with your sex when it comes to having sex Wow fuck you ? What here was insulting? I'm sorry? Wasn't meant that way at  a Il'ml
 just sensitive about my gender but not my body Alright, I got you. I think I understand your definitions and feelings. And even if I don't fully, I respect your judgment and decisio n Is j. ust I think about what you would be feeling if I said this to you while you were transitioning And that's what really upsets me about this whole thing I understand that you are confused but I'm really sad right now I'm sorry. I think I am projecting some of my resentment towards myself into you, and I don't mean to be doing th a Atnd.
 I know this isn't comparable to being trans but I think that my topic is very sensitive to me and I don't have many sensitive topics And I also didn't know that this was such a big deal to you until right now, you just brought it up for the first time today after making fun of it for months.  But I'm sorry for fucking up when you needed support It's just a very hard topic for m e W.he  n you brought up the basketball thing, I felt that if I had brought that up when you talk about having a vagina instead of a penis and how it makes you sad or whatever, you would be super pissed off with me I think when I've mentioned that the way you feel about sex is how I feel about not satisfying you in a relationship, it's been a gender thing *not basketball, height In my head basketball and height connected hahah And this is why I constantly wonder why you are with me If you want a masculine man you should know that I can't be that You're saying that in the same way that you're supposed to only like dick but you're with me, I'm supposed to only like men but I'm with you? I am not primarily or exclusively attracted to masculine men, actuall y T.ha  t's not what I'm saying at all I'm saying that you feel like you can't satisfy because you aren't a masculine man In the same way I feel I can't satisfy you because lack of d i Icf k you brought up discomfort with your body and I threw in the height thing you would be upset. I would never discuss body preferences to you, and I want you to respect that when it comes to gender for me. I was just trying to say that people have preferences but dating outside of them is often no big deal. I'm sorry thou g Hhow.
 am I supposed to feel when you have literally told me that feminine guys aren't your thing When you said, I'm done with them Direct quote Yes I know but can we move past that That was one time I was being dumb I was up s Aendt
 if I said that I love penis up the ass I said something I didn't mean I get   Yiout
 would never move past that You're rig h Ttha. nk you for understanding I mean it And I care about you I feel like I can't even ask you what's up or change the subject right now I'm in such a daze My face is warm Ok and also you have made me realize that I have no body preferences Just the female hair though I feel like such a d i Ic wk onder if any of this changes the way you feel for me. I was upset for a while but I feel like the last thing I said perfectly captured my feelings Do you want me to express how I feel bluntly or to keep it to a later and less emotionally charged ti m Belu? ntly 
To some extent it is a point of pride for me to be with a cis gay guy, because it affirms my identity and helps me feel a part of mainstream culture. It doesn't change how I feel about you if you aren't, and I absolutely don't judge you for finding a deeper and truer understanding of who you are, but it is a bit like Toby saying that I made her realize she was pan and Anna that she was bi.  And I don't mean to make this about me But I wanted to get my feelings out into the open so they don't fes t Tehar t bothers me A LOT But I don't feel like commenting right now I would rather you just say what you have to say but if you don't feel like it that is   Aolsk o I'm probably being insensitive Insensitive to your sexuality 
But I think that if you were with me and I detached myself from my gender and you can no longer claim this identity because you are with a GQ person, then your feelings naturally shouldn't change and you should care about me regardless   When I think of love I don't refer to any mainstream or other people  I don't feel like I need to form a gay identity I think queer sums it up http//www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/aob/classic_joke_for_our_muslim_friends_tod a Lyik/ e what happens if I detach from this gender? Do I damage your sense of pride?  Why even be with me and risk that? Hahahah that's pretty funny, although a terrible generalization. It's not common, but not all Muslims keep Ramadan. 
I'm not going to leave you over this, because I already care about you too much, but if I were to meet another individual who off the bat said they were GQ or trans, I would not consider dating them. Again this too probably sounds insensitive to you. This predicament we are in is, to me, like the following 
A woman dates a man, Harold. They fall in love and marry. Harold later comes out as trans and they stay together and remain attracted to each other despite her discomfort that she eventually gets over because she loves this person. 
In an alternate universe, the same woman meets Helen. She used to be called Harold, but transitioned early in life. The woman is heterosexual and so the two become lifelong best friends and the woman does not consider ever going any furthe r
 .Ai  mee I really can't even believe you right now Really? I don't think that is a fair criticism of the joke. That specific group of Muslims follows Ramadan. They would probably bend the rules if they were told the full sto r Iy d. o not understand how someone could be unaccepting when I am the same person with the same body This doesn't affect you significantly Fuck, man No it doesn't affect you and   Ymoue
 think that GQ opens potential trans No I don't But in the same way that everyone is allowed preferences, I am too I am sure there are many  we are friends with that would not date anyone trans or GQ  And just because I am trans doesn't exempt me from feeling the same wa y I. u  nderstand that, but consider this Actually never mind it doesn't even matter anymore No please go ah e Aagad in, I feel like if I said these things to you while you were transitioning and we were in a relationship you would be upset But I can't think of a good analogy and I'm too upset to do that Well, I agree that I should have had more restraint in the first blunt statement, but after that I was just answering your questio n Lsik  e if i just told you that I care about you but I really want dick in the future Was I supposed to lie No you're right that would h u Arndt
 that if I meet another trans guy with the original genitalia then I don't want a relationship  No you're not supposed to lie, but idk It makes me really really really fucking sad I have been so open minded when it comes to you I kno w T hi( s just really makes me upset Aimee I can't even talk to you right now I actually do not want to talk to you I'm so hurt Don't even reply I'll text you tomorrow if I feel better, goodnight goodni g Yhout
 know what actually I respect your opinions  And while it is hurtful it is just your preferences It does not even matter to me I wish you would be more sensitive and open to these things but if you care about me then I guess that is what matters And if you just want to break up then that is alright too How am I supposed to feel comfortable with someone who is not comfortable with me I did cry and I did feel like shit and for so long I have repeated what you said to me that one  day after school pertaining to my masculinity and femininity And for so long I have wondered why you continue to like me when I am not what you want When I am not the person you prefer 
I know you said not to reply but I wish I could speak to you face to face. I see very clearly how I hurt you, and I sincerely sincerely didn't mean to. I care for you so much, I just don't have a good reading for what will upset you regarding this topic yet, though some things I can obviously see how they would be hurtful, and that was completely my fault. I hate to see you like this. I care about you so so much and it wouldn't make a difference to me if you were anything, including trans. And I'm not in any way implying you are, but even if you lost your dick tomorrow I would still be attracted to you and would find new ways to make you happy with whatever new identity you forge for yourself. I would proudly call you by dabae pronouns if that is what you decided would fit yo u (. M  e A lt( hough I can not say I am not upset anymore, I can say that this was the right step forward, and I deeply appreciate your efforts and your commitment to me and to our relationship.  
It meant the world to me. The first time I read it I cried for a few minutes, and the second time I laughed, but I think that no matter how you feel about it, your willingness to accept me is beautiful and I am lucky for that and to have you. I will never be the strong, macho man to carry you away, but I will love you no matter what.  For as long as we are together No matter who I am I will continue to try my best to make you happy and work within my power to satisfy you. S hi) ft from ( to ) over the course of  texts Why are you still up and you were up later than usual last night too Because of you lol But I'm going to sleep now so goodnight I value our conversation though so it's nbd Worthwh i Allre ighty, sleep tighty. goodnighty 🐸 Will I see you today?

Basically in my dream we saw the wizard of oz for free at ATC and you gave me some free weed that got me paranoid because I did it in my house Did you watch the wizard of oz while stoned Cos that would be tri p Ipf y you guys are gonna show that kid downtown I'm actually probably gonna be doing something else I don't think we will do that I thought it through right after typ i Hnahg ha no. I had to leave early because my mom came to pick me up early and you droned on and on during the show with this leukemia donation director about fashion (Which I didn't know you were so knowledgable about!) Oh ok then. Jay can't come to the party because he gets off work at midnight He could still come  t Hbe h wants to come with Elizabeth though So he said he probably won't Ok, does that fact cause you to not want to  g Yoes? .. I just... I do not know if it may be possible to bear a night of debauchery without Jayant!! Lol I don't care. I thought you would want to know though. I thought he was in Atlanta so I thought he wouldn't c o Hme'e s leaving in  That's why he can't do my birthday Or his, for that matter. Hi What's   Hueyp

 some reason those omelettes look super unappetizing. I know they tried to have a nice aesthetic but I can't overlook the sliminess, ehh. We need to organize a riot for this Tucson shit. Unacceptable. Ok just kidding actually. I feel like that was well deserved. The man created such an unnecessary raucous and disruption, putting the citizens of Tucson's lives in danger. The news didn't specify what race the man was though. #RacistMainstreadia #ControversialWhenBlack I don't like undercooked eggs either I just thought the weaved avocado was cool They were only shooting his car Not at  h Iin m one photo it looks like cum was drizzled over the eggs Just to stop whe e Plros bably not the most legal thing to do but I guess if there isn't any other way to stop him Potentially endangering citizens but it's not like the guy is doing any better So you are American? lol that is terrible If someone wrote that about black people.... To be honest, here in America % of people wish that [slavery would have killed them all] ( points) Well also racism is more conspicuous in Europe so there's that factor Still not okay... I think internet culture should help them not be so ignorant to that It's very legal... And standard.. They are good at shooting in a directed way But you're right it seems pretty busy an area to be shootin Shooting Are you gonna go to church I don't think Americans believe that at  a Yleal h ( sorry b, I'll talk to you later. Today's sermon was how the friendships we make in the church are more valuable than any other friendships because of a shared belief...  I'm not saying Americans believe that, but it would be so controversial if that was a comment  Like more than gypsies  Do you still think Oregon/Washington trip is viable  I honestly can not believe I used to be so religious, fuck. It makes me sick to think about. I hear the things said during services and I can't even believe how blinded I was. How far down the religious rabbit hole were you? Did you really buy it ally All? And maybe... Like end of ? Today I slept, cleaned my room and did some laundry. I'm gonna work on Python and maybe make some soup. It has been a good  d Haeyy That sounds awesome! I slept and went to church and I went swimming and now I'm eating chips w beans and guac and a burger soon Well I mean I wanted to preach soooo pretty far down. Also I remember how I made a promise to always tithe and donate money when I had a job. Did you end up working on that stuff? If I end up working all of  most of my money will probably go for a trip of some kind I'm hanging out with this kid I used to be friends with from elementary school and his dad died so he has really bad depression  It's so awkward They're really rich though. All the food from whole foods and they have an outdoor speaker system. My brothers stayed in their guest house while my mom went out last Bught  *night My mom is tanning with her new boy so the kids are all sitting together lol those two examples aren't my image of rich But I gotchu Isn't he the old guy? I bought supplies for soup Still need to get started Gonna be up late tonight because I woke up around noon How is the job hunt going How gross boys are to Reyna  http//i.imgur.com/imEKCC.j p Wgel l I mean they have a big house near the Simbas. They go a bunch of places.  Nope! Of course, new guy this time. He's Italian and nice and tan and actually super attractive. He's an airplane mechanic. They met maybe two weeks ago. She left the other guy because he was active on a dating site when they were together. What kind of soup is it? Actually since you got your job Reyna and I are looking at places together You basically just sent a selfie? Did you mean to send that? Jk lol Is he mentally stable It's a Native American soup. Corn, squash, and beans, primarily Anything back from bookman's? But weren't they just casually dating? Or was he actually cheati n Hge'  s the son of the old lady who almost died.... Probably a pity thing tbh. That actually sounds awesome. I know I left the other soup but you should probably keep some leftovers. Not yet ( but Reyna and I are thinking DQ and Target Maybe I will be the next Alex at Target They were planning on getting married. she checked when he was last active on the site and it was pretty recent so she ended it. I heard DQ was disgusting, but probably a fun job regardless Ouch. Chipotle? Sunday, June ,  What's   Wuhyp
 is Father's Day acceptable to celebrate but not Mother's Day Omg chipotle is intense. They are all about team building and exercises and shit like that. Too much training. I was just sleeping wbu ( )/ at  tachment.JPG FWD to  or more people or Candace will haunt you in your sleep! AIMEERE Hi I just ate my stew I wasn't a huge fan but the fam loved it so that's good. It said to put in squash for pork as a vegetarian option, but the squash was uncomfortably sweet.  Ah gotcha They are one of those near minimum wage places that like to think of themselves as a career Fucking Evangelical Africans( )/ at  tachment.png Bisbee tomorrow? Answer me beyo t Tchah t reminds me! I harvested squash from the farm and I have been meaning to make a squash boat for you. Lol not really a career, but more career readiness skills that other minimum wage places won't provide. That's Christian in general? It's weird to me that they would send out a mass email for something like that. I mean even after you probably even specified that you are Jewish and shit. ( My grandfather is considered my father on Father's Day so... They send out an email every day With all sorts of announcements of this k i In ad m actually so sad that I can't go. I bought a crop top for the occasion. So any group can advertise A nd(
 then they're like oh hahah I know you probably feel left out that you don't have a dad (( YOouk
 never answered me about why Father's Day but not Mother's Day  Answer me bewitch *beyotch My neck hurts so bad and I have mosquito bites all over ( I don't have an answer, I don't think one is unacceptable  I ended up doing Mother's Day I actually don't have many Or if I do they are not itchy Why neck p a Wieln l I remember you judged the hell out of Mother's Day and it felt like you thought it was just another day I guess what you did judge was how much meaning is associated with it Which is problematic for me I just don't think it's as big of a deal as your mother guilts you into feeling like it   Miins e aren't itchy until I touch them. I only notice them when I feel my body. Neck pain because idk. I was diving and didn't maintain good form It's not that I don't think it's meaning f Iu fl eel like I would be the worst parent ever So I can't even risk it I just don't believe really in expression of care through buying people shit  Don't really believe * shit I am tired Why would you be the worst parent Eh, if it doesn't work out there is always adopti o Hnah! ah and you thought you would be up so late The buying stuff is exactly how my father tried to make up years of abuse lol He didn't call me or see me or anything but sent gifts Because I feel like it is too much of a responsibility to be in charge of creating a personality and guiding them. I would surely fuck up somewhere along the way. There are also so many risks one takes when having a child.  Hahahahahah I do get along pretty well with Alex though. Goodnight!!!! HHeyi
 what's up How is your Father's Day going What are you doing today Hi I am watching OITNB so pretty good Wbu? What have you done and what is your plan I might work on Python and I might do another load of laun d Wrhay t episode are you on? I was so upset because my mom took my grandpa out to breakfast without me because she thought I was asleep When really I was planning my bday stuff Which, btw, is going to be awesome!!! Although Diviya and I have to stay  nights I am going to go see Inside Out. Today I did laundry and planned the bday thing and listened to a bunch of music. Also what did I tell you The king of not addressing things from the night before 😝😝😝 We haven't gone out together in a long time Eh I thought you came to a good conclusion of your points I am at the end of ep  How are you gonna pay for it? Do you know yet? That is true When are you availab l Neo, 
 it is too late to address the points now. This season focused more on relationships and love and stuff rather than backstabbing and elaborate schemes. It's $ for two nights, so splitting isn't bad for me. Also I give up because bookmans is being a little bitch so I'm going to try eegee's and sonic and target  Yeah like I only ever see you to pick up other people or to drive to go meet others lol The last time we hung out is SAAF volunteering day I think Tonight maybe and definitely every day/night after  Oh that's pretty good. What's the plan so far if you wish to share? I wasn't going to address the points? What is Bookman's doing? I'm busy  and  So tonight it must  b Seo  
the food is all middle eastern (guess who decided that) and we are arriving on  because the condition is that you stay two nights. It'll probably be close people the first night and then the second night is the actual party. Diviya's mom is going to drive some people up and probably food then too.  Is it gonna be no alcohol too, in keeping with the middle eastern theme? And no homosexuality? Are we stoning adulterers (Diviya)? B oo)
kman's is super unresponsive, but I've been reading this blog and they're on some power trip because they think they are the coolest hipster bookstore around. Kinda true, but doesn't mean they can spontaneously fire people in order to attain the most hipster clerk in Tucson. If it's just one blog saying that, they are probably just bit taar aaaybe tonight. We are having Father's Day lasagna night at  lol But the unresponsive bit is legit Ok then never mind I can't be out past like  anyway And I'm actually sticking to , otherwise it's gonna set me up for a shitty w e Neo k no, the theme is Lana and the food is Arab. Diviya is one clever little bitch. Lana gives lots of leeway  It's middle eastern orditerranean not Arab Israeli food is much the s a Bmute
 who started the trend Jk jk  Potentially stoning Martha too for adultery  Guys, if I do anything with someone else while Ahmad is gone you can't tell him But then she broke up a month later She didn't act on it  t Shheo
 would But she didn't Which is a big differe n Icf e I said that about you to my friends... Can't jail someone for thinking about murder i Lnikg e if I said that but replaced it with your name I'm not saying it's not bitchy But it's clearly not adult e Drefy initely no homosexuality though Even if we aren't following the path of Islam Nature created its own righteousness In the form of AIDS ( Am I texting J a ?y? ? What You sounded like him 'Twas a j o Ik te hought you wanted me to guess if you were texting him or not lol Am I texting Jay? *emphasis on the I* Italics, actually You aren't texting Jay but you would be texting my grandpa I grew up in the st century believing that AIDS was the gay disease( )/ at  tachment.PNG I honestly love this but everyone thinks it's too fucked up Don't you think that when you move out you will be able to show your best sense of style I always think that about myself It's a very Tess kind of comic No bc I'll be broke, and no one is limiting my style now But I can see how that would be true for you Does gpa still feel that  w Tahey re is a reason I don't wear my yellow pants lol He does. When we were going to volunteer at SAAF he made a face and then didn't comment. Anyway have a good day I wonder if the top screening room at the loft is handicap accessible  Hi It is probably not If you have under  employees it is not a requirement I don't wear mine cos they are unflattering P What else would you w e Hai r Inside out was so cute! What wasn't cute though were all the families dressed up in the same outfits at the mall And the long lines of family It seems weird that people would find the mall an ideal Father's Day place Maybe women who are into single dads come and scope them out I actually did not know that That's a good fact to know. In case I'm ever disabled. I can't actually describe specific outfits but look up Malcolm Robinson on fb  Everything he would wear Or everything in American Apparel What's up? Mary Janes! And Reyna shoes Bitchhhh I once had all these ideas about what I wanted to wear but then I realized it takes one of two things Either $$$ or amazing sewing and fashion talent He's awesome tho While looking him up I found out that Malcolm neifeld is biking across England I always thought he was poor white trash I might go see inside out My aunt keeps bitching at me about my lemon bars because she thinks they are undercooked. She just doesn't know how lemon bars work cis she foreign (AKA inferior) Lol I cannot imagine you in Mary Jane's. They are so basic and like  school girl! I see where you got the one drop of ethnic blood line OITNB I still disagree with it though. It's about visibility. Luka is half native, but blonde, so he is white to us a l Wlha. t about people who turn thrift stores into Gucci That in itself is a real talent That is who I aspire to be They spend hours and hours A shit ton of time looking  Seriously it's a lot of work to find the gold th e rcie s she foreign cis people just never understand ANYTHING!!! Ugh. Tell me about it. But the Mary Jane's with sass and height. Like the Reyna shoe. Hahah yeah. What about albino people? Or what about Arabs? They could all lookxican. It's strange how the minority part of you is your identity Also I can't believe luka is half Native American Can you make lemon bars for the party!!! I forgot to mention that the party is a potluck. Diviya said we would cover food but we are literally having aditerranean cooking day. which means we won't have  a lot 
Maybe I don't connect the seniors because of the privilege gap. I mean they are like all white cis hetero fuckers. A couple aren't white but still cis and hetero (or bi but not in a same-sex relationship, which basically means hetero) Yeah I can do t h Tahet y aren't white but mostly Asian (which is like extreme white) or rich. Your grade is full of white girls who say hella What's so different about my grade? Like I've talked to everyone in my grade This dinner is the most awkward thing ever. It was half an hour of my grandpa's biological daughter answering questions about how she made her food. Literally. Luckily the biological grandson who killed the cat smokes, so he was able to go outside and escape It's over now thank god My grade has SJ people who aren't bitchy about it I actually consider myself one of them Not that many are asian in my grade Still many white girls  And yes. Hella Diviya and who else? I still dislike the SJWs Or their philosophy at least Is the dinner ending? Idk your grade is just more open Less uptight Less traditionally high schoo l Yeesr
 it's over. It was awful. Even the people who were white had their ethnic best friend. Like Eric Arellano and Malec. Parthib  Lots of the Hispanic people were white, like ethnically Hispanic but racially white Amanda, Vicky, Larissa, eric He n Drivy iya, Martha, more Nate now, Paige, Nina, Annika, etc. Martha is not AJ SJ Is Nina, really? I did not know that To me a vital component of SJism is not only holding the progressive views, but being outspo k Neinn a's huge on sexual assault Calling people out Martha doesn't do that, at least I haven't witnessed   Sihet
 called out Reyna for masturbating because it was a violation of her body Lol LOL that's not really SJ tho That's just we i Brutd
 now she has sex SOOO She is outspoken about class warfare I think I only said Martha by association with Diviya  We do have some boring people though. Samer, Eva, Casey, Sumeet, Keshav, straight boys, Rainy, Francisco Nina posts stuff on her Facebook about single moms and shit Sexualizing bodies She's very feminist and outspoken about sexual harassment and rape Thank God she found Ivan Sumeet has his own social thing going on Why Iv a Rnig? ht. Robotics. Like why did she pick him And Eva too with the J e Twhes y are both into the underground, obscure culture thing. She loves his music. They are both people who love to argue and they are both outspoken about their beliefs. They talk and talk and talk and talk. She would be Woody Allen's perfect companion She's just young enough for h i Amls  o she says he makes her feel secure Lol How do you feel about incestuous relationships Nice in porn, not reality What's   Muayp be nice in reality if nobody finds out And both are single  Nothing really. Finished an application for Panera. Then I started sonic but accidentally attached my mom's resume so I gave up lol. Listening to music Wbu We totally could have gone out ugh It's so stupid because the eegee's applications say Position - Store # but they don't specify where that store is and if you look up eegee's store  or whatever you can't find it Hey sorry I totally missed your texts Missed notification idk That's really dumb  Hopefully the job hunt works out s o Io an m so horny Though I fear your applications centered on trendy joints will make shit more difficult I am too  b Iu'vt e jerked off three times in the past day I was about to go to sleep...
 too but that's normal for   Omk e well ? M( e Wish we could have gone out tonight Did you jerk off to invest? Inc e Hsaht ah no I've been thinking about our past sexual experiences and anal Anyway I was watching OITNB and it reminded me of the Diviya TSA experience But anyway yeah Good night ? I think it might actually w o Ork k cool I'll see Goodnight , June ,  
 This interaction between pipet and daya about wealth Literally me 
 bedrooms, housekeeper not maid, ballet lessons Money only buys happiness up to k! [thinking K is like nothing and daya gives a look].... oh I guess that's a lot I meant  bathrooms Piper My aunt is arguing with me about whether our aunt Jemima is maple
Syrup. This is the result of a linguistic difference- all normal syrup is called maple in Israel, but priced pretty damn high. After tasting it, she is nearly sure it is maple. And that maple comes from a cedar tree. I concede. It's not worth arguing.  She also doesn't know that the fake maple in Israel is fa k Teha 
t scene literally reminded me of you. I feel like I am dating Piper and I am on of thexicans. Still more educated than the blacks; we have cultural intuition! That is actually probably why Reyna and I think that, you know, what we told you at cartel. I don't think that is a linguistic difference if the label on Israeli syrup says maple when it's really cedar... The cedar point was separate It's not actually cedar She's just very wr o Anlsg o, I am surprised that Mr. -Bathrooms Ballet Housekeeper's family bought Aunt Jemima syrup! I expected some agave or prickly pear out of you guys. Way to not meet my expectations. Anyway  Have a good day. Sorry if I offended you. Lol Ima snot offended I'm not What a fantastic autocorrect We have agave And we just ran out of maple Only reason we have the shitty stuff is that no one uses it I use agave or maple Can you be flacka? I like her Those boot i Deo s you want to do something after scouts I can't do anything tomorrow at all No time Kinda need to know soon though Hey Come to black crown if you want I'm h e Crane
 u get me or no? K well I'll see you around  When are you done at sco u s Hi What is   Euatp ing at subway Abu Wbu How was your day I didn't respond earlier bc I thought you were busy , June   S,le  epover is off btw Why is it off? My day was great, I love working in the  l Aalsb o sorry I was so bitchy today. But I didn't do anything special It's ok it really wasn't that bitchy I am at home  Might watch OI T RNeyB na and I just didn't want to see Martha  How was your day Are you serious That's really bitchy Like REALLY bit c Whe y just can't stand lab talk nobody else understands except you two You complain I'm so symbolic but you should look at her We literally didn't talk abou that With Diviya like at all If you guys don't want us to talk at all about that you need to be more active in the conversation Because you two hardly talk That's really mean And really not a good reason You could just tell her not to talk about th a Otff 
 because Bella feels sick My day was great. Cleaned the turtle pond, pulled weeds, cartel in afternoon, thrifting, tea, and epic cafe Yeah when we last had a coffee night it was literally Martha showing us texts with guys she thinks like her And you say I'm not active You only talk to her so much because you literally work with her every fucking day And because she got you a job I've tried talking to her and having interesting conversations with her but it is literally boys boys boys and texts texts texts We used to be closer But you guys could have mentioned bowling or something  Why couldn't you get me tonight? I really don't understand We actually talk about a lot of things, and I think the job brought us closer but the relationship isn't all about that at all  We decided to go bowling spontaneously It wasn't a plan It was because you guys weren't there and we wanted to kill time until Diviya came, but she came early But it was pretty bitchy to get pissed about that. You do so much stuff without me.  I thought you got off  a Wthe  never I do stuff without you you are with the seniors or whatever And I almost always invite you And they were gonna leave at  so it would have ended the night with them if I left, plus I wanted to go to sleep before like  which wasn't realistic if I went out with you at  Not true at all Like your Reyna and Bella nights recently, or Jen, or Za y In ga ot off at  too Right, I thought it was  But the late issue still persi s Otkas y well those are during the day when you are busy Now yes, but not in the past And it's not like we didn't invite you to d Wahyy
 does it matter Because you were unreasonably upset today and I am trying to show you it is unreasona b Ilt'e s not like I wanted to see a movie or anything like I would not have even kept you out late ok but still It would be past then I know   Oukas y It's over though It's not a big deal It was a misunderstand i Onkag y Seriously it's not like we will explode if we don't hang out alone for a bit It will happen! It has just been a busy while And stop okay'ing me instead of saying what you want to  s Waely l you already know what We won't explode It's fine Anyway, I'm leaving for a week this Sunday Glad we have come to agreem e Sno t I wanted to do something To where? We will do something don't wo r Ir dy on't think it's that fucking unreasonable to want to be with you But I'm just upset rn  Camp 
I don't think it's unreasonable I just think you ought to realize the circumstances, and that just because it didn't work out today (after you told me to anticipate that it wouldn't work out today) doesn't mean it won't work out all w e Beutk
 there really aren't any restricting circumstances  We could have done something the past week or whatever We choose to go with the crowd And I don't object to that, but I'm just saying It's not like there isn't any time to do things alone I'm sad that I didn't make more time or ask you to do something And even if we don't do anything this week I would understand, idc It's really not a big deal sergio, we can hang out this week, no reason to be regretful or sad about it, seriou s Olkay y Ok I'm going to sleep, so good night. I hope you feel better about whatever is actually getting you down because I feel like it is something deeper. This really isn't big enough of an issue to make you this ups e Wtha. t the fuck Okay whatever then How can you invalidate my reason like that. Because I really thought it was true Diviya said you were being weird too tod a Syhe 
 was being very weird She said you two third wheeled her hardcore And spoke about things in front of her but wouldn't include her And so she l e Wfe t invited her to a movie... I don't think she understood that She literally said you guys talked about a movie and didn't invite  h Tehir s is good I feel like we just need to release some stuff Thanks! I thought you were going to sleep Then I got dragged into  
 fI'b m sorry Are you upset with me? No, I just think you need to realize your role in relationships more, and put yourself in the shoes of others. Like to all of us you were being super weird today Like saying we couldn't hang out because you were busy Being bitchy about the bowling  p Oikac y And t h ?a Mt e That's really passive aggress i Wvele l I realize you are wrong, I'm upset with myself for it, I don't know what else you want me to say *you are right That's a far better response than Ok a Wyhe n is Elliot's thing 
 ni g Ohkat y Are you going to bed now AYlra ight ( What do you want to do tomorrow? Or does  work best? 
 is better Actually  Is alright But it would be at like  But tonight might also w o Sro k Diviya and Martha and I were gonna talk things out tonight over coffee But Diviya said I don't respect her because I accused her of cheating (?!!!!!!???!???!?? That pissed me off) and accused her of flirting with Marcus  So I said that maybe we do need time apart because she doesn't value my openness with that kind of stuff and that I respect her enough to tell her what I think about it Oh ok, then Wednesd a Tyhe! n she Unfriended me W h Iat t was crazy By the way, time apart is like never a good option ser g Ii wo as up until  am ( Is that why she left the gro u Ip t? old her that we need to think about what this means before we say this Like to you the answer to difficulty is time apart but I don't think that's true But that's true, you all should think before acting ras h li y spend so much time with him because i feel like I'm losing all my friends and he is away from all of his. We bond over our loneliness -about Marcus Yes. She wants time away from us. Nah, I've also come to realize that I don't like time apart We had such a great time last night  Is your bday o f Afnd?
 if I do then I'm not going to say it Things will probably be mended by t h Tehan t's also what I think But is it alright if i just have this night with Martha? Yeah that's f i Snhee
 said last night she was upset She feels like she doesn't belong Maybe she is ostracizing herself because she feels guilt It's like when you pull yourself away from your partner when you che a It d  on't know why she said she didn't cheat because she literally did Idk what she calls cuddling and making out with another guy I told her my opinion on it and she got upset Then she said that she hasn't felt the spark she used to feel with Nate, but also she hasn't seen him in  weeks Ok well Martha's parents want her home for family dinner so It makes me uncomfortable how involved you are in this shit. I feel like I can't tell you anything. Someone else already probably has, you know? Anyway, I don't really know anymore It's like we aren't in a relationship together anymore But everyone else is in it too. Completely expanded. I'm not even involved in this I don't know what's going on I have no an g Slure e but it still creates problems like last night. I feel the way you probably did when you left basis and I stayed behind  Ok but it's really not that big of a deal. We won't talk about it in front of you, that's it. It's fine Like this whole thing could easily be avoided through basic communicati o Ynea  h I know it's all good ❤️❤️❤️ I wouldn't have been upset if you said it bothered  y Doonu 't be upset or whatever  I'm not up(s )e/ t at  tachment.JPG Literally I am not upset I just don't get all this fighting That seems totally unnecess a Nro y I know but I want us all to be happy Like Martha literally wasn't mad at you at all You said there was bitchiness between you two but really you were just mad at  h Tehar t's true but I cleared it up and explained it to her Ok what's the problem with Divi(y )a/ ? at  tachment.PNG Ok but how did this even start Like what led to t h Rieys na and I made plans in front of her And she was upset about what I said about Marcus Like that day in black crown This will blow over, just let it be Dumb   IA cF an't wait to show you my new bags!!! How is your day going so far What's your plan tonight Bags? My day is going pretty good I have a bass lesson and I might go to the family friend after, don't know yet. We didn't get much done because the chemical hoods were down for maintena(n )c/ e at  tachment.JPG My bags You know I feel like part of this issue stemmed from the fact that I decided to tell you more about my day because you said I was always vague, so I give you the details and then it is all biology Nice bags, love the hairy Shitt Sh(i )r/ t at  tachment.JPG( )/ at  tachment.JPG I actually don't think so. It doesn't bother me when you do it. In groups, yes. You look so angry and long legged in the last ph(o )t/ o at  tachment.JPG You know that I love you boy, hot like Africa, rejoice - Reyna Attempting to sing Alejandro But I'm sorry the hood was down ( hopefully you got to be productive in other ways What is up Isn't that correct lyri c Hsey?
 boy I had this amazing chicken breast and honey mustard sandwich with clam chowder soup on th ave. More photo shoots hahah No no, it's hot likexico What's up with you Nate has been complaining to me about Diviya and the relationship  I've changed into  different outfits today How is your sex drive? My mom used Netflix for the first time in her life last night and she watched a Jennifer Lopez movie What restaurant? I just got home, leaving to bass soon What is Nate saying My sex drive is gr How is yours Why j Lo? Ew Love her but not her mov i Iet s was at bison witches! Very very cool. Well Reyna and I don't know what to do. We were supposed to see a movie but idk. My sex drive is too high to handle if you catch what I'm saying !!! ! ! ! Nate just told me basically what Diviya said. She wants him to be meaner, she doesn't feel a spark, she feels numb, etc.  Lol I know. J Lo's movies are super lame If you don't go with family friend you should come with me Yeah I'll be f r Ie'me
 still on th rn. I think I'm going home soon so I'll be there ( for Nate Honestly the best thing for all parties would probably be a break   Fuorp
 all parties including us? Or their breakup benefiting the group? No I mean both of t h Deo m you want one of those coolxican candles for your bath? Kinda over my candle phase But than k Hsah! ah alright. Maybe you can wait at the Starbucks until I get home or I'll let you know where I am when you get out of bass. Have a good lesson! I'm done what's  u Opk   so I'm on Speedway and Kolb. Kinda close to my house. Ok let me know when you get there I'm just nea r Hbahy ah I see you I'll be out soon ? K , June   O,h   yeah yesterday I went to magpies on th to apply for a job and Emily Jue was the one to give/take our applications and it was such a transformation for her to see from th to th grade me. Also the people of Karachi, Pakistan are experiencing a heatwave and because they are keeping Ramadan over  people have died ( Did she say anything Did I ever tell you that my jew choir co director/ synagogue musical director was murdered a few years  a .g..o ... Murdered is pretty intense That's really sad tho Yeah her ex boyfriend stabbed her Cos he was jealous that she moved   Sohen
 was like wow.... You're a senior and she looked really surprised to see me She was just a quiet sweet older la d Hyow 
 did you hear about it?? That's soooo fucking sad Like I knew her personal l Iy m  ean I could understand getting upset but never to the point of homicide That happens in the book I'm reading and the hate process (to the point where you want to kill) is explained I remember she told me I was a pretty soprano and that I needed to sing louder because it was nice, even though I choked during the audit i Tohen y make it sounds beautiful It was very not beautiful to see it happen to  h Teher re is no way you used to be a soprano Holy shit When did that change? When did you decide to change your voice? No, I understand, but it never hit me that things like that were not as poetic as the book makes it sound. Like You don't consider it until you hear about it really happening No I was an alto A low alto Like basically a tenor I just had a lot of range For the purposes of that choir I could have been a soprano They only divided into soprano and alto despite the fact that they had guys, so the sopranos were also mezzo sopranos and high altos But yeah I just had a lot of range. I could go tenor up to maybe mezzo Changed it maybe th gra d Seom  eone just tapped my window So scary lol almost died #eastside You want to know something sad My church choir literally did not care about technique whatsoever The kids in my choir did not sing according to their capabilities. We all sang songs in unison regardless. I feel like I really missed out on a lot of this terminology because I am lost I mean I did play guitar but voices are different Wtf are they go n Ie h  ope so. Did your current house get broken into or was it the winter haven one? The ADT commercials fucked my childhood up This one But I think we left the back door open How it works is Highest-lowest female voice Sopranozzosoprano Alto (Contralto) Highest- lowest male voice (Counter tenor) Tenor Baritone Bass I'm a bass  n Tohew n why is it that sometimes people refer to males using the female scale? What do you think I am? They may have a range more comparable to one of the female voi c Aelss o, tomorrow are we doing something? Because if not I got invited to wyatt's house lol. You could probably come. He is making his guests coffee/tea Like Chris colfer or especially alex Newell What t i Omh e shit it's at  in the afternoon. Might be a little awkward, idk. Oh yes Chris colfer. So if you're a bass then I am probably baritone Probably Good night boy Maybe a baritenor That is the golden voice, they say A low tenor/high barit o Onh e I was half reading that and I thought you said good night my golden boy But you didn't say that, so I will hahaha Good night my golden boy 💛☀️😘 HHeyi , how was your day? Really fantastic The highlight was Martha's dad asking bitchy questions that were really just statements to the other researcher during a meeting because she kind of stole his work and then conducted it poorly Also I did my own fecal DNA extraction all by myself W b Huah? aha remember when you thought Martha's dad was scary because he asked about your backpack Congratulations haha!! Btw Veris meant what's appropriate for the camping trip because he doesn't know who is going Like the substances Today I went out for breakfast, looked around at clothes, bought hiking shoes, got lunch at somexican place, then went to wyatts. I'm still here Madeleine is coming What's up with you I just finished getting a haircut Oh Whoops What's your plan for toni g Ahret
 you going to mt lemmon ?? Guess so Martha brought it up today as if I was in on the plan I wasn't but I am  n Wohyw
 now?? I 'm?
 not going Because she told me about it W Whhoy
 can drive and what is going on up there Madeleine just asked me if I was going with you on  and I said idk what was going on My plan for tonight is uncertain. I'm w Reyna and Madeleine and Wyatt now Ok I'm free if you down. Let's talk about the camping when we meet up Or I could come there if that's not  a Iw dk idn't know it was camping Oh right maybe  n Ook t well I mean you could come to wyatts but we are just sitting at this table drinking tea And talking Do you want the address or do you want to do something after? When do you plan on leavi n Mgay? be you can come pick me and Reyna up at  
 E th st Aight  On my way Prolly  H e lrole ? ?? ??? Bi t Och h hi sorry Ok be put Killin me boo , June(  ),/   at  tachment.jpg( )/ at  tachment.PNG Also omgggggg I have always agreed with the sentiment of that comic That the north has as much if not more of a race problem, it's just more subtle. In the south people are either racist or not, but not the inbetween  b Tshe  y get the nice white picket fence and we get the plain metal gate Why omg? W Ient entional haha. Yeah I hate how even here the people won't acknowledge that they are being indirectly racist (like me) Well Nate was telling me he feels uneasy with his relationship sometimes Like when Diviya went to hang out and drink with the Arab kids and the guy came onto her And he says that he was only gone for a few weeks and that happened. Then he said if he were apart from her for two months he worries about if she would be faithful. Sorry the preview of the pic cut off the text So I was just like what I'm the same way Also indirectly racist like you, that is But when will they be apart for so long? I mean he doesn't have any illusions that she isn't going to stay with him indefinitely, rig h Tthe?
 two months was him talking about being apart for SRPs. He thinks they're going to be together until they leave for college, kinda like us. Oh Y e Aalsh o it's weird how we claim to be so progressive but it's just inherently who we are I don't claim to be progress i Avlte hough I feel like if a person of any skin color was wearing baggy clothing and bling then I would be uncomfortable  Anyway goodnight!! 😜 Sorry I spaced Good ni(g )h/ t at  tachment.jpeg The eggs in my house are literally frozen.( )/ at  tachment.jpeg Sup We i Wratd ching inglourious basterds and eating custard.

That looks yummier than your eggs . W.ow. . My eggs turned out pretty well, thank you very much. I did have to throw out some frozen egg yolk from the pan though, lol. Nah the stores sell it now, kinda like how in store gelato was a trend. That picture when white people try to make 'ethnic' food White people have recipes...

Reyna would probably also feel more comfortable  It would be you, me, Diviya, Nate, Martha, Reyna, and Madeleine (?) We could swim So ya? No sorry Let me think about it but I don't think so At least not with substan c Wee dos n't have any anyway but ok Don't be salty bruh Maybe we can go get coffee and see where things   Logl no o I'm not, but I can't really know last minute otherwise my mom will be upset that I didn't stay the night (it's either that or babysit). Also Reyna has to know if she is going to stay the night with u or family And basically I want nudes Jk I guess I'll bring my bag just in case and tell Reyna the same So what is the plan? Sorry b I am at work Ya see Sorry I can't confirm  y Seend t nudes in the bathroom Jk lol. I'm gonna do it one day though So I'm meeting Reyna at cartel around  and we are both bringing backup clothes. We kinda wanted to go to casa video and pick out movies too. WHAT THE FUCK HOLY SHIT Shit I am so r 🔥r🔥???y ???🔥 No no no, I just didn't think you would Didn't know you were a bad boy ;) Ughhhh quiero tener sexo contigo  I actually can't believe you did that I'm so happy It is so funny haha ;) ) What's   Geuttip ng ready to go to cartel, wbu?

You give noooo fucks when it comes to that. I've always wondered how other people manage with that when they sleep over. Nobody ever seems to fart. I wonder if the current manager at McDonald's is satisfied with his job and his life Reyna's parents story makes me sad That's a dumb reason  Well maybe she wanted to go out but there is not $ ( And yea! Honestly it's amazing that she is so successful and not fucked up given that backgro u I nalwd ays feel gross going to McDonald's because the burgers are so small and you can eat three without realizing you had  calories. There's food at home.. She said she didn't want to be alone when she took my brother to play at McDonald's, I could never imagine a parent showing their kid different types of cocaine I read this article today on the NYT that said that having good quality sex over good quantity sex can bring you happiness equivalent to having an extra $, So Thats why I was wondering how you feel Also there was this study where couples doubled the number of times they had sex ( time a week becomes  times a week, etc.) and they actually because less happy I do enjoy having sex with you but it is SOOOO much better when we are alone like in the car That's why I limit myself to one item at fast food pla c ate ths e coronet they have drink menus lol I feel like forcing sex to happen when one party isn't peachy keen on it usually ends up worse and creates resent Is that strange? House alone > car > not al o I njuse t fell asleep inside McDonald's What do you consider our recent sex times? There were times I felt were acceptable to leave because everyone is asleep but you get tired so fast hahah I wanted to do the bathroom sink And then all day I wanted to do that Ummmm where have you been with a drink menu? I remember when Larissa was very into fashion and she considered going to FIDM What's a fashion degree from Williams worth? What happens if you miss a day of taking T 
 Lol williams is so above offering fashion degrees I take it weekly But sometimes I'm a day or two late. Nothing happens. I sometimes take it early the next week so it stays on the same day of the week Just this week I went to el charro They have a drink menu Lots of sit down restaurants do How did you fall asl e Loel wp ell Reyna was the one who texted me and told me they gave her a separate drink menu. I assume it wasn't only alcohol but juices and teas and stuff. I know many restaurants do but they are usually for alcohol  But what if you were to stop taking it altogether or if you skipped a week or two I was actually just sitting at a table in the play area and then I put my head down and fell asleep. Sunday, June   Pl,s r  ead http//mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/opinionator////singleminded/?referrer= I'll read yours right now Then I'm probably gonna fall asleep 😕 You know, you actually don't have to read the opinion piece if you don't want to. Some of them aren't interesting but I read them because of the different perspective. How do you really feel about sending me nudes and vice versa  To some people it is incomprehensible.( )/a tta  chment.JPG One lesbian relationship that is actually super cute Or just female female Oh, a separate non-alcoholic drink menu That's more uncommon I really don't mind it They cute And Isabella looks stoned or she just cried I just looked at some of the library resources I have access to through brown And it is ridiculous Any academic anything I want NYT subscription Soviet film magazine archives... It just goes on and on. Literally anything you can think of and m o Shre ge ot those Colombian cocaine connections That is seriously so unfair. What do we get at the UA? Does it depend on what your major is or are these resources available to all Brown students? Honestly wtf Maybe you could send some interesting things, please God, they are literally preparing you for upper class life Alex mom, I'm black! Pretty sure most of these resources are present at all research universities  Maybe not the NYT But the major databases The soviet film shit is probably because they have a class in that It is available to all brown students I'm working on something right now but I'll read your stuff in a  f htetp/w /mobile.nytimes.com////opinion/sunday/welcome-everyone-to-the-right-to-marry.html?referrer=&_r= http//mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/well////the-joy-of-just-the-right-amount-of-sex/ Ok read these two and ignore the other one. It's like when I recommended bachelorette. Don't waste your time. What are you up to? The first also gives background to why the Supreme Court case came up, which you asked today but neither Reyna nor I knew “There is something wonderful about being part of an oppressed community,” As fucked up as that sounds I actually understand where he is coming from I am about to play with photoshop Oh I was actually asking about AZ but thanks And I agree, I think that way too I don't want to be expected to be married and settled at  with a white picket fence and  k i Thderes
 was something special about having a forbidden love. About nobody in my family knowing about my sexual orientation or my lovers. About having boyfriends and feeling risky to show affection because of the world we live in. It's nauseating how much support [straight] people have been giving the LGBTQ community. Like I really had a different experience, intensified by the religious upbringing I wouldn't go that far buddy That it is nauseati n Itg ju? st seems too sudden It is definitely great and all but I mean it is not like I need it or something  I can't explain why it bothers me I went through my photoshop obsession in th grade hahah I feel like being gay means my life has no expectations There's a different attitude about having kids and all sorts of things that straight people are expected to do because the mechanics and the society work together with them. *for them Yo, you asleep? Also I finally learned what code switching is https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=JzprLDmdRlc Well goodnight then H I ionc! e went  days without shitting during camp bc of the KYBOs (camp bathrooms) But hey hey hey LOL THE VIDEO Reyna and I saw a Lamborghini yesterday ( )/a tta  chment.jpeg And I looked it up. $K. The second article is sweet I feel that the NYT has a way of expanding on the feelings we all experience, laying out the logic of it all and making it a sto r Ity's . funny to me how for some people the label 'religious' means good character and ethics whereas for us it's lunatics  What kind of rich person would get a Lamborghini with camo print............. ????????????????????????????  The second article about sex? Lol I thought the marriage one was the sweetest Oh sorry I meant the marriage one Idk he was old and white Maybe actually li k I'eve   been thinking about that too, about the NYT. Their logic is so consistent and the stories are so personal and relevant that it impacts me more than other things I read.( )/a tta  chment.JPG This whole anti-white sentiment actually bothers me ;( it's so counterproductive  I thought the part where the author was like every day, for every one thing I get annoyed with my husband about there are  things that make me feel lucky to be married to him/in love  That was so cute  That also probably explains it. White men and their hunting. 
Those articles make me get all pensive and reflective about my life and my struggles and my relationships. It's not even after the article, but there are so many easy to read, yet complex one-liners every so often that make me stop and think. Like after reading those articles last night I wrote a little journal entry about my experiences because of the articles Priscilla's boyfriend( )/a tta  chment.JPG What the duck Fuck FUCK FUCK Is that perhaps just a flattering photo Because otherwise How did she do t h Hea sat id he fell in love with her the moment he saw her And he was clingy at first and really touchy and she told him she wasn't interested and that he needs to be himself Then once he was they started dating Pretty sure it is camo to denote military servi c Shee s  aid he's literally hotter than me ^ Ya W Heo wow rks for a delivery service so he gets to work out his muscles  It's not that Priscilla is unattractive. She is just short Jay is into that She is average In face and b o Yodu ky now, I just looked through her pics and I think she is pretty attractive  Her personality is also really fun Yeah I thought it was probably a Jay thing too His family owns the UFC and he used to be a professional boxer, but he started smoking weed and got super lazy  The guy literally has everything Wtf Is he like dumb or something Not to date her, but just in gene r Praiscl illa got him off of weed and now he's back to working out twice a day and boxing It was funny the way she said it Like she helped him overcome this addiction I'm glad I stopped smoking too. Nobody likes to be around people who are sad all the time. He doesn't go to college 
I read this article on NPR and someone was like I love kids with troubled backgrounds. They are more interesting than kids who have everything because they have a different perspective on the world and they are strong willed and passionate And they have a lot of emotion too Is he from here?? I agree. I don't even really like smoking It's not social for   I mthie nk he is Yup When are you heading  o A ulitt tle after  But mentally I don't know when I'm going to head out that's usually when I lose service What are you even doing today You seem busy Because I'm older I don't have to do all the activities the younger kids have to do which means more free time ) So what do you do all  d Draaw,y

 was annoyed bc you didn't even say anything all week or when I was leaving and stuff but it's kinda ridiculous  I had a great time Yesterday was the only day out of the week I got upset because all the kids were acting rambunctious   Sorry? I spaced when you were leaving and considered it useless to text when you were gone because you wouldn't get it Were you in cha r Cagn Je en come tonight?

Why don't we go see firewor k Beslla?
 got a vibrator.... It was shipped to Raad's house there's a pool up on the mountain and yes, it was  degrees every day in the water ( We had to do body carries and rescues in the water Okay fine I'm sorry I'm being such a bitch. I actually have a lot to say about camp I actually wrote down stuff every day to tell you Shall I tell you tonight or right now? We can do that, but aren't you having people over? Imagine Campbell fireworks! When do you want to meet up tonight? Campbell would be great We haven't established any plans Literally what you have seen of the conversation is the whole conversation Or we could see fireworks as a group You could start telling me now and continue later? Good for Bella? That's interesting I went swimming again and it was warm and nice Have you been harboring this upset attitude all week You didn't respond to me in the chat It was all really pe t Catmpby ell might be packed actually Okay kinda but I really missed everyone and it pissed me off I don't think I was being super unreasonable Even Diviya agreed with me I missed you a lot  t I owaso
 a little hurt that you didn't say anything and you were terse but I am over it Unhappiness is a state of mind P That is voluntary Ok let's move   I owasn
 also thinking swimming tonight, maybe? Or s'mores? Or BOTH Too hot for s'mo r I eliks e the idea of a potluck. I'll make something. Some of the camp songs were so funny I have decided to say some of the lines during sex Also Ben's (ex-satanist) dad is surprisingly hot Ben cut his hair and he looks like a surfer dude from the 's or a French intellectual when his hair is combed back He had a crush on this  year old counselor who goes to Basis pro valley *oro Ben to me as I was yelling and moaning is that a gantrum?  *gay tantrum* Why did you say  You didn't even tell me a time I want to go out and see the fireworks before? What's one of the camp song lines? Is ben g a Oky so? rry sorry well then how did you think tonight would work Bengay is an ointment Why were you yelling and moan i I nhadg
 this terrible ointment after my circumcision. Whenever I hear the word ointment I think of that. You can bring something but I doubt others w i Hlavel
 you ever seen a penguin drinking tea? Take a look at me, a penguin you will see. That's how one song goes for  minutes. NOOOOOOO he is super straight. The counselor is female.  He is fascinated by homosexuality though. He asks so many questions. Two questions . What time at your place? . Fireworks as a group or no? Ok just one thing before I move on and get back on track You ignoring me doesn't solve things Doesn't make things better So even if you were right to be mildly upset, it isn't right to ignore me as a result I don't understand the penguin song Time at my place depends on when fireworks are. I think they are at  going as a group sounds fun I don't think it could start before  O Yoru'r  e right, but also I didn't understand why you would ignore me in our personal chats and then acknowledge me on the group chat. I was confused. The penguin song would have made more sense if I didn't tell you now and if you heard it  Hmmmm. Where would be a cool place for the group to go? Have you ever played gagaball? Jay's idea seems cool. How do you feel about that? Getting our own fireworks Gagaball? No? What's that Eh I mean it would supplement the real fireworks I guess we could see them from the park if we wanted Hey are you going to church Really want that   Camp ex emptions hahah And the stor iaenings

Have fun  Catn you brinhg 🌿 for to he party Like just for The friend group ,  Ok  nvm actua,lly I mea  n this in the most romantic way possible, please I absolutely love the way I smell after holding you and being inside of you Di nner this ❤week? I a️ lso want to see The Overnight Actually nvm I'm going to be busy this week All week? Wtf? Wolfpack! And yeah dinner sounds gr Weell tonighta I was goit ng to see the movie about the girl with cancer, and Earl and the Dying Girl Then tomorrow I have to go party shopping all day and then  night is the party for close friends Wolfpack looks soooo awesome. That was my second choice after overnight Okay, are you also in the mood for Indian? I want to try May's Counter Chicken & Waffles I hi I Hjust woke iup in the * movie theater  The movie isn't that great I'm probably going to walk to in n out What's up Hey I am just getting home Party shopping? Indian is Pa rty shoppigng, what? r Mays is also I' m just alogne lol r Like shopping for what for the pa Wer only needt food I thy ink Ugh it's raining now I can't leave lol How was your day today? This morning Diviya's mom took me home and I officially declare that being alone with people's parents is the weirdest thing ever It was raining with sun out at my house My day was pretty alright. Didn't really do anything all morning until a lab meeting, which was interesting.  How was it What did she  Yesah I know aI'm at they
 in n out right next to your house It was like a  second rain Well she told me she could see me in either Boston or New York and she was telling me about all the things to do there and what it was like for her growing up near NY It was fine but awkward without Diviya to provide comfort Did you know that I saw and heard Diviya and Nate having sex almost all night Then when I asked Diviya about it she said they were doing things from the moment lights went off to am I'm at the family friend's house haha So we switched places  Wow I feel less bad about us now Good for them I had an amazing time last night Seriously it was like the best ever for me I had been dreaming of it all afternoon and evening and it exceeded my fantasies  AKA you probably noticed how wet I  I wthought yoau were upss et with me last night because you eventually told me to stop I'm now at Starbucks working on my common app Also Diviya told me not to repeat this but I think I have the right to? Last night she told me that you think I get rapey with you sometimes What do you mean by that I wasn't upset, I just thought it was too loud and I didn't want to upset Diviya I think it is frustrating when you get drunk and if I don't have sex with you you tend to get very upset Which is pretty manipulative But I am also not very upset by If  we had swiitched sidt es I could have kept going and I wouldn't have had to see shirtless Nate thrusting it into Diviya I'm surprised you didn't catch any of her moaning  Or when she got up to check the condom I don't think it's the sex part, necessarily  It's more that I just want to be alone with you at some point of the night like every other couple is, and that usually entails sex I don't believe it has to though and I don't always want it to I push for alone time early because you are one of the only people who falls asleep early  It's just weird to me, sleeping together with other people in the same bed Sorry I'm driving I will answer in a drc Sec Didn't want to leave you hanging That's awkw Thaat's alrigrht. Right d now I'm having Larissa, KZ, Diviya, Martha, and Nate help with my common app lol I sleep heavily  I suppose Omg sergio stop Let it go Wait til the school year Ok but even if so the way you conduct yourself isn't appropri Soa obviouslyt it's aboue t being gay and my coming out experience and Keizer's response was I liked it. It pulled on my heartstrings I see your motivations but the ends don't justify the means Oh ok so it's just the first essay Still  Waittttt y'all need Jesus to help you cool it P ,  Ok ay well th,en I'll co  ol it at this next party  No! I need mine to be as brilliant as yours I want to do it with you usually I just don't want to worry about the consequences if I say no, I want to do it because we both want to?  Mine took  drafts I started  weeks into school with one paragraph One sucky paragraph It'll be f I ican send int to you te hough, ya? But wouldn't you want to do it in another room rather than having me stick it in while we are presumably asleep I don't want mine to take forever though It will And when you think it is done It won't I  want to gebt it over e with ASAP and just worry about taking my SAT one more time and schoolwork Schoolwork is almost nothing as a senior  SAT will be over soon enough Your only real work is essays So don't buy into the bullshit that you shouldn't have a summer  I know you feel unproductive As compared to them But this isn't a good means to express t Ath least thea manager ot f panera is scheduled to call me tomorrow I actually feel the opposite of the first statement. I'm going to be taking connolly's critical theory and AP research  That's a lot of fucking writing The writing just happened on its own today It's not the writ I iwas writinng a poem ag nd then I started writing about common app worthy stuff and BAM! It's having other people review it The refining I think that's where it is overboard No  Seriously trust me They do everything to hold your hand and hand you an A Literally they are told to No matter the class (except Ms. k) But anyway Thank you for last night again, I felt soooo good but I'm sorry for being a d Idik why you'cre being ak
 hard ass about this. I'm having fun being this open with people and letting them read it. Keizer says he isn't ready to speak about his sexuality in the form of an essay yet but he was touched and that made me so happy How were you being a dick? You were so quiet last night. I felt like it was either silent judgement or you were kinda high What made me happiest about the entire time was when we intertwined hands during the amazing sex and saying goodbye before you finally left So not the sex itself but the romantic gestures I thought it was going to be but anyway Goodnight bitch Omg Keizer is apologizing to me because he can't write about his sexuality It's funny how we are expected to show this very vulnerable side of ourselves to our college counselor and some stranger across the country  Idk you thought I didn't want it I didn't mean to give that impression  Very kinda 🌿 Lol I know right I derive some comfort in the idea I don't know the admissions officer and never will  Some people meet theirs, I think it's kinda icky  But anyway Goodnight bi I thonestly dcid not exph ect you to come last night Diviya and I were talking about how we missed Nate and then she said he was on his way Seeing you was a surprise You're terrible Absolutely terrible ☺️🐢🍆❤️👬 Goodnight Are you going to make lemon bars today or tomorrow? I c ??a Your nfirst sent? ence in your essay is grammatical incorrect Your use of different tenses is inappropriate And yes I'll make lemon b Whay are you rreading its
 now oh my god It's awful I am on lunch break And you sent it to me Announced her stay needs to be rephrased It has the wrong connotations  I am very critical with essays, lol Ok also and this is a bigger th Anithony likend it but hg e said I sound very condescending And like a racist It makes a bad impression to say you didn't give a shit about your mom. Say you were conflicted. Something. Not apathetic. Even if you are about to go into it, saying you don't care if someone dies is never good Colleges will rate your personality based on essays Like literally numerically rate She isn't even catholic Ok anyway sometime we should talk about your essay in per Shse was raisoed a cathon lic. Converted in her s When it's a more complete draft Cos I'm gonna be too picky for it to be useful at this point How is your  ( d Okay It aalready huy rt and you weren't even far You've also never read any of my writing before, I think My day is alright. Went out to Goodness for breakfast this morning and then went party shopping Wbu? Sorr Hayhah it's f ine it act( ually wasn't that mean I just got my uncle to buy us alcohol Are you able to store? Yeah What's Ac tually Veruis and I ap re meeting my uncle tomorrow lol I just finished cooking and working out party stuff with people. I need to get Diviya a present and get some money. Wbu? How are you feeling? I'm feeling pretty good, just headed home When are we headed out tomorrow Or when In general And also what are you buying What drinks what quantit Doi you have eany drinkss
 at your place Like / bottle of rum So not rea Relyna and Alle are shary ing a tent and he is bringing her up Maybe we can use that up on  night? So we are heading up the mountain on  afternoon but Diviya and I are thinking of a small sleepover on ? Idk. I am giving my uncle $-$ and he's just gonna get mike's, beer, vodka, etc. Actually Diviya and I want to know if we can smoke O Aight And I don't have much but sure but When are you planning to smoke Because I want to be at whatever events we have, but I think it creates negative energy when we are together and smoking So maybe if you do it some morning and I go hike, or after I fall asleep or someth Wei as in youn and me? g I smoked at Joseph's...? Oh! I lied. I gave it up after Joseph's. Not prom. I was totally fine that night. That party was my favorite. But whatever you want, idc Or I could drive you up and you smoke before that drive We  wanted tou do it tomp orrow night Nvm just forget it What are your thoug Yohu're makintg this a bs igger deal than it has to be. Diviya and Nate and I could come over tomorrow night and just do it in the shower and it's not a problem. It is a problem though I don't want it done at my house... How did sleepover become sleepover at my hou Whsy is it a eproblem Y? our house is a suggestion, I didn't say it had to be Maybe you can drop it off at Diviya's Tomorrow night I'll think about it()/a ttachment. j Nop, fo  rget aebout it. Ig t's not happening. Do gay couples with a trans person actually do that? I knew the first man to get pregnant thing was a huge deal Idk why trans people never bothered me, even with my upbringing Probably because All my life I felt like everything the church said about sexuality was wrong, and that extended to gender too? Idk Anyway, I'm sorry if I upset you Bass lesson tonight? Sometimes they do He wasn't at all the first He just drew a lot of publicity to himself Idk it seemed like they did bother you? No I was just showering And sorry, honestly my logic was that I'm ok with giving it to you to do, but not if as a result I won't join you guys the sleepov htetps//www.fracebook.co  m/uniladmag/videos// Do you want me to jack off tonight or no was I ever transphobic to you? What did I say? I mean I guess the concept was foreign but the actuality of it made it clear What are you doing tonight Or tomorrow night Don't jack Tonight I am chillin at home bc I am tired but we could hang out if you want You didn't say anything but I thought you indicated that you used to be transphobic I love the video L JeOn and JoseVph aren't E coming btw Nvm, I figured you would be tired this week so I went out anyway haha While I was driving I had this crazy energy exchange with some guy next to me and we kept looking away and glancing I swear it was Rosinbum Or maybe I'm missing him so much that I'm projecting his face onto other people It had to be him I literally did not know what transgender was until I met you, and when Shawn said that thing I was hurt I got Curt to come camping with us hahah The West Bank snapchat story was surprising()/a ttachment. jpg I wan  t to make this picture the party cover for Facebook Yes do it Love your use of energy exchange@ I hate that snapchat felt obligated to do West Bank the day after Israel. That's political. (  Omg city Cu I rmight go tto all the * SOS shows Yeah I felt the same way about it. Snapchat got a lot of shit for only doing Israel though. Why ( ? And why is Curt an omg? Maybe him and Leo can finally get their sexual frustrations resolved  I think the next time you reply you're going to be going to sleep The night we were at Diviya's I obviously didn't want to get blue balls so I jerked off on my own and I came all over my chest It was a bunch   They are in  weeks? ?

Her mom is upset about housing it and Nate doesn't want to take it. I ate a burger, chicken salad, chips, and drank some tea. Doing some laundry now and unpacking. Wbu?

How did we not figure this out sooner Idk ( that is soooo upsetting Nate didn't want to take it He literally could have taken it and called you to see if he could drop it off I turned some dollar box of pasta roni into gourmet shit with chili powder and vegetables Why don't you like her post...? It's so touching. Show her that you, as a gay, love her too. We thought Thurman ova there havin' a seizure, turns out he just excited about nature. -GhettoHikes This sounds like Nate more than her mom than... Maybe I'll like it! ) I got some gourmet pasta from the freezer Thx Amy's Like ghetto hik I edon't undesrstand y'a? ll's fear of carrying substances. I'd rather be caught carrying alcohol than weed. Also what is the chance of getting pulled over and the cop seeing it I'm not going to place it on my passenger seat When I drive you bet I'm going to be storing So afraid and costing us $ of liquor smh. WHO THROWS IT AWAY Check your privilege At least I understand the work necessary to make the gourmet meal The blood, sweat, and tears How it feels to plant the tomato seed in the ground to make your pasta sauce It's like that ghetto girl from Grand Canyon  Ghetto hikes is some funny shit And by I, I mostly mean my ancestors... Or my cousins and uncles and aunts and grandparents  What have you been up to tonight Oh my god more policeeeeeeeee My dad does the tomato part So actually I'm closer to the struggle Why police again I have been watching house of cards, long bath Shaved the whole abdomen It's all smooth n shit I guess nothing could happen with the cops You are right Bringing it into my house with all the sloshing noise is another sto Yoru need to yopen the s  nap Lol your dad just interacts with thexicans. He doesn't actually grow himself unless you count your domestic garden Police over some stupid glasses and ex-dad's girlfriend cussing grandpa out and whatever Being home is very stressful I don't understand the feeling when people say that school is the most stressful part of their lives I was going to ask for a pic but I can wait P Also Richie steals clothes from my closet and then wears them to his dad's house and I never see them again Exactly. I will probably store mine in the attic. Right now Alex and I are home alone while grandpa and mom are over at ex-dad's house to handle police, as members of both parties curse and scream at each other Omg ew God I didn't know kids could have moobs that young  Is he gonna get diabetes He used to grow? Are they nice clothes The act of going to school is never stressful for me It's the knowledge that going to school may entail more work at home You never know when an assignment from hell is headed your  Thwe doctor ias worried y Richie will get diabetes and I'm sure Alex is next. Portion control and calories are foreign practices in my family.  *regulating calorie intake I mean that your dad doesn't grow the tomatoes, unless you count him tending the garden at your place Regardless, the clothes are clothes and they are my clothes, but yes. He takes nice clothes that I regularly wear and it pisses me off. I find peace in working on assignments because it gives me an excuse to detach myself from the situation at home I need places to go and things to do and people to talk to so I am distracted from my family, so I don't drown here ,  Th us, I star,ted readin  g Gone Girl about  minutes ago ) But I am saying he did grow tomatoes, like legit grow them For years in Israel ( That's so sad Is the book any good Tell him no girls like fatties Except some fat girls Anyway good ni Gogodnighth YoSoo t I am euating quinp oa with tomatoes and onions and bell peppers and some meatless chicken strips (?).

 serving of the Ancient Harvest inca red quinoa. Boil it in a small pot of water and add onions, yellow and red bell peppers, and tomatoes. On a skillet I fried some little veggie chicken strips, but obviously you can add whatever else you want. It's basic. I also had some edamame on the side That's terrible!

Hopefully you can complete it successfully 😊 I think a  is kinda low. He says that I'm cute more than anything, which I kinda agree with. I'm supposed to go swimming tonight but the weather decided to foil my plans Also sorry, I just got back from a walk so I couldn't reply How does that end up tasting like chocolate I had to set up these plates of DNA for the sequencer But you can't tell if they are full And they are very large grids so it gets confusing and headache-y In what context did Keizer say that ( I wish you could swim.  Who were you gonna go with Lol I ran into Keizer at the hospital and he totally ignored me. I was like Hey! And he was like hi...... And turned a I whave you taell you a y secret Also hi bb boy, just woke up from a nap 
During the camping trip, after the group split up and stopped playing truth or dare, KZ and curt went back to the tent and talked for a while.

How was your day? 
My day was ok, I didn't do much, and one in the girls in the lab got on my nerves because she has the same conversation and same question with everyone all the time and she keeps asking if she should go to GCU and they all say no and yet she hasn't gotten the hint. It's like she won't stop until some fool says yes. /rant What are you going to order to eat Nvm Do you wanna get dinner now I want real food Or go to Bookman's or something I need to get Diviya's gift since she is coming today Answer b Hi isorry just sgot out of h shower Well my family is doing cake now (ughhh) and right after I'm doing black crown.

Why can't she just make the decision on her own Like figure out what she wants. She doesn't need to consult every random person she meets.

Ummmmm? I consider myself versed enough That.'s awesome! .That sounds . like the biggest nostalgia score right there. None of us grew up reading Little House... Honestly reading it  I hanted reading othe biblew It is clear that I liked it because I liked to live vicariously and know the practical ins and outs of people's lives in other places and ti Basimcally read Reevelations as nd you'll be scared for life Beyond that it's a simplistic book Maybe a bit of a thesis on american culture That's what Christy said!

And yes congratulations What did the application invo Tradler Joes! It'vs already ovee r? What did you guys eat 
I submitted the application a while ago. There was some logic and math quiz lol. When I showed up to donate clothes I asked about my application and two people talked to me for a while and they set me up for an interview. What are you up to now Mom's having me drive alone right now lol Sometimes I want to look like this http//m.imgur.com/a/XTAsv The whole clearly male but makeup really appeals to me We are whatever. I mostly had gifs Figs The oldest kid (rising sophomore) talked about how flowing wells had a football game where they threw flour for school pride (idk) but someone laced it with ecstasy and a ton of people got high from inhalation lol Where you going I'm taking a bath. Prolly gonna read  Was the math hard http//m.imgur.com/a/VMKLu lol  I'vew always wantetd to work on f my eyebrows and eyelids with some bomb eyeliner or eyeshadow. I think I'll do that this week when I go visit Madeleine or maybe have Reyna help me. He looks great in the first pic Hahahahahahah what the fuck Oh my god That's the craziest shit I ever heard why am I not invited to these events I need to go to a flowing wells football game Also throwing flour is very normal. at the UA graduation the kids throw tortillas, hahah. I drove to a few fast food places to get stuff for the family but I didn't get anything Like for myself  The math was a bitch, but only because there are like  questions that you need to answer in  minutes. You don't need to answer them all but I got nervous. http//mobile.nytimes.com////world/asia/in-china-a-supercity-rises-around-beijing.html?_r= Crazy shit I wonder why that is considered necessary at sav UGHHeHHH I'm so prissed off Aims ee I'm sorry I ju st hate how i mmature my fa? mily is and how divorced parents act Like I wish you understood I always want to cry whenever they interact because I can't understand how two people can be so hostile towards each other Every interaction is destructive 
And like my grandpa went to dad's car (because he was picking Alex up) and asked for some bowl back that Alex accidentally left with and took to his dad's place, but then his dad said don't talk to me unless it's in court  I want to punch a wall Everyone is a fucking idiot It gets to you after a while It doesn't sound like something that should be irritating but it fucking is Where and when did this enmity origin It'sa been going otn between pare ents since th grade but between me and dad since th? Many years But this le Thisv level since eth What wl as it before th Befoere then he dindn't have a g? irlfriend lol but now she cusses my mom and grandpa out and he is always obligated to defend her because SO's are always right I'll read your Beijing article soon, sorry Lol I doubt companies even assess those personality tests or any test, for that matter Apparently there was a massive storm south of Shanghai and the Internet was down That's why Jenny couldn't talk to me I have to tell you about the people at savers when I see you and you need to tell me about Greece That sounds crazy! I feel like I vaguely might have heard about that... For sure. Any idea when? Are we going to that guy's house this week Sergio I feel wonderful I started a load of laundry that was much needed I found your sweatpants And put your other clothes in the washer I cleaned my room I messaged Sweeney as I have been putting off doing for weeks And I messaged Doug back And I opened all the snapchats And nothing is weighing on my mind No to-do list forever delayed Now all I have to do is read a few articles I have sa You vwaited that leong to wash td he vomit clothes... Lol. That's great!! Although it's strange to me that those things don't get done immediately. For me those are always priorities, except messaging people back. I do message important people back immediately though, so the Sweeney thing would have been a priority. I'm happy for you I would prefer doing dinner and going to his house tomorrow. 
 is cool too but then we couldn't see the sunset because I have to volunteer in the evening Madeleine says I was rude to her at Elliot's party and she's upset with me but I actually don't remember anything ( Yes she told me that I forgot to tell  Righyt now I'm reaoding Gone Giru l while watching Lifetime.

 didn't text me back and then I realized I didn't reply It's called GIF Keyboard  What's up Also I was very irritated and idk why So I'm gonna hang out with Reyna and will during the day and you'll meet up with us?

Hahaha ,  Do y ou think the ,female popula  tion limit in China will be annulled because of this new governmental ambition? Lol no I'm glad you feel better Tho It'su weird that wge are gonna mh eet will He's so boring He has the personality of an Adidas flip flop He asked us the questions I used to look up on the Internet If you had a million dollars what would you do? If you could change one thing about your life what would you do? Then it was awkward because we didn't ask him back You know, I used to feel guilty about saying things like that Is it bad if I don't? I have the personality of a sperry's topsider and you of a converse allstar Saying things like whatv Sorr y, I like to  think of myse? lf as a  Alexander McQueen bootie Judging him hardcore I've really been enjoying the last few days with you Minus you telling me to not drink because I get emotional Of all things that's what you pick out  Lol lof all shoes oor of all thil ngs to not enjoy? Or of all things to feel bad about doing? Gotta be direct The middle one Things not to enjoy I feel like we have disagreed on quite a few things, though I too had a great time. Surprising that that was the one you latched onto Though I can't specifically recall other recent tensi The odrinking thinng is the onlys
 thing I can think about? Oh the looking at Oscar's dick thing You were actually flirting Just too fucked up to remember I actually was not At  Lol a I'm joking lOk I only latl ched onto the drinking thing because it seriously pissed me off And I proved you wrong anyway You didn't prove me wrong...? Sorry I really don't want to upset you again We can just let it You  said I would gact all emotio onal and get crazy and whatever I literally didn't I didn't mean that time in specific I meant it was a general risk So no you didn't do it this last time but you haven't disproven the general fact that it happens sometimes Regardless I'm glad we both enjoyed the ni Okayg then I uhnderstand that t it is a difficult conversation for you Precisely because it is ongoing Something hard to prove wrongl What
 the fuck And I'll try
 to be less grating Why what the fu No ict's not. Therke are certain
 things that happen at certain parties that upset me, it's as simple as that. If I were sober at the parties where I get pissed off I can assure you I'd probably get pissed off sober And it's often triggered by external forces that you don't inform me of And you would probably tell me in a reasonable way And we would move on But you are drunk so you just get sad and withdrawn until it boils o No bvecause you aleways dismiss r my problems and say they don't exist I doubt being sober would fix anything You don't start crying and trying to drown at sober parti It meakes the partsy more fun, n  o? Idk Lwhat you're torying to do rl ight now Nvm I don't k now why this ? is such a difficult topic to have an open and honest discussion about But if ever that is on the table let me k It jnust feels likoe I can't addw ress some issues to you without having you discredit them I feel like you don't always take time to listen I feel the same way except that I feel that I am walking on pins and you can suddenly become upset and withdrawn Can we agree to set both these behaviors momentarily asi Set dthem aside foer what? F? inding a soluti Do yoou feel like nit's pointles  s to work on anything now On one hand yes On the other hand I would like it to be happy And us to go to parties without fear that I'll be a dick and you'll get upset Even for the short t Talkiing about thims stuff makese
 everything about us seem pointless Using those tenses In a larger sense everything is pointless But we work things out and do things and create anyway But if you think it is unnecessary and likely to be a negative experience I understand And anyway I am going to sleep, so goodnight, and I look forward to tomorr I doon't know whatw I want All . I know is how I feel about certain things and how I feel when things happen but I don't know what to do. It is like this endless cycle of feelings except I'm scared to share them because they're going to be invalidated  Which goes for everything in general And that our expiration date is too soon to feel anything real or to develop anything Fuck this You just need to tell me everything you think is wrong with me Whatever goodnight I feel very sad that you don't express things for fear of invalidat I feiel like if I otell you I'm n upset you're going to say it's not real and not understand where I'm coming from If I tell you I love you I think you don't believe me  I feel like emotions and feelings are very complex and form from varying forces that I am as of yet unfamiliar oth W Todaiy I cried butt I don't knowh
 why I can't think of the right thing to say now There's so much I feel like I should apologize Or ask what it means to say I care about you No you should Or tnell you that 'I will be bett ter Or to move on But I don't know I feel conflicted  I dot know that I olike you a loo t and I want us both to be happy Maybe we can talk about this type of thing over din I ennjoy the time eI spend with r you You are one of my favorite and most important and most influential people in my life I think it would be better in person Less disjoin Okayt I'm sorrye No no it's d fine I'm just very tired And I want to hear you out But I also want to respond meaningfu Do ylou want to dol dinner aloney

Why'd you think you upset me You opened my snap  But didn't respond to my text Phenol chloroform is literally the scariest shit (Chemical) The phenol burns/dissolves skin but it is also a local anaesthetic so you can't feel it happening And the chloroform increases phenol absorption in the skin (more burn) and causes cancer It can also damage the liver and kidneys, as well as reproductive damage Omg today Daniel came in asking if people say fabulous? remove the ? Because he watched this show called abfab (Absolutely fabulous) And they explained to him that it's associated with gay men And I think he laughed And then he referred to his husband, but just by his name, not as his husband. And only in front of me and the coworker lady. It was a gay day for Dani You ewanna hang and ltalk?

 a gets upset with ,Nate over saying s  hit, Nate gets upset with Diviya over saying shit, stop undermining and devaluing everything I feel and making me sound like some over emotional and symbolic bitch because your apathy overpowers everything I feel If I get upset over you joking about us not liking each other as intensely and then get over it, forget it I don't get why you have to get so pissed off with me for expressing some sort of emotion Sorry I can't be like you all the time I'll bet you actual $$ that if anyone said that to someone else in their relationship the other person would be upset too Or like other things I get upset about I feel like we probably just don't care anymore I feel like if I respond with my thoughts you'll say I'm devaluing yours, so I won I ser'iously won't I jutst want to also be.
 able to share emotional things without you saying I'm being irrational Please share though I can respect your emotions I might disagree but go on That's so bitchy ? Okay then Well Comparing to Nate and Diviya is terrible That's a horribly dysfunctional dynamic And Nate gets upset about legit things And Diviya doesn't For the most part But also Nate doesn Nate 'got upset because tDiviya wouldn't hu  g him goodbye Start randomly acting withdrawn without explanation  Start trying to kill himself at part ^not ibecause of you e Start crying rands omly at parties and be inconsolab And ilt was a joke Oen many occasi Is   thoat all? Basicanlly I don't have s a problem with emotional at all I have a problem that Your emotional comes out as a lack of communication So I can't even fix the problem because you won't tell me what's When  you say randomly yuou make me sound lp ike this all happens spontaneously and for no reason That's what upsets me And from my perspective it does Because you don't say shit to I fee l like you don't cmare anymore and ife
 I told you you would get upset with me You wouldn't believe that what I feel is something valid  Even if it is valid It does warrant that kind of reaction Again it's not the emotion It's the express Ok anid what was wrong woith my expression n today By telling you directly that what you said upset me And then getting over it Well I was upset at the kimchi thing Because you got all qu I tolid you I felt uncomefortable And tt hat on top of lingering thoughts Which is a fair thing to say  I madbe an effort to taluk to people But t at some point you withdrew And wouldn't even talk to me I get not starting conversations or engaging But I don't get why you get all quiet and awkward to me But anyway that's not important It was just the chain of eve No bunt it upsets you antd I don't want yous
 to be upset with me I wish things were like   Where we made everything work You know and the other th But liike you famously snay, it's almost ovg er You are throwing this at me now for saying it But you have said it over and over ag Okay ayes but I say it biy admiring it n
 was so great implying over and over that it isn't like that  Not nwhen we used to reoally like each othw er There's a difference And then I'm the Villain for poking fun at what you always  I says it was a great tiame and I tell you y night after night that I had a great time with you You literally compared the emotions we have now to then If you said you had fun in  that's fine You would have still been upset I am % s You buring up events we rhad fun at in the e past all the time I don't get upset, % sure But not like that like I miss , we had such great times You would have been up Ok bust like I said, I setill tell you thatt
 I have great times with you whenever I see you I don't say when we used to like each other That gives bad connotations I have a meeting tomorrow so I would rather not drag this out discussing the details. Suffice to say, I'm sorry for what I said, but I hope you consider deeply what I have expressed now. So good night and if you want to we can continue this discussion tomor Ya worw ok I didnt alreaody listen to you aw sk me to not drink because you think I would get crazy at the last two parties when I literally didn't act like that at all Bc I haven't been better in any sense, as of tonight But yeah, I guess I just don't listen o you Bc that's what you feel Good night. Okay actually it's wrong to go to sleep upset And angry 
I'm sorry. Like I've been better at previous parties I want to be better all the time and this is something I'm committed to. I will work on social things but of course I don't want to ignore you and I want to have a good time just as much as you do. I hope you acknowledge my apology and I want you to know I seriously mean it. I wouldn't make an effort to change anything for you and for myself if I didn't care. 💖 you are one of the greatest things in my life and I hope you have a goodnight, minus bitchiness from earlier, Nature Boy 🌿 ❤️ Hey I got out early today what's Hey y a boy I was thinkiung of going to thep
 gym today What's up with you? Well I'm panicking a  Why??b?

Yes So I'~ m going to the library now I'm printing it out And that's only the non optional read Lol biring lots of quartners Lol I'm prg inting at h Ohhh oyou're going to remad at the library.e   I really need to start analyzing the literature regarding visual learn I assiume you're going tno read more than tg he optional To have a report next Fri *manddatory Probablya need at least  pay ges of writing, which means a shitton of reading because I don't know shit about the topic What's the fake ID decision coming down Awww  I'm at the park ritght now and there o is a mailman who parked in the shade and he is sitting at a table and thinking and just resting Idk it's really cute So does a report mean you need to just analyze it and the credibility or you need to read it and formulate your own opinion or....? Like what could you possibly add to his research Well  today I read an arNticle on Vice abouo t how being  doesn't mean jackshit anymore since kids these days have access to everything It means I need to summarize the literat So I ucame to the conclursion that I won't e Lol link article? Analyze all the literature on the topic Present what is most compell It's inot all about thatn but it was a partg
 from what I gathered from it http//m.noisey.vice.com/en_au/blog/im-terrified-of-teenagers So you're going to read all the stuff over the weekend and your report is due ? What are you doing the rest of the weekdays? No ok  The reading is for the historian coming  The report is for the more general project, and I need significant updates every Fri Ahh adnd what is the reaading topic for they
 leading historian? How are you going to assist him? He is coming in to Analyze the records of this collaboration between NASA and the Tohono O'odam tribe in the 's And so I am reading a summary of that endeavor A really fucking long summary In order to be of use to him Basically with the other work I'm doing the legwork for the doctor so he can get to research Hey siorry I was workingn out On my home rg ight now Cool, what was the collaboration? Is there an internet link or something? How is it related to medicine? I'm worried about working during the school year / idk how I'm going to get enough sleep and do hw No, they aren't public records, I got it on a USB drive of a scanned old text from . I can check but I don't think it's available online. No wiki article. Oh I'll just explain it I misread your text Basically there were remote people without access to healthcare, so that was a problem. Also NASA wanted to work on its technology to treat health problems that arise on space flights.  So They spent all this money setting up this technology so that these remote small clinics and a special van could video conference with doctors So that the remote people could get treatment In  There won't be as much HW! But yeah it will probably take out from your free time and social time By a  Ahhh lI see the NASA cononection. Providingt
 healthcare when it is scarce. Was this conducted on the reservation prior to the reservation attaining better  healthcare? When you say remote peoples are you referring to the natives 
Ahhh I see the NASA connection. Providing healthcare when it is scarce. Was this conducted on the reservation prior to the reservation attaining better healthcare? When you say remote peoples are you referring to the natives Yeah I told them I could close on some nights until /... I'll probably talk to them once I get my schedule and see how I can handle everything Didn't you want to start working to have some pocket money? I thought that was your plan I convinced Bella and Reyna to apply to savers with me I love the feeling after working out when I get to relax, watch a movie, and eat some trader joes frozen meal I wish you would come with me hahah What do you mean prior to attaining better healthcare? And yes, natives I did want to work but This opportunity I can't pass up, more worth it than an $ an hour job I do too Maybe we can have a work date? Get some chill food and coffee Work And then do something fun I am / as of now So I'm making good progress but The parts I have read so far have had a good number of photos, more than the rest of the t I asseume the reservatioxn now has decent ht ospitals I'm not entirely educated on that so don't hurt me They had decent hospitals then  Hahahtah lucky you. Let'os hope more of theo
 book is like that The issue is that it's a big area With small populati Yeah owe can do somethinng. I'm not doing as nything right now except for tumblr and the girl with the dragon tattoo So many people are far from healthcare, and they, at least back then, may not have had cars, etc. It would be a day-long trek to get to and from a clinic I'm actually near you  Oh yonu're at that libraory?

The kids ditch church services and talk about controversial liberal stuff. Not even kidding. Whatever event I go to I try to find the deviants. Think church camp and how I found girls to talk about anal with. I'm home alone for the next . hours lol What happens if they find out someone is an atheist Deviants can be fun or annoying. If it's the deviants of the liberal group, they suck. The deviants of a conservative group can be variable but often good. That's cool, I know what you are implying and I like it but I am reading Was that bitc Slighhtly ya but I felt bayd for distracting yo? u Like not bc of what you said ( Unintended Don't worry, if I felt distracted I would just put the phone d If thoe adults or staff mewmbers find out a scon ut is an atheist then you're asked to leave and you actually can't be in the scouting program Funny though because they accept Buddhists and Hindus...  Idk about Muslims. I remember a camp where one kid said a breakfast prayer in Spanish and there was huge outrage among scouts and parents because nobody could understand and this is America Deviants of the liberal group - Josh, who sucks, lol. I hate sex at the sex ed video The deviants of conservative groups are pretty fun. It's nice to hear about something besides guns, cars, and Dubstep when I'm at camp.  I think I'm going to go back to B&N today. I had too much fun. Maybe tonight with me? I'm on the last  pages  Lol nGot distracted, sorroy Definitely!

The neews is blaring and m  y mom is yelling lines from children's books Anyway, I'm excited California decided to open desalination plants. The arguments against it are pretty weak except for the technological malfunctions or and end to the drought *or an Thanks New Yorker! ) Why yelling? It's expensive tho... That's the real prob I've lstarted to pick up oen her accent. You km
now, paying more money for local services that will eventually level out is pretty damn worth it to me. It only consumes % more energy than taking water from other areas and it will raise the water bill for Californians about $ more. Its pretty negligible for the citizens That's true. On the system though it's a large cost And the higher cost to farmers = more expensive food  Sorry , I was reading Love, 🌚 Sorry b Swee ney kept me up But  real Hahah ah get some sleep and I hope everything goes
 well for you tomorrow🌚 Madeleine might consider spironolactone, it's an anti-androgen I wonder if she has had androgen levels tested? Or if the PCOS has not induced problematically high tesosterone levels She seems to not have the secondary sex implications of hig http/h/poutyprincesa.tumblr. com/post//weloveshortvT ideos-when-the-party-youre-at-is So I told her that and She says she's never been tested and she only has symptoms of PCOS, but the thing is that when she gets an ultrasound there were no cysts or thickening of the uterine wall. Nobody can explain it. http//godshaves.us/post/ What sympto Wellmlllll I get the weights gain, obviously, exce? ss hair, few/no periods, sleep apnea, ugly-ass stretch marks, and my fertility's never been tested lol so idk. And I have slightly increased T and T levels Well if she doesn't have cysts it isn't PCOS She k.nows that, but because. she expresses the sym. ptoms her doctor treats it like it is. That's kinda silly though That's a poor doctor I would  Ya bust what can a single teaacher mom with three ky ids afford Anyway How was your first day with the famous historian? They have insurance What'.s up with you I di.dn't interact with him.
 much, he is a quiet guy. And he was just reading all day But I had a cool day What about you? I am working on my various applications for things at brown That'Ss pretty funny haha. Nuot what I expected at p all. what did your day consist of then since you weren't much help to the historian?  I went to the gym today and the moment I did my warmup run I felt nauseous. Still, I persisted through it for around  minutes and went on with my workout, but I felt sick the entire time. I've been reading and drinking tea all day because I feel slightly shitty. Oh cool, what are some of the applications for besides that one newspaper you want  positions for hahah Also almost nobody fun is going to Jay's thing tomorrow. Diviya and Nate and Jennifer and Martha will be out of town. Reyna doesn't want to go. Madeleine is only going for an hour. I spent all day reading papers. There's no clear focus for the project yet so I felt pretty lost but the doctor gave me the best pep talk ever ( I really hope you aren't getting what I have. That's how it was Just that and phage hunters right now. Yeah I don't think I'm gonna go Haha .what was the much need ed pep talk about? I (
hope I'm not either ( I can tell that whatever I have is in the beginning stage of what is yet to come, though. I'm still going to the party because I bought food for it and it'll be interesting to see the (now) juniors get fucked up. I hope you had a great day 😊 I might ask to take the car to Jay's so I can leave whenever I want the next morning. Maybe hike sabino canyon at  or something. Oh!!!! I get my license tomorrow It was just like a don't worry I don't expect you to be PhD worthy within days. No stress Tell me how it goes! I might join you for the hike actually That would be fun. I could meet you there at  Congrats!!! Don't fuck it  ...wuithin days, rather witphin hours. Get to work  , bitch!!! Hahahahah Okay b 😘 He is a super optimist He's thinks things will just always work out And I appreciate that He's actually super not elitist He doesn't think he is the bomb and he really likes other people and doesn't jud Well gI don't know him. All eof my assumptions were 
 purely based on what I've heard haha and all the pressure he placed on you, but I'm glad he met and exceeded your expectations. That is really great. I'm glad that you have this opportunity and you're enjoying it. What were some things you talked about that made you realize these things? Are you still stationed in the hospital or?   Well he was very humble to the historian but he also talked about the scientific process and how his life goes and just a lot Kinda Same building but not the hospital proper To be fair the lab I was in before was officially the college of medicine So in the same capacity as I was in the hospital before,  Now myy mom knows about me aend 🌿 But s he wass n't upset Wh y I tolWd her I don?

Last night jay and I were sitting on the floor in his parent's bathroom while playing with the dog, and I said I love it when dogs lick me because I feel loved. Then jay said, the dogs can lick our faces and then we can kiss each other and we technically wouldn't be kissing since the dog's saliva is on us Also this black guy from Tucson high came and he kept hitting on me. Booby invited all of these Tucson high guys and Sadie invited her TH girls We played beer pong and danced a bunch together. Another gay guy joined us for twerking to gasolina  I watched over Jose as he threw up and he fell asleep in the shower ( Had to hold his hair and hands back 
I failed my other babysitting duties because Nina had to go out and console Ivan (who was upset and taking a walk outside) and she told me to watch Yulitza, the friend in the pic, when I got distracted and when I tried to look for her she was off fucking Abi's ex *Ulitza Where are you going?

Last night keagan took a video of me doing/saying something funny and then Wyatt said if I liked being filmed that his sister is looking for inspiration for a new piece, and I said I'm famous for my inspirational pussy pop and Keagan got really really uncomfortable and stopped filming me 
This morning I stayed with jay and Joseph and Elizabeth, but it got awkward once Joseph left bc jay and Liz were fighting and then when things settled down he put his hand up the front of her shirt in front of me, while talking to me Turns out Fatboys Laydee is my cousin on my mom's side... Lol  @ Keegan How did you find out about fat boys  Keagan* Why were they fighting  Yeah probably wo The guyu posted a video of Abi sittling on the toilet on her std ory.. How did Abi go to basis She messaged me directly lol and she was all excited but I'm scared to open the message. 
Jay left pretty late last night to go get coke (??? And Ulitza and her hookup wanted some and they were like, yes please! I need something to wake me up) and jay's mom got upset bc Jay wasn't responding and she kept yelling at Elizabeth and saying she holds Liz equally responsible. Liz got upset and doesn't want him to keep doing stupid shit like this. Jay thinks she's unreasonable. Jay's mom threatened to call the cops Did you get to sleep at a reasonable time? Also how is the family friend doing? Sometimes hanging around ghetto people is so much fun Ulitza told me about her fights with other guys and girls to protect her gay older brother I wish you were there, it would have been a lot of fun. I could have waken up to something nicer than Nina jumping on the bed, hahah. Oh that actually sounds scary Did ulitza do it Lol link? Did you open the message? I need ghetto in my life I wish I was there too. That said, I totally wouldn't have been decent at work today if I had stayed But it sounds so crazy Did you talk to keagan other than th Oh, anda Elliot pulled his dick outt on Diego Jay ended up chi? ckening out or something, I'm not sure. He didn't get it but the people who wanted it were kinda upset. It's on Abi's snapchat story lol. We were laughing about it in the morning but Jay was pissed bc they conspicuously flashed bottles of Malibu and vodka in his bathroom No haha I might never reply When I talk to ghetto people I turn really ghetto. Probably due to my upbringing and growing up with my family. I say shit the way they did in the thug porn video we watched Code switching I never thought I was capable of 
Yeah! It was the most keagan and I have ever talked. He's awesome. I almost drunkenly apologized for sharing that NPR article about trans hormones but then I realized that would be offensive and he probably didn't read it How was Charlotte doing?

The 
landlady's daughter wouldn't accept applications from married people, and the landlady would reject single people. So it was never rented. So the man went in alone, put in his deposit with the daughter, and then met this girl and had her pretend to be his wife to meet the landlady. So they got it.

After getting past the BS politics, the new Jim Crow is very compelling. I still don't appreciate the focus on extraordinary cases and lack of statistics, similar to the bullshit the media pulls, but basis is fair. I still don't think it's all explicitly or implicitly racially motivated, nor do I blame any specific politicians, but the war on drugs is so fucked up What's will you  succ me Are you a c No u For ryou to say the war on dp rugs iis not at least implicitly racp ially motivated is kinda ignorant... The fact that yesterday you assumed Abi's party withxicans would have hard drugs is a pretty strong example I think it's linked to a disdain for poverty Which is linked to race but I don't think race is part of the equation  WELL her ex-bf supported drugs at Jay's It was based on that If not for that I wouldn't have made that presumpt When askied to think of an average druog user, many people tend to tn hink of blacks and Latinos, regardless of clothing (which is usually the indicator of wealth and poverty) I think of a meth head, whi And whatt about marijuana? White feor sure I don't associate dr  ugs (except maybe crack) with minorit Bias pliays an important role in thise most Americans now think of s colored people when they are asked to imagine a drug user, which leads to discrimination in the criminal justice system consciously and unconsciously. Maybe it's not the case for you but it is for many other people They are real assumptions and stereotypes But a It's notl a fucking disdain for povertsy either, because In that caso e explain Wall Street to me Explain coachella or any other music festival I don't think a bias is equivalent to an explicit motivation to hinder black progress And people at Coachella don't get prison time P I think the racial profiling And all the police tactics are deplorable And those have been upheld by the federal government. But I don't think anyone any step of the way has had racial motivation. Except the co I don't pthink the main motivation is sto hinder black/Latino progre. ss though. I think people just assume that black/Latino people will grow up to be criminals and that getting them off the streets will 'lead them on the right path' and off of drugs 
And even their's is misguided--- they think they can get more arrests and convictions (which bring money to their department) if they go after minorities. And while minorities don't commit more drug crime, they are less able to fight allegatio When movnies advertise black and Latinso lives as those of crime and.
 drug use and violence there is a clear stereotype that officials in the federal government feel obligated to suppress  And most of those movies are spearheaded by Latino and black directors... One thought though that comes into my mind is the Al Capone defense, which I can't confirm as true 
That many homicides in ghettos go unsolved. It is not debatable that african Americans commit more violent crime. Because of the disdain for snitching, people aren't caught. So they go after people who they know to be bad on what they can catch them for-drug crimes. I'm not saying that's the right thing to do, but I would like to know how often this is the c So you'rae saying that convicting minosrities is a way of getting moe re $$$ by exploiting how uneducated they are??? Yes absolutely Which is awful Police departments should not have financial interest in arresting peo Accordipng to the US Department of Julstice, blacks accounted for .e
% of homicide offenders from  to , with whites .% and Other .%. The offending rate for blacks was almost  percentage points higher than whites, and the victim rate  times higher. Most homicides were intraracial, with % of white victims killed by whites, and % of black victims killed by blacks. Black people do commit more violent crimes but to say that police look for a reason to indict them and get them on drug use is absurd, especially when http//m.huffpost.com/us/entry/ It's not like the white homicide rate is SIGNIFICANTLY lower Nearly / Ummmm You very much misinterpreted Let me get my statistics together one DRC Ok then Sexplain()/attachm ent. Aned alsoP the Latino/bl ack dirc ectors mNay spearhead   the material butG
 unless you're in that loop you most likely will not hear about it  A study from the DOJ .x more likely to commit a homicide as compared to whites It is unpopular to look at offending rate because it is politically incorr Actuallye, I see your point. My fault cwas in the fact that I wasn'tt
 taking into consideration the differences in population. Right / split, but only % of the population is black, and % is white Also if you look specifically at young black males, the rate is incredible (as compared to young white males or the population as a whole) It is hard to come by the statistics because it is politically painful, but I will find it You usually see the victim rate Because that is palatable  http//ideas.time.com////viewpoint-dont-ignore-race-in-christopher-lanes-murder/ Written by a black professor at Columbia And I'm not gonna say the drug war has been fair-- it hasn't 
But the idea that white America is just as criminal is just not true. Maybe in relation to drugs. And maybe that means they should be held just as accountable for their drug use. But are violent crime rates the same? Hell no. And we should be working on fixing that too. Young black males commit murder at x the rate of young white males And I think I read it is .x higher than the national average murder rate And I'm not saying that's a justification for these drug laws and police militarization. I just wish this book acknowledged the origins of the crime problem inherent to some inner city communit It's paiinful to look at and necessarye to confront, but I guess thes
 harassment of innocent civilians by the police force and the overwhelming amount of blacks/latinos(what category are they under?? Doesn't say anything on the description for under) is just shocking and needs to be explained There was a correction I found that said many reports included Latinos under white Not for the one you sent but an earlier one I found Does it talk about the introduction of crack and other hard drugs to minorities? 
But the fact is that the police harassment is very overrepresented in media. It seems so common because you see it all the time on TV, but it's not nearly that common. That said, it's not ok and yes it needs to stop. But let's not look at the crime problem, and then say but police and disregard If you took only non-Hispanic whites the disparity would be larger What do you mean about the introducti The reasoon people bring attention to nwhite-on-black crimes more th? an black-on-white is because of the unfair legal action taken... Also I think that the movement is sheltering people from the harsh reality of black violent crimes RE your article 
Regarding the Al Capone defense, a good example is your uncle. He was convicted of a relatively minor crime but the fact is he was involved in a lot of deep shit, it was just that he was only caught with financial crimes.  Al Capone, a known murderer, was imprisoned on tax evasion. This book would count him as a non-violent offender.  I think the movement is trying to make the black community look good, and no lesser than any oth Yeah, wheen the CIA and DEA agents cirrculated cocaine throughout LA.
 to fund the anti-communist movement in Nicaragua So even this book doesn't push that idea In fact it is not that explicit at all The idea was that a few CIA agents overlooked it and allowed it to go on  And that one of the early dealers was being paid by the CIA, but was not an employee, for some reason linked to the Contras The fact that this (radical) book does not pursue that path tells me it is not a legitimate conspiracy theory It does say crack fucked shit up But the CIA link is very shaky to non-existent. I read this Brown Political Review interview with the biggest and first big crack dealer in LA  at the time And the way he put it, crack was a brilliant invention, and if not him, someone else would have been dealing it. It was inevitable from his perspective. Didn't need a CIA p Wait ok uquick question Can we meet usp today Please And read Weh

What if you don't take it seriously? What were your actual concerns? There was this funny quote from my savers training video. Remind me to tell you hahahah They were really easy questions-- it was clear what they wanted, but I could imagine some students answering how they actually feel, leading to lower scores I got 💯 But also during the videos they would ask you like or dislike and it would tell you the percent of students from Brown who gave each answer Some were like .% and .% Who is he?

Ya Idk you'vWe just been weird But that's fhine My mom this morning your by reakfast is organic so it's good ok ya but what is it lol I also had a stupid dream about you
 t About me?o Lol Or yourself hahaha Heor organic, I already told you! ! You You were taking a clothed shower with Reyna at my house without consulting me and you excluded me. And also some mom was in the bathroom with you gu I'm laughying rn omg The mom part killeds me I also had an exclusionary 
 dream that made me jealous ( 
We were invited to Saskia's first party at her new house and I was gonna drive there and we would meet up. When I got there you brought Oscar and you two kept talking and excluding me. Then you touched his butt and thought I wouldn't see and I was like UHHHUHHHH Also the other part of the dream was that Byroad (cool, hot drama teacher who, now that I think of it, looks like Alex Vause) came to Jay's party and had sex with students The shower thing would never happen though Yeah you would never shower clothed lol Lol that reminds me that Reza tried to tell me yesterday that he fucked a teacher and so did his friend because they needed better grades. And I was like sure and he more or less silently conceded And I'm sorry I don't even think oscar is cute so And he's kinda boring  Lol you atctually think I would shower wioth Reyna Who do you think I amo I wouldn't do it while we're still together and I wouldn't do it voluntarily. Maybe if I was drunk and we both got vomit on us the most I would do is take turns while in the same bathroom. ........ I mean at that kind of school would you really not believe that? Ok if there's anything you should listen to it's the new This American Life. Very relevant to our discussions and what you're reading, and also it gets personal and heartbreaking  Tbh I'd probably shower with a mom()/attachme nt.jpg Think of all the people

We started a college collaboration group chat to discuss common app stuff I am finishing up the first AL podcast right now ( minutes left) and I'll probably watch a movie after that 
Kittredge today to Claire asking why he's leaving not to belittle you since you're still a kid and you can't possibly understand why I would leave, but when an adult is offered a position of leadership and it impacts their career they take it Damn so I was righ ? About htim moving Also wink is good though  Ho.w do you feel about him leav I'm upset. 
 I iexpressed my concerns to him Kittredge ins more experienced, he taught us more reg cently, he is more aware of the BASIS culture. Wink is going to shadow in our classes.

I'm intelligent, he loves having me in class, I'm critical, I'm funny. I wanted to cry and I was so in love That's productive!!! Each step to organization is necessary. I'm glad!

You weren supposed to tell me Ugh well then I'll leoave now ()/attachment.PNS G Yes w I got homLe to literally do nuo thing. Some chores thatO took  minutes bup t   I've been listening to rL ent and writing That's too bad I'm taking Reyna home this is my first time using dictation so if it doesn't work I'm so ( http//www.trheatlantic.com/magazine/archive///the-coddlring-of-the-american-mind// Anyway have a gy ood one No no sorry I just got home I am reading your article right  Ok I'm not wonrking today But the article took a while foor me to read  Anyway I just feel shitty aw nd stuff so I'm still reading it Why do you fee shit Idk For one, tmy manager got upset with me for calling iny. Anyway I'm just really upset and blue ri? ght now So I feel like you talking to me wouldn't be good It's too complex for anyone to deal with by myself and I end up hurting people Alright, well I hope you work through it and do something that makes you hap *with but myseplf I don't think you ever hurt me but tyhat's No but I feel  like I can't have emo  tions without you gettoing upset I understand it's expression butk Well if you want to have this discussion Yes exac Ok but how do tyou think it makes me feel too I feel likel a bad person I feel bad for feeling anythy ing and for the way I act I feel like I should have just left work and gone straight home I'm so upset I fuck everything up I think you should take a nap This is just self-destructive Your boss was inevitably going to be pissed And if your job is going to upset you this much and put you in a bad mood, it would probably be best if you quit now rather than later in the w Ok but a lot oef it was also feeling uncomfortable with yoeu two It really doesn't matter anymore k Do you feel that you would have felt so strongly if you firstly didn't get upset from work, and secondly didn't retreat to the living ro I don't think obeing upset from work was a major problem. mThe reason I blamed work was because I wasn? 't there initially and you two had already done your things and whatever while I was gone So I felt like I was intruding on something already happening There - downtown or whatever I don't think that is fair to us. I'm not denying you felt that way But if you put yourself in my shoes  When you hang out with them alone, and at school, I have to deal with that constant Not that you rlesort to living rooms but you have been sady over it The reason I left was to give you 
 guys alone time or whatever Right but that's a big difference. I was upset but I didn't act out and let it affect later interactions so negatively  ?? What We di?dn't need alone time at all. How did you co?me to that conclusi I felt excludeod W? hat made you feel exclude It seemedn liked you guys enjoyed your company a lot ? and wh?en I came it didn't mean anything It's no   specific things but little actions to make up a whole. Like when you say I exclude you sometimes and I'm not. It felt like you both were (you more than her) While we did enjoy downtown, we wanted you to come and have fun with us entirely And that's fair, but going to another room to make the situation worse just heightens the issue and makes the whole thing uncomfortable  
Sergio, I know I have said this before, but I feel that you have really not taken into consideration how your actions in themselves perpetuate your feelings of discomfort. You need to find a more constructive way to deal with such situations. I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable, I understand and I am not disregarding t Why do you asshume I don't realize that? I just don't knowa what a constructive way to deal with that t is yet. Do you understand how upsetting it is when I encourage you to make an Instagram so we can all send links Or I grab both of you by the head to tell you I love you both You read the entirety of the Atlantic artic And then you'rle all telling secrets and stories and talkieng about some dance on a YouTube video Wha? t else am I going to do Telling secre Or whatever thte fuck What the fuck Ser What Thats gwas inflammatory, and wholly a result of ? emiotional interpretation and not a fair repreo sentation of the facts of the night at  Okay well I'm asorry I did not read the article in its enltirety There is a concept of cognitive l behavior therapy, and Buddhist philosophy, stoicism, many philosophies, that our view of life is distorted by our mentality, and that we can recognize and correct for these distortio I'm usually venry cynical I don't trust a lot of people Mse And, in my opinion, that would be benefi.
cial in the case of last night. We were not telling secrets. We were not acting unusually in watching music videos, something that is primarily your interest, not ours. And telling stories is no crime. You were upset from work and came in with poor attitude and didn't want to contribute; that does not mean we third wheeled you, that means you isolated yourself. When I ask you what is wrong and you don't answer and go be by yourself, that's not me isolating yo Oh my god but uit's not even a matter of the activities we. are doing. A lot of it is the way we act i  n the presence of other people, specifically Reyna. The attention dynamic Because you were withdrawn from the second you came into black crown And I tried to draw you in And you were being all gru You know what.m You're so right. I wasn't engaging in convpersation at the couch or holding you guys oy r anything. Or talking about my brother and BASIS or anything, basically Just me Super withdrawn But you turn on a dime One wrong move and you get all weird and then it's a snowball effe What do you wacnt me to do about this I want you to eitther externalize your feelings so we can re  medy the situation in the moment before it becomes problematic Or just let it go and continue trying to enjoy the company and bring yourself back to the center of the company.  And honestly at this point I don't care that much It frustrates me but it doesn't really matter  The point is that I care about you  And I want you to understand this issue so you can better yourself for future relationships Though I feel That this behavior is a manifestation of your insecurity with me And that if you were in a relationship you felt more secure in that you wouldn't act like this given the same scenario And so I hope you find that security that you s I guess sometheing that fucked me over is how you said youe loved me and liked me and whatever in th gk rade and then you said oh jk so fast But I couldn't agree with you more A situation like that would certainly lead to some insecurity issues with the same person in the future Basically, I'm really sorry for the way things happened and I appreciate your help You know the reason I initially was going to call in today was bc I thought picnic was today But that's alright That's what I thought the plan was  Oh!

It's nok mine is long overt due for your put off birthe Tangerine ! Hadhahah I forgot about that  Regarding the inasecurity from th grade though, while I very poy ssibly would feel the same way, it's really too bad that you felt that overshadowing our time now Ok  Food before? Cheap f 
 I understand tohat what we have now is stronger, but because oyou dismissed me for reasons (someone else prod vided more 'intellectual stimulation', etc.) and us initially doing things without commitment made me feel that at any time you could find someone better Like there's always someone better and you were the type of person to get that I mean I don't feel exactly like that now It's a lot less intense of a feeling It made me feel like I was in a competition with the rest of the world And I guess now I kinda feel that way with people you admire Which is unfortunate and I'm sorry 
I know this is kinda silly but There's a memory of me sitting on my ex-grandfather's bed, in his guest room, and you and Sophia were texting me. There was some hashtag thing.and I felt really insulted and stupid. Like there are just things you don't forget, idk. Of course, these thoughts don't affect the way I think of you directly. If there's any influence it's subtle and unintentional. It's only a reflection I care about you a lot and it's the last thing on my mind Food before sounds nice I've been wanting to try that Indian food truck but idk when they close Is fuddrucker's cheap. I don't remember? 
I was the type of person to get what? But yes, given the context I understand the initial desire for commitment with significantly greater clarity. Though it is very much too bad that continued to feel that way regarding people I admire. It's a bit suffocating for me, but I see the origin. I remember when I let her use my phone and you got angry, and wanted to assure it was me you were talking to after that. Lol no not really cheap Indian food truck is good if it is o Sonic, Taco Belpl, La Salsa The truck isn't doing dinner todaey ( Too bad Chick-Fil-a closes Sunday.

 w Sleep 😔 Goodnhirght!()/attachment.jpg , Wow When I saw the aat this morning I thoug h   it was a bruise Likt e something out of he pa  thology books that you wanted me to see Also my day went so much better than expected 
He came in at noon so I got to finish up some stuff, and he was still happy at the pro/con list, and the additions I made this morning, so he didn't seem to consider what I had done for the remainder of the last week at all. He said it was brilliant A+ work and that he had never considered many of the angles So, I am wayyyyy less stressed I also had a decompressing discussion with one of the office girls before he came in, she talked about how he stresses her out. Also, I realized I do my best work under intense pressure, which is unfortunate. How was your day? Probably less of an emotional roller coaster than mine I tend to catastrophize. Like if I fuck up one assignment I will fail the job and never succeed in life To be fair that's how high school can be Fail one test, and you have a C and can't get into the college you wanted And then you can't have the life you wanted And you get depressed And kill yourself Thanks Mr. Chambers 
Though actually I am still a bit stressed because the other office lady said that she had emailed him that there was zero tolerance for issues and imperfections in the meeting tomorrow and I haven't even rehearsed my presentat Hey Let mei tell you all the things -me Hey - you Jk oI do that all the t No sorry I'll rieply, jusn t on my way home I'm going to DC them -th Iwhich makes me sad because I think you'e ll already be gone Who are you taking tomorrow? Could you take Madeleine? I think I'll be here. But we won't see do I sound gay when it comes out Gonna leave on the I can take anyo ne, so yes We can see it the day I get back tthe  Right but the first night is with an ah nthropology professor q and a but that's ok Also  Did anyone ask if they would be allowed to leave school? I know you said you weren't planning to go to school And jay and Madeleine a Lol he needed yrou to provide an element of empathy for the loewer classes to his project. That's great thoug  h!  I do my best work when it's something I really want to do. Last night I wrote this bomb ass Carleton essay and it was the best thing ever. Like I have to share it with you Eh, I've learned to love and manipulate my shortcomings to work in my favor. A C doesn't mean much to me anymore. I know I'll do well because I want to. Kittredge thinks I have a good chance at Macalester and Reed Fuck.... That zero tolerances thing I rough. What's your presentation on? Who all are you giving it to? 
My day was great. We did a speed dating thing in research and I'm working on developing my research project. It's going to be about the formation and struggle to maintain a Jewish identity on college campuses, especially with all of this extreme liberalism and political anger I also switched out of capstone physics (THANK GOD!!!) into macrobio with all of my buddies (Joseph, Jen, Bella, Martha) Joseph was an excellent addition to my lunch time. I really like him a lot. Share! Giving it to you guys about the pros and cons of stem&m  So everything Il've already read That sounds like an interoesting project No I added some interesting thl ings How/why did you switch o Btw I intentionually included double affirmatives.  I switchetd out because physics is a bore and I don't wa? nt to read  pages of physics shit. I'd rather read about the animals. Yes Did you do that to mildly irritate me? Sergio Diviya is the only one that might need a ride Check with her? I haven't heard from her. I thought you said you did nothing in phys No? I did it beicause everyone thinks I hate him. Did it mildcly irritate you No no The double affirmats i Yes, I know v W I don't dislikeh him I am so confused e Oh you mean in the aJoseph statement I thoug  ht you meant in anotht er t Which one? eSo everything I've already re Oh no Carlxeat All in good foro ?

 s  o professional and dignif So does my writiing lol I sent it to y u Please don't hit mee It deepens my understanding for how she md anaged to succeed so much, together with my experience with her at Amherst. We had like such a great time talking. I felt like I'd never met her before like that It's not quantifiable but I disagree. I have never seen you write like she wrote in that email. Not that you can't, I just haven't seen it.  Not that professionally  When is this due I would prefer to discuss in person Not that there is a whole lot wrong with it at all Also what's your plan for the week I for one am free  Due sept I don't think i t sounds professional. it's very casual. I feerl like the average person discussing a common d app would talk the same way. Essay My google drive is being dumb Yes but it is long and it uses semicolons ugh Could you check your email It should have a request for acc I thought you seaid you read it already And wanted to discusss in person I did but I went to open it ons
 my computer To read it more seriously And it said I didn't have permission and even though the email was there it wasn't in my shared with me folder And yes I made sure I was in the right account Omg look up thesaurus Rex That's what I am Also today I had the opportunity to use the word ruminate. I don't even know where I got that word from, it just occurred to me in internal conversation to use it so I  That's what evedryone is Yeah but I feel like I especiallyi am Like I am constantly using it Whenever Id
 am writing something for r I wouldn't be seurprised if I use it more than you Bc macs haave the built in dictionary and thesaurus Alsol
 I already submitted my application Oh then why discuss And why do you do that You have time If you care about others input then you wouldn't do t I wanted to tryh one essay on my own and submit a first draft ato see what happens Ok but It's a stretcht
 for Carleton anyway Like if you just submit it and get rejected there are no conclusions to be drawn It could be because of shortcomings of the essay or for other reasons, you will never know But I know, and qui te frankly, I don't care all that much. I've oalready thought it through. But thanks for exk pressing how you feel. So that was really bitchy unnecessar All I said is Ii wrote a bomb ass essay that I was proud of Il didn't ask for any help You could have juy st said t I did You phhrased it in a mean  Phrased what? wI don't acare if I get rejected That's what I adon't ct are about The fly-in might make a diffy erence but the supplements are what matter Right but the way you mentioned that you didn't care about input was kinda mean It doesn't matter at all But it came off as dismissive AF instead of proud of yourself and confide I never explicintly said I don't care about input? I never satid that at all, as a matter of fact But t  hanks for expressing how you fee I said thank yolu for expressing how you feel about telling me. it is a stretch  Ok let's move on, text m isunderstandings I didn't mean to put it that way though So I apologize Anyway I liked your essay a lot tho No it's ok I huave no plans this week except volunteering stugff. I want to work tonight at black crown or sh omething but yeah. I wish I could go to saaf this week but I have a google hangout interview at Google hangout  interview? Yeah for Brown Political Review  I hate Skype and hangout was the other liste( d option What are you planning to work on toni Chinese homeworgk, essays, game theory, reading bio packet, anhd British accents Is hangout just IMing?

That's why I sai  d hey sorry; I thought I slept for so long and I sent that without checking the time How's your thing going Also may I ask why you check ftm forums but choose to remove yourself from it publicly  Lol yes and that gif Lol you slept then for like  min? I'm just chilling I think it's precisely because I remove myself But also its a bit compulsive Did you at least do the Chinese homew Can I tell you osomething Yeah, like  min utes actually.  r I still don't understand (exc ept for the comk pulsive part) but that's okay. ? I haven't yet. It shouldn't take too long though Ok so This is super fucked up and idk if you'll get upset or not There's really not a reason basically. I just do it because. Maybe I feel alone somewhere inside. But not conciliatory But during lunc h Jennifer said I should invite Oscar (she not,iced we got along and rapped nicki together   at Mady's) to Joseph's party since you'll be gone and Joseph said as long as I don't fuck in his bed Eh I think it's in poor judgment But it's not like you said that I honestly don't think he's that fun at parties, but that's my only object So you're actuailly not upset in any way? No not really Io mean on one hand I hope you abstain for like n a bit in acknowledgment of what we had and its length, but that is your choice and I won't judge you harshly. And also I'm not a huge fan of what Joseph said but I'm sure it was not in a mean tone. So no I'm not ups Yeah I don't theink that im gonna want to do anything with anytone for a while, especially a week and a half . after you leave  *especially not Do you feel the same way? About that? Like for yourself 
My hypothesis about why you do it is because since you're so removed from it you want to understand if what you're feeling is normal. Or, it's a way for you to sympathize, even though you have an aversion to it. You still feel like you should understand, regardless. What you're feeling is normal - compare your experiences to other ftm men In terms of hormones and relationships and discrimination, etc. I don't mean trans being normal lol Sorry I should've rephrased Anyway, back to original q Regarding the abstention- 
In principle absolutely, but I feel that I cannot say for certain. Moving across the country alone is such a big shift, I will have no good friends. It's more difficult to say with certainty, I feel that I will feel lonely. I don't think I'll have sex quickly, though.  I suppose but I really truly have already seen all there is to see It is repetitive  The posts at least The pics can be interesting I'm pretty sure I will abstain I am just a bit afraid Of what life without intimacy will be like Of any form not just  I feel so comfosrtable with my body around you Like I don't kenow I feel like we've shared so much You arex
 literally the first person to see my dick in confidence Idk / This is making me sad to think about Like I literally feel like crying And I worry so much because I hope that other people love your body the way I do I don't think anyone ever will Which is scary as fuck But also draws me closer to you  Like I really don't think it is possible to have a more considerate lover  Except like you + the ability to feel when it's the wrong h I'm actually croying Aimee oh my god This is so stupid I'm slorry Hahahah it's just dark sometimes! In the e light im always fine Lol I would take you with your occasional ass pain rather than a judgmental normal person who didn't stick it in the butt And day Any d I think somethiang truly beautiful is how after your surgery Iy wasn't repulsed in any way by your scars or a* nything Like I still found you as attractive and beautiful as ever 
And the most beautiful and hopeful thing to me is that I feel like you would feel and act the same way to anyone you truly cared about. If I was me but with some other kind of body I feel that you would feel the same way. I hope there are others like you  Lol I don't think scars are at all repulsive in comparison to my 🌺 and The way I think  of it is that I care for you so much more than anyone in my life right now, and your being is
 composed of both your body and your mind, and both impress me every day. That's what I've thought of every person I've ever been with While I reflect on the past, each person still holds a special place for love in my heart.

Lol anyway Is that really all she talks about It might be a ph Right but peoplae usually attain them after being illegal in the Us.S. For a while We were a bit the same way at e one point No? My parents had them right after legally immigrating You get them for legal immigration too But you are right they may have that connotation  In that illegals becoming legals get them  I thought it wotuld be something an illegal would get to attend coollege so that was my reasoning She said she didn'o t participate in any clubs or things bc she was high all the time, and she showed up to lots of classes high Jobi is a drug name lol How would I know that Did the professor say anything to you after May I say that I was/am inspired by you and I am proud of the things you have done And like you probably really don't believe me or think I mean it but yeah I feel like you made such a transformation from May-now and I think I'm also capable of doing the same Lol my mom left the garage open accidentally all day on the day we receive a $K check (which was supposed to automatically deposit electronically and not be sent) all good tho What transformation do you think I made? I feel that you and our friends but especially you have already transformed, and inspired my evolution. So I thank you too That's really sad actually That she was high and didn't do shit He said something nice when he gave me the certificate, that I was excellent or something, I don't remember specifically.  But after that no because he had to rush to a meeting Also, in a sense I feel I changed, in another sense I feel I just returned to the academic being I was prior to senior year and especially prior to junior year, when I had greater requirements  
I just remembered this humorous quote that I read in this book yesterday and it was saying against what Mr. Yager said chemistry is not in fact the study of how chemical dumping affect society nor the study of how society affects chemical dumpers. This was in response to Yager's desire to focus Science education around societal problems within the paradigm called science/technology-soci I feel like youe're not too shy anymore and you're willing to workt to get what you want Even though you say that I y still feel very dumb Yeah I'm mainly talking about this academic state and getting shit done Anyway Idk right now so I'm just a little worried to see how things will be once you're gone because you don't want to be with me and all Also, I'm eating some roasted red pepper hummus crackers (made from real garbanzo bean) and they taste like peas lol that's funny how of all days your mom forgets to close the garage. Although wouldn't it be in the mail regardless? Sorry I'm at the family friend's You know I was never clear on why the fact that the house was open was relevant to the check I agree with that sentiment kind of. I think I am still somewhat shy, but less! You aren't dumb bb What do you mean since I don't want to be with you? That doesn't sound appetiz Lol yeah neitheir do I. The open house is a problem on its own hahnahah. That safe zone sign in the telemedicine roog m hahah I also agree; more confident but not completely completely. It's impressive progress though How is the family friend today? Also, how did she turn out (socially, etc.) with all of the incestuous stuff that happened? Yeah, like you know how you don't want to be with me when you leave? I don't know what will be appropriate to talk about with you The concept of breaking up just because you're going somewhere - even though we've had a great relationship when you were in Cali - is bizarre to me. Like that its planned and you're okay with it Like you just don't care
 ,  Hi sorry just got home 
She is pretty good, actually. But awful with money. That is the greater issue. Also she gets depression sometimes. Overall pretty normal. She's not very educated so it's not like she spends her free time reading Shakespeare but she has a fulfilling life. It's not at all that I don't care 
But I really don't think it's possible to maintain in the long term, and so I'd prefer to make it a clean break and for us to continue as good friends, and we will figure out what that means. I feel that the alternative is a long slow and painful decline, because I just don't think long distance works.  It's not at all that I don't care I think it will spare both of us p Hi Yo yo yo Ia just woke up and I dreamt about you  I was so said because you didn't want to work a minimum wage jn ob with me and you decided to work at a gas station instead Then you were like, it's ok though. I still like you only because you gave me good 😛🌺 and I have hickeys on my 🌺. She sounds like an average American, not gonna lie; and there is no problem with that. 
I have thought about it a few times. Obviously there was the Anthony thing and what we have is a lot stronger, so I think about what would happen if we are emotionally committed but allow others to satisfy us sexuall . Then it comes down to a lot more things, involving personalities, and that's probably something you don't want to talk about hahah. The theory that there is always SOMEONE better for you no matter what. I believe that's true, but if I care about someone so much then that consideration doesn't even come across my mind Anyway, you are not awake and I shouldn't be? Haha. I had the best time today and I'm glad you invited me to be a part of it.

It's not even inconspicuous at this point. Jk kinda but it's pretty funny Yes let's hang out tonight. Where?? Maybe something other than black crown lol Lol rural candidate = % republican. He's probably hoping he can strike some nerve while they shake hands such that Obama goes into a coma At least Biden is white  Or kill Biden too cos the speaker of the house is republican  Lol Starbucks be targeting whites since  Or whenever the fuck they ope White people gontta stop at Starbucks at  am to get their morning ebuzz It's funny because I know the guy who is shad king his hand and he is very Latino/Hispanic Before they go to a productive job in which they work  hours a day To support their dog, stay at home wife, and  k He's a bodybuilider Lol really? You would think they would picdk an obviously ethnic kid if an ethnic kid at all.s
 Oh well, Obama can make up the ethnic quota for the  I guess it depepnds for tonight. Do you need to work or read or soimething? N Lol yeah. What'os kinda fucked up c is that the main link in Tucson pbetween -H and youth is the farm camp, which targee ts marketing at select schools and is $ per student   Volunteering isn't as exclusive, thanks to Tucson High's farm camp Latino parents go to the club fair They think their kid will empathize with the kid's grandparents Then the kids go to fuckin DC for a weekend lol and go to a farm for healthy living and nutrition Sometimes I worry about the millennials in the U.S. and how there's the entire anti-kid movement, but then I remember the south/rural areas exist. Elizabeth's snaps were great Do you think -H is effect It's beautiful ihow she decided to capture the library of all placves And also, is the whole Tucson village farm e affiliated with -H? Lol she spends so much time th Mr. Science, doe you know why assholes burn? It makes a lot ofr sense to me She hated being at home and didn't he ave internet there, so library it was.  Also nuanced It means that an argument or something has small but important facets or distinctions. That it isn't general, it has caveats or sophistications. It has subtle pieces that are important to it But it is also a buzzword That just like means Colloquially it has connotation that whatever you are talking about that is nuanced is well-thought-out, and unique.  You know, Ivies really don't have a need to charge tuition at all Ok maybe brown does because they broke as hell But Harvard, Yale, probably Princeton lol It's effective  for people who are in the loop. Some schools have n-H clubs and things like that, but it's selective.o
 The farm itself is a UA project, but -H asked to connect it to the youth. They make so much money off of their endowment (money in the bank) that they could continually pay for % of charged tuition room and board without any issue Fuck th Yeah I think abeout that all the time But if they have the opportmunity to exploit the privileged, why not? You know  ? Sure but they could at least be nicer Actually actua At least they clover a bunnnnchhhh for people who need it Thinlking about it It helps the elite If they were fry ee So many more would apply And the elite would be drowned out and less would attend, and less would donate later on Sure but that bunch is a drop in the proverbial bucket It's like affirmative action It doesn't help poor people as a whole  It sure makes it look like they care tho the reason manyu 'poor' don't apply to those schools is because I gdon't think all of them are aware of how much finah ncial aid is provided and the stereotype is that the schools are for the elite Exac It already doest help the elite, but I think that's changing Nlo they really don't know how much is available at y all I mean in general terms  I think the expyansion of schools like BASIS (one pro) is the inteegration of youth from all backgrounds Better ns ow by far than  years  And the dream tahat each kid can go to an ivy Lol but on such ga small sc So in that respaect, it's small but gro owing  I assure you thatl not many kids go to a BASIS with integration Note
 many BASIS schools have integration in fact The new schools in Phoenix, I hear they are overwhelmingly white/Indian/Asian No yes it's growing But at a stupid rate Can I bring the clothes for you today But I get your perspective-- it worked out for you, why not others Holy shit I read this article http//mobile.nytimes.com////opinion/stop-universities-from-hoarding-money.html Which provided fodder for the discussion with you Then I talked to my mom 
And she was like yeah over  years that's ridiculous and they must be investing in start-ups to make %, but in terms of stocks, the market tripled since the low point in -. So you could triple your $ just by investing in the index and not even making strategic choices. In fact, investing in real estate, not only did I make like % a year from rental fees, the value of the houses also doubled since I bought them Wtf She was like I bought a house for $K and now worth  Well I wouldn't$ know, it seems that the schools are in pretty racKially diverse places. My only problem is the priva te school with tuition in NY, but I know that's not BASIS's fault. What's funny is how I didn't even read the article, yet I'm still able to talk about it Like I spoke from experience And observations  Lol welcome to my life AP Lit I mean the idea from Yale is that they save more so that they can make more in the future  But it has become a bit abs I'll talk to youu later! I have school but I'll reply during free rperiod  Ok Lr Gr Check out Munk Debates. Thed
 concept is really cool. And the winner is chosen by which side manages persuades more to switch to their side, not which side agrees with one more. So the debate be it resolved that men are obsolete was won by the pro side by a wide margin. Though the method seems like it could falter to bias in that the people who come into the room feeling that way probably are radical and feel that way deeply, it's about / on whether the radical side wins. What are jay and Elizabeth doing as a result of liz's depart Jay told me thaut she's going out to dinner with him and his familry Yes you can bring the clothes haha Fuck college es have so much money.

Thats pretty sad actually Do you think most of the church people are a bit unintellig I read an articlee a few minutes ago about how a kid recognized that snchools don't teach people things, and that independent t study is more effective. The article was not compelling in any way and the kid was just as stressed out. I really do. A lot of them went to community colleges (both kids and adults) or just live on their plots of land and tend the animals. The people bring fresh goat cheese and wine and shit There are a select few, of course I disagree with that sentiment so much Oh they are rur So do I. I enjoya being well-rounded and I claim credit to school.   lA lot of them are. Many live in those community homes?

But yeah And the nature of their relationship was constantly unclear Maybe that was the point, the ambiguity, but it pissed me  I thought that boecause teenagers are perceived as inconsistent and irratfional that was the way the movie was formatted and writtf en She was the only mature one of them all()/attachment.JPG Oh so Reyna did another one of her stay the day thing s Only til  When she was drunk and out she lost a s  andal and a towel outside. My mom asked me about it, she was like wtf That's a good explanation Also possibly induced by his alcoholism and how he placed emphasis on others rather than himself so he didn't work out his feelings We  I see That's soh sad. Nobody suspected that she was fucked up or anythinog. We all thought her and Veris were doing things. Alsot
 I'm surprised Veris didn't call anyone Yeah he's all about the relationships around him It wasn't until the end where he sits to write his paper and reflect He did pretty quickly I don't think she was barfing for all that long before we c Ya()/attachmeant.JPG It's a panorama There was a new mountain fire mtoday S m I flew over it Mae Did you see it?

 lol.... What are you gonna eat? Jennifer and Joseph call/text each other so much lol Like we finished dinner and we have to go to yoga now but Jen and Joseph are on the phone So I'm just sitting in a teen lounge waiting I had one small burger because it was cheap and I forgot my credit card So I rounded up some backpack change I think they talk over phone a lot, but probably not as much text as we do sometimes But I mean idk How is that http//money.cnn.com////investing/stocks-market-crash-by-the-numbers/index.html Be in the financial know! Sorry that was for the tortoise didn't know it was recording O You send your toortoise recordings lol? No no I was telling her to wpake up, jokingly And while that was happening I hit recs ord and didn't notice  Oh lol I thoughtl you spoke during work and sent recordings to your mom foor your tortoise How was work? *During yoga class* Teal cher breathe and you might feel light headed. It's like a natural high. But that's the only type of high you should ever be! *audience members start clapping* They text a lot too I'll read tonight! Hey I hate to say this but I need my new Jim Crow back Also I defend my comment about your mom's outfit. She looked like . Work was fine, but I anticipated being done after today. It was my last day in the office, but I still have a solid couple hours of work Lol who clapped? What conte Ok that was realxly rude Like I don't appreciate hearing that Ok it'ts just an outfit Sergio We all have our off days Wasn'? t meant to be a personal attack! Sorry ( I don't deny that my mom sometimes looks li yeah I'm planninkg on giving you the book back. I don't think I can finiseh it hahha, but you probably already figured that out Y  ou have work right now? Awww I'm sorry. I hope you get it done soon! Do you want your own copy? Do you think you would otherwise read it? I'm gonna do it tomor Lol some moms clrapped right after the comment  I would read it except Io've been busy, obviously At the -H conference dance parw ty Sergio damn I really want to twerk  A southern girl from Arkansas taught yoga lol What're you doing tonight? Ok well goodnight Hey sorry are you actually going to sleep I was working on some shit Lol of course Arkansas would say that I'm cleaning up, might watch a movie later, probably won't work No I'm not but IW keep forgetting the time difference so I assume you're basleethe  I'm at a dance party Is it  What movie mu ightf you watch tonight? It's awesome because we have no bedutime  Last night I was up until  Breakfast is from -amn It's a lot of fun. Everyone gets down Sergio mormon boners when they touch hands The Utah kids only got up to dance for Life is a Highway and Cotton eye joe Tennessee DJ leave room for Jesus Louisiana girl Jesus is already in my heart so I am watching the Boys in the Band and it is so confusing It's like gay references that aren't relevant  And the cast is mostly gay, except the super flamboyant gay who is portrayed by a straight actor Weren't you tired? I am so glad to not be there lol, I would hate it What do the straight boys do Lol Utah  Also it's hilarious that the DJ is saying that I haven't heard that shit since ever What song is that I can't he What's that moviae about? It was some country song that referenced Arizorna, but it's a glimpse of the country music they've been 
 playing The southern kids turned Spanish music (requested by the Puerto Rican representatives) into a line dance Not really. Madeleine got me sick ( Lol I doubt you would hate it. The kids are actually so nice. My roomies make fun of my accent lol and we stayed up late talking The only thing though would be the humidity outside!!!! The straight boys also dance.  They're more fun that our straight boy groups  Like even as a gay I can actually talk to them and we laugh and make jokes. They're more relatable. Lol I haven't heard that shit since never. It's honestly a first. It's about a group of gays in  who somewhat accidentally invite a straight boy What accent? The gay one? I'm glad you enjoy their company, someone has My roommate is l istening to country music in the shower Have I been anntoying today lol A straight boy into the gay friendship o group? What is it? An AIDS support group or something? That's not funny He's a college friend of one of the guys And most of the actors died of AIDS later And no you haven't been annoy What's not funnyi I'm not making a joke about anything I was joking n Cos earlier you were like that's so rude about what Ig
 said I felt I had the same party-pooping ri Ok. But what youg said was actually kinda rude It's different when peoplhe say the decade thing about your mom bc it comes from at
 place of admiration  With you, not so much Ok but what you said conformed to a stereotype which has pained many people That's not t ??? You said it'rs about a group of boys who accidentally invited a straiught boy without giving any context whatsoever I was aske ing questions Was it for a sleepover Anyway  Have you thought about breaking up before you leave? Like what are your thoughts Sergio seriously I was joking Lol no not for a sleepover though that would be sexy For a dinner party, somewhat but not really similar to Cage Aux Folles I want to hear your thoughts fi Idk I feel like ryou don't really care about me anymore and I guess whatsever you want to do with that information is whatever yot u do I feel like you are upset with me tonight So let's drop this topic for  I'm actually notn upset I wod rather talk about this now I would ratoher talk in person. And even if you aren't upset, you sew em far from neutral, saying that I don't care. That's not true at all. It's probably influenced by the fact that I have been bad at messaging tod 
 if you want to atalk in person there's obviously something you also havey to say And like especially because you asked me Wh. Lol the one straaight guy at the gay sleepover would be sexy He would prtobably feel really uncomfortable Yeah I want to know wh? at you think You also already know how I feel about the whole thing I was only expressing how I thought things were on your side But you already know what I think about what happens with us You're the one who switches between being only friends when you leave to breaking up to watching movies as a date What? Sergio I think I have made it clear that I want us to be friends If you can't handle talking and watching movies when I'm gone then I can abandon that venture, it was never meant as dates, just to stay cl Ok yeah so do yoou think it'd be best to end it now No, because I thisnk we should hang out when you come back and it would bee
 awkward  Ok ?? I gAuess thisO is because I'm upset and I would rather get oFver it sookner And because you take this stuff better t  han I do I? t's like I'm leaving this part of my current life and you're going on to the next part of yours 
I'm not denying that's true, but I think it would be best to make the most of what we have now, and stay together and be happy together for the last few days. This argument of it's futile has persisted since the beginning, and we haven't given into it. Why now? I would love more than anything to get breakfast with you on , and say what we will. I understand your pain, but I think it will be a regret if we don't meet up, or meet up in a bad mood But ultimately it's up to y Also there are tohings like sitting next to Jennifer and seeing missed caulls from Joseph and texts like I LOVE YOU!!! You're the.
 most amazing person in my life and shit like that But I mean I guess it doesn't matter that much Don't make that influence th You're right Thiat's mostly what it was I'm sorry for acting this way sI was feeling lonely all day It's ok, it's an emotio! nal time. ( Well now I am done working so I have more t Jennifer was witih me but I mean not really because Joseph and her talkedm for like an hour We have a lot of free time at this the ing Do you have a laptop and Inter calling it trainning is kinda a joke because we do yoga and eat ice creame I do, but my roommate and I are watching family guy / t What's the main event? Has it start It's his first teime lol Lol are you gonna finish that at some poi Tdhere is no mainn event. It's like a fun retreat Oh? . Finish what? t We. did this poverty simulation I have to tell you abou? t wh.en I see you in person The family guy Lol yes that . sounds interest Lol family guy iisn't all that demanding My roommate doesn't have TV Whnere do you want to have breakfast? Right I wanted tog
 skype tho Lol wow Does he have Internet Mm cafe pa I wanted to skypse too but I would feel bad because he's talking to me absout chick flicks I wanted to skype watch a chick flié ck  He's like what lmovies do you like! I like chick flicks (emphasis on choick flicks) Can we watch on I have no headpheones (l You want to know my logic? I was like, well )  I'm going to a healthy living conference, and ) people t( hese days talk to each other and connect, psh, who listens to music anymore! Like the progressive youth are rebelling against technology and going to coffee shops to connect again But I was so wrong I feel left out So I have to tell you about my flight and TV and the poverty()/attachment.JPG ( This is sad Alright! I mean you just watch with
 him? But I guess that is it Out Cute building I'm g  lad you are finally traveling Though it's sad that you have such limited free Haha well you endjoy your movie bb < I just watch with him? What do you omean? My other roommates got back and they invited me tm o skip conference dinner and explore the city to get dinner with them  Aimee the houses in Maryland are fucking gorgeous. The ones nearby our conference are all at least $ million They're like all antique politician homes 
 too. At least I have the D.C. city tour tomorrow Today Jennifer and I got to explore maryland's Chevy chase in the morning and we went to the nicest CVS ever We walked around for + minutes Oh I meant with the roomie but it's alrightn Alright!* Maryland has the highest median household income Of any state! Fun Fact. Chevy Chase? Wow  minutes!!!!  $K How humid is it I love how clean my room is now And if I didn't have work hanging over my head I would feel fre I learned that teoday actually. The Maryland fun fact. If I become more i nterested in history then I wouldn't mind living here fo( r that and commuting to D.C.  the more I travel the more I fall in love with American territory Yeah Chevy chase is the city I'm staying in I feel like I'm in the Amazon Ok lol not that humid but I mean you can't walk outside without sweating I did yoga today and I am relatively unstressed  I can't believe he's still having you do work the week before you leave Oh, I thought that was a guy on SNL Not a place  Shit it's that bad?!? I know. I know.  I want to be done and free Enjoy my last week in peace So I'm gonna do it all tomorrow I hate it I hate having black clouds of assignments looming over me Especially when I am expected to do them on my own time Otherwise I can say, oh well I'll do it when I get in on  You know what he said today? He told his kids that his family is B-Intolerant, and that if they get anything but an A in college, he will stop paying And so his kid calls and says there is a class at Harvard that literally one cannot get an A in, and so he says to get the prof to sign and send a letter confirming that no one has ever gotten an A.  The kid got an A. Both kids ended up with a perfect GPA Fuck.  I could not deal with that stress I'm slowly coming to the realization that I would be perfectly happy becoming a middle of the road doctor Not one who wants any leadership Just one who does the time, goes home, enjoys the $ Any ambition of mine works from - and - onl lol a guy on SNLy. How specifically random. Or you could have gotten it .all done today and it would feel like you have more free 
 time But also I enjoy procrastinating and the prideful feeling of FINALLY being done, you know? Like wow I finished that and I feel proud of that fact Anything but an A overall or on certain tests? He told me one of the kids who worked over the summer killed himself cos of poor performance in college (also underlying reasons) No I worked all day No stops I could not have finis I mean I know avherage GPAs are high in college but sometimes bad days (wehich correlates to bad scores) is a real thing I coud ld have come home and worked more I guess  It is a guy on SNL though A in the course  lol are you kiddling me. That's ridiculous that he called him He saido he regrets graduating from college th in his class cod l everyone in his family is Phi Beta Kappa (basically valedictori Yeah exactly I waas imagining my own job on my own terms. Not stupid fuckning savers where I'm required to work  days a week or I') m fired. Today as I walked by the Maryland homes that's exactly what I thought about How funny ....... No he didn't call he prof. He told his son to get the prof to send a letter or deal remai That suicide thinng is really sad What did he think of it? He was vesry sad Idk he didn't talk much about it He said many o  f the kids he has seen have trouble adjust I mean I understiand that he wants his kids to succeed but how can he notn connect the pressure to that To his own kids You wantg
 to know something stupid Don't judge me W But I thought thhat Phi Beta Kappa status was a sort of fraternity award No It's an honor society Like a big big d You're t totally jeudging me lol Tbh I did too tho Until this morning a Well I didn't think it was a fraternity but I wasn't sul re what it w Best Partier laol Diviya's college recognition at her graduation Maybse Charlotte intentionally chose to be in a sorority beca  use it's an ethnographic study and she's planning to fuck them over and graduate valedictorian Have you ever thought of that? Pretty clever bitch, hmm? That's something I would do A lot of the things I say are things I would do tbh Maybe she wants to show the world she can drink  nights a week and still pull a . It's funny because Diviya is really not so party-y since like..

I was y(obviously) very pissed off and you were like stop acting lik! e a girl. You're being pathetic Then I dropped to the floor because your dad was coming and he walks by and sees me on the floor lol I was awake when you texted me but as I was responding I fell asleep ( That's so weird. At least all the rich white conservative men who work at Raytheon are slowly dying off and being replaced by educated PoCs and genuinely nice people Ok ( take lots of pics for me boo boo! lol did you say good bye to your house It's funny how I will actually be at your house last, not you I think my monologue will also be from the rent script book Are you only headed to Newxico today? That's such a sad dream, shit. He sent me a drunk snap about sucking a cock but I missed what he was saying at the start of the snap.  Clearly not about me, hahaha I can feel the Raytheon sarcasm from here Lol didn't really say bye to the house. I did have a moment going into the garage like shit I won't be here for a looooong time Let me know when you choose a monologue. Though I'm not sure much in RENT would fit as a monologue Yep! But like Northeast NM I will take pics! We are driving through like four nature preser()/attachment.PNG I wov nder why Raytheon would have a GLBT alliance though. and whye  would they sponsor a highway lol?!! Kiss the ground and swis m   in the pool one last time When I leave for college I won't be saying bye to much (in terms of the house) Oh that's pretty far. You should stop at Juarez P What conditions were you given for planning your road trip? That is insane. I'm really jealous. Maybe I'll drive your same route next year Jk lol Why Columbus, Ohio? Gonna go see Anthony hm Yes lol I saw that on your phone, the patriot stickers I guess they wanted to show they were good people or some shit Or just get fame like all gays do by having a sign Lol I have swam in my pool so few times actually ( Hahahaha...... no on the Juarez Plus we don't have passports on board P Well it had to be ~ mi per day to make good progress  So that was the big thing My mom planned most of it tbh For no good reason at all I have believed for a long time that Ohio is a wonderful and beautiful place.

Sh e took a pic of them m Lo  l in Chevy chase I   saw a church with a 
 sign promoting bible study, but with the rainbow colors in the background D.C. is primarily liberal and that's one reason they're denied representation  Go into Juarez once, say bye bye to Brown They'd strip you dry Too bad you didn't go into Tennessee ( I told my friends I tried Popeyes for the first time a few weeks ago, and they said the food at Popeyes is NOTHING compared to all the chicken in TN they said they could throw a rock in any direction and hit a chicken place *chicken joint Have you ever realized what people are actually saying when they say let's blow this joint Lol I mean I know how you feel about makeup. How attractive it makes her. Ohio is where one of the headquarters of my church is and where one of the church colleges is 
I left my room to see if I was home alone and I could practice my songs, but my grandpa was reclining in his chair and he said he wanted to talk to me. Okay, that's fine. He told me that in his day not going to church on the sabbath was a mortal sin, and that skipping meant going to hell. He asked me why I didn't go today and said that I need to place God first (over you and whatever else I did today) because I have been blessed immensely I'll let you know about all the food I try on the way I hope to get Missouri BBQ Think about it I don't think the people who make that shit have that capability I never thought of the representation issue that way That actually makes a lot of sense Omg popeye's fucking awesome damn that was a good date 
 What did we do that day before popeye's?? If you remember  Ohio I fee is just all over the place, but interesting because it is sort of a crossroads It touches Kentucky (South), Indiana (Midwest) and the east coast  Lol so you did get the talk What I also don't get is that nowhere in the bible or anything else Is it like you need to go to church Or like anything Like you could just quietly believe to yourself and go to heaven Blowing a joint will either a) put it out because saliva + fire b) waste valuable drugs Depending if you are blowing like a whistle or a cock Like a whistle or like flo rida's whistle It's so dumb that I'm just typing Florida with a space On Death, Sex & Money, I just saw an episode called Big Freedia bounces back  I'm listening to that lol Did you mention bounce? Something in the so I was not aware that uMissouri BBQ was a famous thing. All I know about Missouri is tthe St. Louis arch. They have toasted ravioli though! That souh nds fucking amazing. I feel like BBQ is not unique to one state in the south lol Before Popeyes we went to the library and looked at your bedding, I gave you presents, bought that feminist book, you saw my buttons, we looked at the college rape quotes project Then I had to go to work ( How do you remember this  Anthony never talks awbout Ohio much, but I think of it as shit shit shit Kenyon witth liberal arts hipster kids and then shit shit shit surroundif ng it Did you look at our old te I remember him going xto a county fair in Columbus and that was only time he was haptpy to be there lol Indiana is the shit.

 a lot because I thought it was super sophisticated Ooooh where are you now You can send location! The houses still look kinda shitty though. If I were never born you would still be a fuck up YOU blessed me .. I thought wrong that big Freedia was female I'm big Freedia, the queen diva, the dick eata', ya besta' believe her I'll send location 
  attachment.vcf That seems like an unlikely song to remix Lol it was a rest area Lol that's for fanning my ego b Than How realistic/problemkatic is Bernie's plan to make public college educations tuitiosn free?  Big Freedia is a female! I said something as in one * thing/artist out of a few other things/artists  For the Bernie thing because I mean these are clearly things everyone wants, but how will it be executed? Oh lol you're not very far. A little past benson. we never went to Benson pride ( I heard it and it was actually pretty dope https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=tFDhdaY Big Freedia is a gay boy sergio Bisbee pride yeah Maybe next y NO WAY I feel so dumeb now I think it is pretty realistic tbh Like in most staates for most students it doesn't cost that much now anyway. Arr izona is the exception  The big question to me is what about out of state student tuition Lol we only left after  LOL I felt sophisticated by Adele too The remix wasn't bad but it also wasn't very different at ()/attachment.PNG Theya
 all look  Yeah, that is why I'm trying to stay away from anly
 public universities until I get my undergrad. I know I knol w, 
 but it also means your parents follow the speed limit lol I can't believe the Grammys or other music awards used to be such a part of my life. I used to know who won what Grammy how many times. I also can't stop thinking about if Carly and jay fucked last night That bothers me a lot Are you gonna change your name soon? ) Omg they all do look , literally Because AZ costs $$$? Lol he actually is  under It saves gas 
 is the ideal speed for MPG that said, I would pay the $ or whatever to get there an hour earlier I feel the same way about the Grammys  But one day I may feel that way about the oscars I suppose I really don't think they did Did she fuck Foxb Fox? Yes I need to do that on this trip  WATCH THIS http//m.moutherjones.com/contributor///starts-chanting-kiss-kiss-kiss-kisgs-kiss-kiss-kiss-kiss-stops-chanting How could anyone in the h military support that piece of shit No, because ) I would not stay in AZ (I've finally come to realize that) and ) if I did look at public universities they would all be out of state Lol that's funny. I get where they are coming from but like you said, they're not saving hella bills  Raad thinks the oscars are not credible or reliable sources for movie critiques And he also thinks they're an injustice to great low-budget independent films No, she didnt. At your party she explained it to us; fox said that he wasn't feeling it anymore so he broke up with her You schooled that radical activist oh my god Where'd you get the guts for that necessary confrontation  What is it with republicans getting so turned on by people exercising unjust power  
 This whole we need a real man to stick up for America attitude is a disgrace That's personal AKA I don't have a favorite bible ver Maybe you should hit sup a Trump conference!!!!! Lol like literally who gives a fucek Tea party as libertarians but only as long as it doesn't 
 conflict with their morality Also veterans as rd class citizens my fucking ass You know honestly Besides how much I hate hearing his voice and the dumb rhetoric His policy points aren't all that bad like really I think he also just likes to drive slower And my mom likes when he drives slow 
I would agree with Raad's sentiment, though I do think they are reflective of something. It's like IQ-- I don't think it is the ultimate standard of who is most intelligent, but it does indicate something if you score terribly or fantastically Jay said that He said he was in love with another chick And she thought he might have cheated Ok but that journalist was not in line with the rules that govern the profession... As a journalist you just don't act like that Still, the show did piss me off I honestly had to pause a couple times to keep it together If trump did Fordham transfer to UPenn, you can too. You know, Trump is like a shitty knockoff version of Reagan Oh shit he called out the silent majority That is right out of the Nixon/Reagan playbook Omg Your mom sounds like Sarah plain Palin I just reali The only policy pointzs I picked up from that interview were support for the middle eclass and higher taxes on the upper class. It's nothing all thd at new. Also he transferred because he wanted to go to the real estate school and he was rich Kittredge was explaining why some people with .s get into ivy leagues, and he was like their daddy probably donates $ million a year and built the school's library I'm now in Newxico but I saw no sign welcoming me He wanted to simplify tax code Improve infrastructure  Reorganize Yeah, I think that if  the oscars didn't call those movies to my attention then I woVuldn't notice some of them. Also, they really do tend to be soA me of the best. Jay's in love with another chick?! What???? That's not fucked up??? ......???? Right, they are almost never bad movies No no Foc Fox Jay said Fox was in love with another ch That's true. When I siaw the video of the journalist it was hard to overlook the bracsh behavior. I could barely hear you in the audio recording lk ol Yes, however I understand that a lot of policies in these platforms are universal, and ultimately the candidate with the best wins my vote Lol that's weird since you entered from such a major highway What do your parents do in the car? What radio stations do they listen to? Yeah, I think my mom and her have a similar look Psh image voter Jk image does matter  They just talk endlessly I was saying the $ million quote as I imagined Kittles wo What words did you coume up with for the Carleton word association Here's mine Knowlledge - theory Play - tuba Future - hover board Well those vid ews are exclusively his in this race, and I think he's a disgusting person so That's true, but it's in the patronizing mother way Or the self-assertive even if I'm wrong way Kittles!!!!! That sounds beautiful You never answered my question about your parents lol They just talk endlessly They don't listen to ra Oh I thought you wered talking about my mom about what kinds of things Idk I juist chose whatever I didn't write it down. I thought those wereo
 just meant to be si Take naps bye Yo sielnto mal por mucho hablando conmigo  Creo que mucho vas a makel you annoyed with me Although I'll break my promise for a secy It made me so sad when you asked me if you would still be in my circle of people I plan on talking to after high school Bc I feel like we have gone through so much together that the answer is obvious I haven't lost you the way I have with some people over the summers and school years Or lost you at all, for that matter One thing I fear about moving in with someone is losing the spark you once felt because you see them so often But I guess if we had work and school and stuff we would constantly miss each other and be excited to come home I love that my grade refers to you as our favorite senior 💖 In our hearts you are in the same grade as us lol Don't forget to count the number of confederate flags you see along the way 
I wasn't even that sad about you leaving because I had a great morning, but then my mom brought it up and started saying things like separation heals the heart and I know it's tough, here's my separation story... and making it all sad so I almost cried again I am not annoyed with you at all! I was having such a good time chatting Newxico terrain is boring AF now a bit better  Wait no, it was a bit better in las cruces, now it sucks again Anyway I took a nap Aw I love the favorite senior label Lol the count stays for now where it started  Mom always has the way of making things so much better ;) Hopefully you will soon forget what she said and remember how great the morning was I was being a bit facetious about the after high school thing, don't think that I thought you wouldn't talk to me Sorry that I don't have more photos yet We stopped that one time, and then at a gas station in the middle of las cruces I think the next will be of a lake next to a town called Truth or Consequences, no joke I don't get the porn hangover, like do you just get tired?

 Internet or servic  e where we are head  ed, so if you don't hear from me, that's what's up We're out of Albuquerque n Lol those were my thooughts exactly. Have the men do it. Those sculptures and the awrchitecture are crazy!!!! Malleable because males think they . can have women conform to the patriarchy  That's really insane. I was invited to apply there but idk. It seems trendy but I think it'll get old fast, you know? They're probably expensive as fuck How've you been today? Does your booty hurt  I feel like last night we transcended some sort of feeling  I can't explain it though Also I've been wondering why you said that to me last night because it just replays in my head but I feel like it wouldn't be special with an answer Although I kinda do want one hahaha Have you interacted with any people yet Ok I'm going to tell you something really fucking stupid A couple of weeks ago (this was in front of people too, like Diviya and Keizer) Zayna said that I need to break up with you or she wouldn't be my friend anymore And I told her no, that if anything we deserve to leave on good terms  And she was like 'he doesn't deserve good terms' But anyway, fuck that because it's not her relationship???? Are you staying every night in different hotels? I was afraid you were going to say that you said you would, and that's why you didn't want her to see me when we went to the rillito That's manipulative and disgusting I said it because I felt it was the right time I feel like that is an answer that is an answer without ruining the mysti And it was sad too beqcause when Joseph was going to see you during lunch he said yuou guys are gonna hate me for this but I'm gonna see Aimee ane d that disgusted me I feel like things go too slow in Albuquerque for you to enjoy They are $$$ too, for out of state I have only interacted with a store clerk, to ask for no bag  I have been feeling kinda sick all day That actually makes me wanna cry a bit I feel that he didn't say it because he felt any negative feeling But it still hurts a lot that he couldn't stand up and unabashedly get lunch with me Probably best western or Holiday inn most nights I'm so sad about all this With Zayna But I'm glad that you said what you did I'm holding back tears, and you know how uncommon that is for  Honestly it's really mpathetic and ironic how she says these things about you being eabusive, yet she's attempting intensify hostility between you . and everyone else *to intensify  I think that the people who know you know the truth Reyna, Martha, Diviya, etc. and especially me love you and care for you so much Her words mean nothing to those who love you And it sure is a lot more people for you Nobody would treat you differently because of what she says And it doesn't change my feelings for you Lol yeah, although I've been considering it and I feel that NYC is too fast for me I don't know what I'm comfortable with Hahaha no bag! What did you get? Also the no bag is supposed to sound like some realization in a movie It's funny how you had simple interactions; 'no bag' You can type now Sorry Also are you two hours ahead or one? It's  here Ok and the present I was embarrassed to give you was a collection of poems I wrote for you But I can send you one a night I was crying for like  minutes but I think it's out now Big Freedia helped me Thank you Lol NYC is like the end of the spectrum on the busy side  I got two fruit punch powerades, and a white chocolate macadamia clif bar (tastes the same as every other clif bar) Lol I actually said naw I'm good when she started to pull out a bag Nope, it is  here. So just one That sounds wonderful I feel texting Zayna just a short thing, not a mean thing, just something to express the results of her actions  But that is probably a bad idea Don't feel bad about the number of your texts at all, ever. ) 
I felt that a lot changed for me last night, which is the longer answer to the why question. I felt certain. I realized how far we had come, how I could tell just through a brief facial expression how you were feelin . I finally felt the gravity of our connection. I found myself weeping at leaving you; I felt pretty fine about all the rest, not that I don't enjoy their company, it's just differen I felt the same way ltast night Like it didn't take sex to make anything happen bec.ause I felt it all night I can't easily ask you for coffee or 
 see you whenever I want I've cried at least  times at work today You have been all I think about The reason I'm not replying is because my phone is % but I promise you I will reply to every last thing before I sleeping  *sleep By the sex thing I mean that having sex wasn't what made me realize anything, because all night I felt so connected and in love Haha I understood. Alright! I'm getting into the hotel now, anyway, so I can't really text. Great tim ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Text me befiore you go to slee  Will do for sure Sunday ,  n I feel like Newxico is like AZ with this tradeoff ) NM is g more liberal ) NM has even less jobs ) NM has less diverse and less pretty nature ) NM is more sparsely populated (for better or worse) ) NM has more a Where u at bb  I'm srtill at work ugh Holy shit boy I am going to sleep soon (t I am in Santa Rosa NM I am hun Hahaha I'm so upset gugh   Well then I'll reply to you while you're asleep at this proint But you're so special to me!!!!!! Why ups That I coy uldn't talk eto you as much We have no real food here so I am eating frtuit all day I feel bad for Looking up the song this morning ? Though we talked while I did that, I still feel bad But seriously don't feel bad about texting, we can text ad infinitu Looking up what song mhaha Good night 😘 The one that was on the radio in Brueg ge Oh hahah that didn't rbother me at all. I had fun humming ) the unfamiliar song, don't' worry Goodnight!! 😘❤️🐢 Thanks Big Freedia 🙏🏾 maybe I shs ould start listening to that. One thing I feel bad for is saying I will start a project (anything-- listening to music, writing a paper) and then forgetting about it Lol that sounds like the worst dinner ever. I feel for you. Was dad's packed food not good enough haha or did you guys finish it all? That sounds like a bad idea. She would spread it and nothing would be solved. I would be secure knowing that you have friends who love you no matter what, and that's certain. Also I'm sorry you're sick! I hope it wasn't from me 
Those things you listed about NM are all things I've assumed, and now I have an ethnographer to report back to me. Thanks! But really, none of those things (except maybe with the exception the art or some perks of liberalism) sound appealing. You listed like every reason why sound minded people avoid those areas lol. 
For the longest time I've known that I love you. You are my favorite person and the person I trust completely, more than anyone else. I care about your opinion more than anyone else. I feel that I empathize with you on a level that I am incapable of doing with other people. When you told me that last night my throat clenched and I felt like everything in my life was finally secure. I literally can't walk around anywhere or even write this message without my throat tightening and without crying. It's entirely indescribable  Whenever quarrels between us would arise I was always certain we could overcome them You don't know how badly I want to hold you against my chest in bed and stroke your cheek and feel your stubble against my fingers How much I crave to fill the space underneath your fingernails with mine I miss you so fucking much already I can't even remember what it's like to be upset with you in any capacity because my entire heart swells with love for you()/attachment.jpeg Wel l Here's the poem for tonight I inhale your sweet scent on m y fingertips continuously for days It is a reminder of how I   stride down to fill your soul and how you can become a wet rainforest in seconds  the curve of your back is pounded against car doors and brick walls  we chuckle at euphemisms and save the intensity for your crucifixion you extend your hands like jesus as I press them against every metallic and plaster surface()/attachment.png Good night 😇 Saw my first anti abortion and bible signs in New xico. This town is like a time capsule. It was on Route , l  ots of the business dried up so there are tons of boarded up spots. Also a closed gas station advertising  cents a gallon, though I'm not sure if that's from the dip five years ago, or like  years ago.  I feel bad about not completing things that I say I will too Especially when I start  Lol the NM list was meant to be a tradeoff- the positives and negative differences I have felt the same way about the quarrels.  I know I am not giving a long response to what you said about us, but I don't want to cry in the car right now  I just got into Texas I love the photo still And the poem haha And the cute duck omg What's up?? I'm in Adrian TX, at a cafe that flo's cafe from cars was inspired Hey! I was in bed fo r two hours doing nothing. I woke up at am, even though I wentb to bed around  Last night it was sad because a barely passaby le trans woman came into savers to buy jewelry. She looked like a guy with a heavy gay accent and a short brown wig ( Lol of course you encountered that religiousness on your way to Texas Those anti-marijuana billboards on the highway lol Yeah but overall I feel like NM has no redeeming qualities that trump those of Tucson That's so awesome!!!! Can you take pictures of it? What kinda stuff is on the menu? I saw your NM snapchat story of the river. I wasn't aware it was so lush by the highway. Are you still feeling sick today? Also I thought your dad packed food lol. What happened to that? I was in and out of sleep from about  AM, lying to myself that I could peacefully continue Were you nice to her Jk I know you were. But did you interact? No I agree %. Literally that river was the first and only pretty place in NM that I saw. Given, I was just along the highway, but still Not sick today. Yesterday it was like stomachache, headache, general soreness. Not strong at all, but just irritating Lol he packed snacks Not whole meals so like We have bread and tomatoes and grapes and plums and bananas And tuna That's all as far as I could tel Tell 
It just was a regular diner on the inside, so all I have is this. Unfortunately I got your message right after we left. I feel that we have now entered the south. They said y'all, and had sweet tea, and OOOOEEEE( /attachment.JPG()/att achment.JPG()/att achment.JPG The  panorama was out in front  of the diner but y ou can't see the f ront of the diner in the 
 pic Bad pic of me  I didn't check ou  t the full menu but I had pie, chocolate peanut butter and it was good. They had all sorts of weird (but not hipster) types. Like coconut pineapple or Elvis (chocolate, peanut butter, and banana) Sweet tea was a positive experience I don't think I had the super saturated stuff. It was sweet but not that swe Awww your mom wears feanny packs It was funny because I was helping her at the jewetlry counter and then my gay coworker told me to leave and that 
 he would take over the counter?? It was really weird. Then they started flirting with each other. My mom has not stopped talking about you all morning.  You said he was Jewish, right?  What did you get him for his goodbye gift?  *me blowing my nose* don't cry it's okay Why did he chose that Ivy League over others? After my flight last week I was sore, especially in my core. It felt like I worked out my muscles though. Is that how you felt? Or was it the sore feelin from sitting for too long? Lol I've never had real sweet tea before, unless you count McDonald's.  How'd you even find that cafe?! It literally looks like it's in the middle of bumfuck nowhere Elvis lol You probably did make it to the south Be prepared! Yesterday my manager was like you'd rather go to DC than work at savers....? Wow. Where is DC? What's Maryland? What's the northeast? Don't you mean the northwest? Boy, has the public education system failed some people Oh my god I really am somewhat of an elitist()/attachment.PNG Spea k of the devil  Did you know Elvis' favorite snack was toast  with peanut butter and banana on it? That's probably why I re  ad that in some book for boys when I was a kid and eating that made me feel cool I think my mom found it on tripadvisor but it's the midpoint on Route , so that's cool. Like  miles from both LA and Chicago Lol did boy get her number I really don't understand the whole gay guy and mildly passable trans woman thing I was about to say that even in early stages I would not have dated a lesbian, but then I remembered. To be fair, she had long hair and said she was bi.  Seems she is trying to help you out though ) I felt stomach bad before I got in the car, but the soreness you are talking about was definitely true at the end 
 too! I feel it is a southern rite of passage I think not knowing cardinal directions is a fair thing to be elitist about What's Maryland I actually did know the Elvis thing haha, and I did the same thing as a kid It's funny that the name is innovative student. Nothing about a high ACT score is innovative? I actually really like Big Freedia...  I was watching some of her videos; and it was the same thing with black girls wall twerking EVERYWHERE in public They have a thing here where if you can finish a . pound steak you get it free That sounds hellish I chatted with Elizabeth last night, she was very sad about not having anyone close there to talk to. It was heartbreak When I think of Texasi I assume closer to L.A., but I looked at the map to see Adriann and it's pretty smack dab in the middle.  I didn't even knog
w gay and trans together was a thing. Although I'm sure the people you've done things with in the past now identify as more lesbian leaning. Like Sophia. Is it because of the male/tough looking female thing? Isn't that kinda offensive? I had a dream you changed your name and added a profile picture and we celebrated that occasion lol The boy did not get her number though. They were literally at the savers jewelry counter for  minutes. It's not some huge ass department store. Stupid question is sweet tea just sweetened with sugar? Or is it a certain tea that's sweet on its own  Lol I know. I score high on the ACT and they expect me to improve the Hubble telescope or something  Did you just call big freedia her? If big Freedia is a gay boy what does that say about southern attitudes towards homosexuality I've been thinking about that 
That sounds like asking for a heart attack. That's so disgusting. I imagine plump white men with rosacea and sweat beads rolling down their foreheads as they ravenously tear into the meet and shake their heads side to side.   When I read that text my heart dropped. 
It's depressing how your education restricts you in a way, socially. The people who didn't do as well or who don't have the money stay at the UA and strengthen their friendships. They will most likely stay in Tucson their entire lives and maintain contact with their high school friends. 
On the other hand, you, valedictorians, and other rich people from basis are going away. You will see your high school friends maybe  times a year during the school year. You will spend a lot of the summer of us. Hopefully we don't bore you (compared to your mind expanding Ivy League friends) and we don't become vague memories 
One thing people tend to neglect though is the feeling of leaving. On social media all the students flocking towards their new campus away from home seem liberated. These personal statements from both you and Elizabeth deeply sadden me. Zayna at  Sergio what happened with Aimee  My mom told me I'm lucky to have a phone because when her UA boyfriend moved to Dubai they could only write each other and know they would meet in a matter of months. The moment you left was the moment I couldn't wait to see you again. This is ridiculous http//www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive///the-paradox-of-baby-names//?utm_source=SFFB()/attachment.JPG I c  u Reading the article lol I love our memes I am really g lad to have had a really short haircut so recently. I feel tha  t it has greatly improved my experience in the South.  You know, I feel like I have lost my grip on capitalization rules. I gave so many fucks as a kid.  That's a big thing though-- (sane) people share the great moments on fb. You never see their struggles. ()/attachment.JPG Pano rama Yeah it is pretty offensive, that's the thing. At this p oint, I would be very hurt if someone was interested in me and 
 their professed identity did not include being attracted to men  Texas houses are brick and cute I won't add a profile pic but I will change the name. Maybe tonight I love my church yard signs Yes it is with sugar, loads of haha Idk about you but I have been working on the Hubble since age ... What, you're only working on the international space station, then? In the podcast Freedia said she doesn't mind which pronouns, but most people use she, and so the host did. She identifies as male though  Well, she said she was really really bullied And that all of her boyfriends up until the current one were closeted (on the down low) But her family accepted her so she is out She got respect over time from being a tough bitch There was a video of her walking around New Orleans and al these tough looking guys are like shit man it's Freedia!!! I'm assuming you didn't answer her? Lol first time on the highway I have seen a minimum speed  Speed limit , Minimum ) Holy shit months for letters And the whole naming thing recently is very silly I'm a traditionalist in that sense, I would have gone with like James and William I like the recently popular female names I have been fantasizing about laying with you, outside of just while I am falling asl You know, a lot of peeople in the south haven't had exposure to gay people so they aeren't sure who is and isn't. In D.C., a girl from rural Floridp a said I seemed very straight and she had no idea. She said I wasn't like a guy in her drama class who wanted to get manicures all the time, lol, and of course this guy bothered her.  Capitalization of minorities as a young child?! Lol jk. I know what you mean. If it weren't for autocorrect I wouldn't be capitalizing lol. It's too much work. What a beautiful contrast!!! Did you do that on purpose in your panorama? That's fucking beautiful It's like man vs. nature You should submit that somewhere All that divides them is that sole tree Then why is it that you would be willing to fuck a straight guy? What if he wants you to put a bag over your head or wear a wig and shave or something Can you send a pic of a Texas home? Any Trump lawn signs yet? I can't believe the I love my church lol. Even my grandpa wouldn't do that. Although on Halloween he does put a sign that he doesn't believe in pagan holidays and he says not to come to the door  At  I actually had a social life lol What's the name of this podcast? I NEED to listen to it. No I did not answer her and I do not intend on doing so. When they ask me I'm going to say I don't want to talk about it. Lol that's so funny. Your dad must be upset there's a minimum speed P I wonder why they have that though. Too many grandmas fucking over everyone's day. James and William and Phillip and Charles and Edward are such sexy names to me now They scream success Lol you gonna come home for Labor Day? Jk What holiday do you plan on coming home for? *holidays I imagine this bittersweet reunion with intense eye contact, similar to when you came back after that month when you got surgery  When I was in Maryland I kept wishing you were with me I can not imagine separation in a time without Internet Yes those are the EXACT names I like. Edward especially.  You art-minded fuck. It just happened, but I see what you're talking about. Especially given the science monument See it's different dating vs fucking I feel it's legitimate for anyone to experiment  But if we were dating I would expect him to call himself bi I would not put a bag over my head or wear a wig, I have more self respect than that Unless it was like Leonardo dicaprio, lol. Bow down()/attachment.jpeg I d idn't take this picture but this is the idea I wasn't looking
 hard, but I didn't see any trump signs It's on Death, Sex, a  nd Money and the episode is In New Orleans Big Freedia Bounces Back Coming home for winter break and then MAAAAYYYYBE spring (probably not) and then summer. On the upside, my winter break is like  -   What did I say to you at winter formal? It's actually kind of romantic, the idea of maintaining a relationship via letters written with fountain pens under candle light Do the SUPER femme gays bother you at all? You are torturing me with these pics I have jerked in like a day and it's already bottling up I won't be able to for like probably at least a week So nice tho Whenever you need helup you just ask me and I'll be there What is the science monumgent for? I haven't* It's for the discovery of heli Art-mh inded fuck was cuute and made me laugh lol It has an atom with two protons mand two neutrons Because Amarillo is like the main helium pro  ducer And also holds the national helium rese Yeah, you're right. Ir was devastated when Shawn said that he liked girls more. Idk,v he said he was bi but I felt like it undermined everything. e That house is too cute to be true I would expect a hospitable Christian family, with a mom who sets tea and crackers for her friends and they all watch nature programs together They also use the word program to refer to the television shows 
That's depressing. I also find that very romantic. I feel incredibly selfish because my ideal situation for us is that we have sexual freedom but we stay emotionally committed to each other, but I feel bad because this is your experience and stuff I felt that he would go back and forth whenever he wanted to leave someone in order to make it seem like it was out of his control Because in like th grade I was the same w It's sad that you tolad me that the day before you left because like I said, things yfinally felt very complete Do you think you could date a b. i guy? Does it give you peace that I'm gay? Lol nature programs? As if. This is Tex Super femme gays makea me uncomfortable when they're in my presence and (this is goisng to sound awful) I can't even imagine them being sexy Like . I can not imagine having sex with a guy like that LOL the  story cross I can't even believe that Mr. Mayor, what would improve our city? 
I want to think more about the sexual freedom/emotional commitment. I don't know that we could do that without jealousy and issues arising from that. I want to be great friends with you for sure, but I feel like sexual freedom, with our personalities in mind, would conflict with commitment. I assure you though that this isn't like last summer at all, I am trying to figure out what will be most productive and least conducive to hurting one another. Let's keep the dialogue open.  It is very important to me that we stay close.  I know! I don't get how those boys get so much sex. Like on one hand they are all dainty and clean, and on the other hand they get fucked in the ass by big men on the regular?? Lol it was actually just a church in the middle of nowhere What would improve our church and bring us closer to God? How 'bout a real big motherfucking cross To reach up to God I really can't imagine sex with a limp-wristed ho eit He pulled the same shhit with Reyna where he was like actually, I like guys more aend we had an ex-convention lol.  I could date a bi guy again r as long as he wasn't an insensitive asshole about it and didn't say shit like that.  Lol the show would be a redneck shooting cows Yes! I remember that. That's what I'm talking about  Mostly because I'm a bottom though, maybe if I topped I could imagine fucking a femme Reality TV  A feeling I developedl that I wasn't sure about before is how I feel about sex and oother people. Currently, and I think it will be like this for al
 long time, I really don't feel comfortable and can't even think about having sex with other people. I know that first times are silly sometimes, but it's actually a very personal thing for me. In a way it wasn't before If you were to have sex with other people.. Idk. This is difficult to provide solutions forS I love the idea of resuming things when you come back It could be a power and dominance thing like with jay, except in the gay community  Just because they're dainty they get attention I would hate to hear their super high pitched shrieks Lol yeah I rarely ever got tired while rubbing you off. That shit gave me energy. Maybe that's why they have southern accents. It's their punishment for attempting to reach God, like the tower of Babylon If God was real they wouldn't pull that shit I can't believe you stayed with me while I was really religious Even as a top I can't imagine fucking a femme Omg I'm thinking of Duck Dynasty. Also just so you know whenever you want to you can always call me and Skype me What did you think of the fraternity signs I agree with the idea of getting together when in town. Let's reevaluate our thoughts in a couple weeks when emotions are running as high.  Aren't* Wait, where do you draw the line for a femme? Like is there anyone we know who you would consider a femme Lol it took me a second to make the rubbing off and limp wrist connection I know you and your phases. I doesn't faze me It I will keep that in mind ) Lol those signs Were funny but also pretty objectifying I am so wet Actually they were pretty disgusti Yesterday at work I wnas wearing a penguin costume (full body suit) and Amaris walkegd into the store and saw me and it was all very awkward It  's kind of funny that between us you are a twink top and I'm an otter bottom What It's not even  Do you wear them every day now? How is  Aramis sorry Mock trhial kid Ohh Okay, yeah that soundhs great. This was basede off of one conversation where we talkehd about the possibilit? y of keeping ourselves single for each oh ther, so we could resume when you came back. While there is nobody here I would even consider that with, I feel like that could change for you. I imagine femme as a guy with long dyed bangs and super thin lol idk Nobody we know. Do you? I'm at work now ( I'll text you on my breaks and maybe call you, but please send pics and your thoughts I love hearing from you as much as possible Ohhhh, see I was thinking of on of the types that wears pink jeans and  inch v-necks and goes to pride in a jock strap. Also super thin In Oklahoma now! It's actually decently green I'm pretty sure I have met a few in my day but I can't recall at the moment I saw one in LA I don't really understand the full time drag queens who aren't trans )()/attachment.PNG Lol  buzzfeed bleeps nigga but not f Oh yeah, that descripution is
 accurate as well. Like guys in crop tops and short shocrts an  d heels kinda deal. I have never accepted the existencek
 of Oklahoma as a state because it's neglected so much There was that bombing That's all anyone knows lol I've seen many downtown. I think of Priscilla characters as femme Lol one is actually more derogatory and charged than the other  The ground in OK is red as f What's up now? What ucity in Oklahoma Ooooh pics!!! Like red dirt? Also we wenct to a restaurant that was recommended and it was in this nastk y ass hotel But the food was decent and cheap Lots of scary looking creepy ass obese and old truckers  When I can get o You know every time In text you from work I am hiding in the bathroom It is serieously very very red d There's literally notihing for me to do!
 and they acknowledge it Elk city I'll brelieve it when  I see it lol OK YES that is what I think ot f as femme. The OPriscilla types. They don't have to be wearing women's clothesK
 constantly, just have the strong accent and act all loud Hahaha I figured you had break or were allowed to if you weren't doing shit The idea of being at work and being expected not to go on your phone despite having nothing to do bothers me Not managing to take a good pic so I found a representative one through google images()/attachment. Hey bae What's up wiJth you? Lol who recommended that? What did you
 guys eat thereP? I don't even consider motel restaurants real 
 restaurants  AG cting all loud and flamboyant is KEY They have their phrases they overuse and scream whenever they get a chance  lol it turns out so many other people here want to quit too. I'm gonna write my resignation letter tonight and bring it in after school. 
I hate all of these rules and regulations. It literally doesn't give the company a bad name. If i saw some employee on their phone I wouldn't care. It's business. It's normal. It's probably important, and if it's not then who gives a fuck. Today an employee ran out yelling on the phone, THEY FIRED ME BECAUSE THEY SAID I DIDNT FIT He's this fat white trash guy who came to savers after quitting McDonald's  That looks like something you could just lie in That dirt I'm more stable today but I feel nauseous because I haven't eaten anything and I'm running all over the place There's also red dirt in the Grand Canyon()/attachment.jpeg Cap tured by yours truly 💋 Maybe in lieu of writing letters unde r a candle light I can wait a week and a half before replying   to your texts hahahah It's going to be strange not texting you every day. Or even talking, Have you driven at all during the trip? More than a woman is playing on the savers speakers()/attachment.JPG()/att achment.JPG Cong ress's two Native American members are repub licans from Oklaho ma Native Americans Well I took a nap   And woke up in Okla  homa City And it feels like Marana. The city just looks republican Literally every county in Oklahoma has voted republican for the last three presidential elections  It was recommended by the lady at the Oklahoma welcome center at a rest stop lol Also yelp Lol you are gonna write a letter? Who else wants to quit? So have you decided to try to find another job? That's not a classy thing to do Mr. white trash mcdonald It's weirder here because it's mostly all grassy, but then in the cleared areas for farms it's like BAM Christmas colors What kind of music do they normally play there I have not driven an inch My dad would NEVER let me drive his car hell no http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCmZVFdOSo http//m.youtube.com/watch?v=ISpjf_FfM  Crazy Freedia twerking as well as hilarious white peop Hey Again lol lol tlhey're only successful because they got the affirmative actione to get into a good college and then identified as white after 
 they were admitted That's how sneaky the politicians be Ew so you mean like communities that all look the same Oklahoma welcome center lol. I have two stories to tell you about work But should I call you later or tell you about them now? We could skype this week You have to write a letter if you want to leave in good standing. It's lame as fuck. I probably won't find another job until  when I actually have time. I already have ~$+ from savers which is great for me Christmas colors? Like green and red? Sometimes I consider white and blue icy Christmas colors They play everything. Country, Motown, oldies, etc. it's like they switch stations every song I'm sorry but would you mind telling me the names of the videos because YouTube is being a dumb bitch You're almost already halfway across the U.S.!! That's crazy my lunch ends in  min btw Ok I'll tell you the stories I'll be out of the car in about an hour So I can call then How long is your lunch 
 motherfucking minute?s Lol one went to community college Didn't check where th?e other w That's how long it taekes me to get across the stor? e LOL the other one went to Gnrinnell and became a republican (and then went to graduate scht ool at Yale) And finally got a Ph.D. In British History at U of Oklahoma Yes and families with young kids and pregnant bellies. And bass pro shops. And shit head kids smoking and driving motorcycles loudly and spitting I wasn't aware that most savers workers were capable of composing letters Lol yes red and green. Though I agree that they aren't all that associated these days Not gonna spend as much $ with us not constantly going out Yep, almost! But not halfway through the trip-- it's gonna be six days and this is only day .

 sounds just like a savers store! Working here is so different. My memories of us coming after Joseph's party to shop together are not tainted with shitty managers and customers *are now tainted My back and legs ache because I'm standing up all day I like spending money with you (()/attachment.jpeg Fou nd this gem in the store Has anyone gotten annoyed yet on thi s trip? Whenever I go on road trips someone cries or gets rea  lly upset or throws up or gets a nosebleed lol Is driving to campus a tradition for people who live far away or what? Is it a thing not exclusive to class? Have you cried today I've been pretty okay. Only two/three times. I get so stupid What're you gonna do when you get off? Sorry I was getting into the hotel I will moan when I get off I would hate doing a job that requires standing so much Do you wear good shoes? Mm some short annoyances but nothing that didn't resolve within a minute, so not really Which is surprising because I usually end up super pissed at some point Lol the basis shirt  We heard it was a tradition  But I don't know anything about it  I welled up a bit but no other than that. I don't really have any alone time so it would be very inconvenient Do you cry at work? What happens if you cry at w That's alright! Is ito actually a hotel or are you staying somewhere shady? Which cirty are you in tonight? Did you reach Tulsa? I wear my conversk e lol, so not really I can cry at work because I'm alone most of the time. I have welled up in front of customers while at the register and I've cried during my breaks or lunch, but I'm always alone I cried in the bathroom once I feel like the people here wouldn't really care because we all go through our own shit How much decor did you pack for your dorm Do Elizabeth and jay still talk often? Also you're so lucky you don't have to do work study. Could you potentially work in a lab or something? We did reach Tulsa! It's a best western again. My dad prefers it because he is close to getting gold member status or something that gives him free upgrades So he wants more points Otherwise we would probably be at a Sheraton or holiday inn So it's not shady, but also not particularly nice By alone you mean the only one in that part of the store? I brought your poster and my Klimt poster and a pillow with your pillow case And then like I have a like oaxacan tortoise figurine And a small brass pitcher to hold pencils Just a few small trinkets I think they do still talk quite a bit Yeah I could do that if I wanted, but I probably won't this semester. I'm trying to ease in Jay said he told her he was going to stop calling her babe, and that she was welcome and encouraged to sleep around, though he won't for a wh It was so nasty becauise last night I was crying into my burrito B I am so sorryl I am going to sleep 🌚 Tired AF Feel free to send any and e everything tho No that's alright I'mu still gonna text you haha ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Have a great night and Ig'm glad you're safe so far!! 🐢 Good night my love , Auh gust Gold member sounds pr etty legit. Maybe they're gonna claim a free room on their way, back or something. Hopefully your hotel has good food and bre  akfast so you don't have to suffer through shit hahah.  I'm glad you made it to Tulsa! You should read about the race riots, they're awful. I wrote a paper on them for seminar last year.  By alone I mean in the part of a store or facing away from other people when I'm not. I couldn't even drive home. I had to pull over because I kept crying. I hope it doesn't sound too pathetic but the realizations are too painful / After seeing your bedding I'm a little worried as to how all of these colors/patterns are going to come together I guess inconsistency is the latest, hm? That's probably best. I've realized working crazy hours isn't ideal for me during school. I know for a fact that you'd hate it hahah YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN THAT SNAP OH MU GOD I forgot what an angel you are Did you know Wes Craven died? ( what a tragedy, losing geniuses Anyway I'll talk to you tomorrow and I look forward to hearing about everything 🌚 I love you I will tag you in some Instagram stuff Here's from after a hike we promised to not see a snake and it once jinxed a nature walk but when the same two people tacitly find love how will the jinxes play out? http//www.ted.com/talks/christopher_ryan_are_we_designed_to_be_sexual_omnivores Also I listened to the Big Freedia podcast and my initial thoughts were I can't believe Jesus inspired bounce music lol Lol saskia posts a bunch of videos of her and Shawn and Gil and the bunch of seniors living together, and all they do is drink and smoke weed and play video games and do homework Race riots in Tulsa? It doesn't sound pathetic at all Lol so My sheets are blue and white small stripes, and I have a pillow that is that same pattern  And then I have like a navy blue pillow But it is the latest I'm a visionary Yes! I saw about him. Did you hear about Mt. McKinley being renamed Denali by Obama? And that John Boehner called it a disgrace Because Ohioans had named in McKinley because he was a presidential nominee at the time from Ohio, and Boehner represents Ohio I saw the Instagram stuff! It was so good Loving the tortoise And sylvester's bulge And Miley's rainbow cumshot Also I made hundreds on the stocks this week I'm glad they do homework And a bit surprised I hope it doesn't play out like the kids last year who dropped out Will listen to the Ted in a bit Your emoji drawing was brillia Yes sir https//en.m.wnikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot How big are the brown dormst? I heard about it being renamed but what's the controversy?   Is it discrediting the discoverer?  I didn't look into it much The news my family puts on in the morning only talks about who's climbing what mountain and which lady left her child in a shopping cart and the new dog the Johnston family adopted What makes me upset is that if my mom was knowledgable about the stock market then I, too, could be making hundreds off of it Oh I saw the explanation of the mountain renaming after I sent  Lol I think Gil would be the only one to stay in school Have a great day!! Send some pics, stretch your muscles, penetrate yourself with a cucumber 😘 Also send me your stock advice and experience because I may put $ of my paycheck to that lissa's parents live off of stocks lol I had never heard if that! That's really awful.  Mine is  square feet which is considered pretty big, though on my floor it's one of the smallest.  Most are decent sized, I think. Tufts one was tiny The one at brown I stayed in was damn big The brown dorm I'm in, for comparison, is slightly smaller than my current room, but the  includes the closets No it's discrediting President McKinley, and Boehner is mad cos ) McKinley is a Republican ) McKinley is from Ohio ) everything Obama does must become a controversy ) McKinley was assassinated My parents' morning news is all Donald trump I read it in USA today Whoops about the Boehner explanation . Tulsa is actually like really nice Lol and hopefully Shawn Might send some pics, probably sans cucumber Lol my advice is have fun you are young  All these churches and old skyscrapers()/attachment.JPG()/att achment.JPG Not  flattering photos Lots of infrastructure an d old shit()/attac hment.JPG()/att achment.JPG()/att achment.J  PG()/att achment.jp  eg()/at tachment .j hey I t’s fun ny that pyou said  I’m young because  we ar  e literally th e sa  me age.  e Well   yeah but like That  's all your money M  y mom can invest g for me and I still have spending money But I see the humor()/attachment.JPG()/att achment.JPG Foun d at Kum and Go and QuikTrip competitor/cl one Made it into  Joplin, MO, home of hella flooding I meant

 clothes and obese people and meth addicts   and trailers  But   also pretty houses Haven't seen any pretty people in a long t Wow I sent you a pictiure in the morning fuck yo  W Haven't seen any prethty pemople Haha I meant in person HIV prevalence among blaack me en who have sex with men approaches % And % of those are t unaware they are infected Despite the fact that there are way more whites, there are slightly more blacks gay infected every year than white gays But it's just because at this point it is ingrained in the community Same rate of testing, rate of condom use, less sex partners Do the tumblr SJWs like Mil Zayna showed me pictueres of her grandfather meeting with the president of Hamas  Fyuck, your dorm is pretty big then because I assume the closets?
 aren't that big. All those churches and 'skyscrapers' make me uncomfortable. They seem out of place in the city. What defines hickish lol Those forests are rather pretty though. Thank you for that. Yeah, when I read the HIV thing I assumed it was a result of the lack of education and condom use among the population Oh, with the same rate I keep reading your messages after I send things and then I sound stupid lol Well then that's just really sad ( how terrible 
It's weird because there's a divide in tumblr for Miley support. With the recent Nicki Minaj scandal her support is kinda low, and people assume Miley is just an attention seeker. She released a new album yesterday and it was... interesting As I was typing this the radio just held a poll for Miley vs. Nicki LOL how was your day today? Any interesting stories? Why do you only put nature/places snapchats on your story lol Kanye west announced he is running for president They gay boy at work actually has vitiligo. Is she proud of that? Did she ask you again about what she said? Yes the closets are not large Some dorms are up to like ... Hickish is like, I'm afraid of them pulling a gun if I go on their property My day was pretty cool, nothing particularly interesting.  I feel that those are the things most interesting to widely share Is it obvious, his vitiligo? The sad thing is that I would almost vote for him given the shitty fi My grandpa on the mouentain name change who and what is Denali!!!! I went to McKinlley elementary school. this is such a wretched world. I feel bad d for the kids growing up. I gave her a suspicious look and she didn't even look up at me and continued scrolling through her pictures  She did and I said that it's not what she wants to hear and it's inappropriate for her to ask me, and then she said Well I hope for your sake that you did the right thing for yourself Oh lol well yes, that is pretty hickish because he'sxican and lighter than me it's not too opposing, but it is kinda obvious  Anyway I had a kinda shitty day and I feel like so many things are falling apart but it's okay I'm pretty sure if a republican made the name change he wouldn't give a f I feel like an idiot uin game theory, I miss you terribly, I got rejected from Amhercst fly in and they replied with a shitty letter compared to Nak thaniel's, I don't want to audition for the musical because I can't even sing, I want to quit my life-consuming job. Amherst didn't even offer me an application fee waiver They did for Nathaniel though I feel like so many things are weighing me down and I feel like especially now my life is unfair I don't even know what to do, but I will start with quitting the job I feel like major shit right now To be fair you did the right thing for yourself, as she said They didn't send you and Nate the same letter? Sergio I'm so sorry ( It sounds like an awful Day Did you call Carlet I am actually so devaostated that I can't call you so we can get coffee or somethingn Like you have no idea Did something happen in drama?  (? I'll be at the hotel in like an h And you're enjoying yoour road trip and seeing the world and I'm trapped here Youu know, you just need to get through this year. You knew it war s gonna be a hard path, an uphill battle. You can't base your self-worth on these decisions that are based on who you were years ago They are rejecting freshman you, not current you It will work out, you just need to keep your head up! We both knew Amherst was a long shot, but next year it won't be a long shot as a transfer!! That I'm here and you're there is, luckily for you, just a matter of time, that I skipped a grade a decade ago. You are gonna get out of Tucson and explore the world, it's just a matter of time And in the meantime, you have cool people, cool places. You know what's up in Tucson, you can grab midnight coffee and art house movi They rejected both ofe us but Nathaniel got a letter that said you have demonstratesd strong academic success over your four years, we would love . to consider your application later. Here's a fee waiver and mine was If you believe that Amherst is a good match for you, we would love to review your application for admission in the fall. I'm supposed to call Carleton tomorrow Nothing happened in drama but I am not very confident in my abilities Thank you, I'm sorry for being like this this week. It's been difficult. I honestly feel like I am draining a lot of your energy by saying all of this negative sad stuff Ughhhhhh Anyway, how are you doing What's the latest with your trip now? Where are you staying tonight and what sights and restaurants did you stop at? are your parents peeved at anything yet? Good luck with your call, let me know how it goes as soon as you get off the line You at least had the courage to audition! I know I never did, despite wanting to. And I'm sure that's not true. Plus anyway, you have just started, you aren't expected to be the best right away. Enjoy the path  You aren't, I am glad to hear you out and support you  
We are staying in Northwest St. Louis in some suburb, at a Holiday Inn, which I'm happy about. It's better than Best Western. At first I suggested a Westin or an Omni Hotel, but my dad wanted a place with complimentary breakfast.  We drove through Mark Twain National Forest and it was fucking beautiful But it was homogenous  Really you can see it all within a few minutes Today... I went to Walmart lol Didn't eat out  🌺()/attachment.JPG This
 was in a nicer neighborhood in Tulsa They often don't have f ences around the houses And even just OK neighborhoods have s  mall lies We visited university of Tulsa but There wasn't much to see The building were mostly uninspired  
My dad got angry at the long detour but he got over it, he just likes to be nudnik as we say in Hebrew. Don't know what the translation is really, but it's kind of like annoyingly combative but in a light and silly way What are you doing tonight In the coming days I plan on Trying burgers at a White Castle and Steak n Sh I didn't even know Weastin was an international hotel chain!!! I really have not beekn anywhere lol I didn't either I just saw it on hotels. e That sounds so beauticful, the Mark Twain forest. You can actually drive through it oor did you pass it?? You took pics, right? Lol I saw your cucm umber snap at Walmart. Are those walmarts trashy too like ours? That 'nicer' neighborhood seems like it would be unsafe at night, idk. Life in those areas seems so fucking unappealing. Even the universities. It's like the further east and south you go the less people care about aesthetic  Minus the few big cities I can understand the feeling lol but I can't think of a word to describe that combativeness   I tried White Castle in Indiana and I remember getting frustrated because I was still hungry  Tonight I am doing my homework lol and I am also going to a scout meeting for a few minutes to drop something off What about you? Did you 🌺 today? I would love to skype you but I don't want you feeling uncomfortable with your parents around Small lakes* It was supposed to say small lakes There were no shoulders so we couldn't stop So I took some video Which isn't that great, but I'll send once I get to wifi Their walmarts are not trashy compared to what surrounds it. They seem comparatively nicer. And I think they might actually be nicer, because it's not just the shitty people that go to Walmart It was actually pretty close to the interior of the city, and looked damn safe. Bad photo. Also houses there are affordable AF I disagree! I think the South and the old shit there is incredibly aesthetic  Given, the new construction often sucks. The houses are cute, but lots of buildings are just metal warehouses, especially churches I won't argue that life in the South seems unappealing  I like St. Louis though It seems really cool When are you finishing scouts? What homework? I have not touched myself in the slightest I could skype you from the lobby tonight All the rural people I saw were ugly Just like fundamentally unattractive  Some looked inbr Oh lol, well small laekes are nice, yes. It all looks very quaint.  Riiiiighhhhtt. dWalmart is a huge deal over there. My southern friends had nev  er stepped foot in a Safeway. They only knew Walmart and Kroger.()/attachment.jpeg Thi s photo bothers me. Everything is uneven and looks like each b uilding belongs in its own section. I can't possibly imagine a  ll of that coming together to one city. I was imagining Skype sex too but lobby is okay. Lol that's so sad. What does ugly mean in southern standards? Teeth and nose? I wonder when it will start to get more attractive.()/attachment.JPG I
 think it's a cool trait to consume hot foods Like if someone
 can't take any heat they might be lame I think the panorama   changes the proportions and makes it look more uneven than it is. That said, it's an awkward place that is just a bit out of downtown  That maybe could happen in the bathtub? I'll take a bath, run the water, we can chat while it runs? Over FaceTime Idk like So many fat and disproportionate and just like gross faces And di Ok! Let me know when,r preferably in  minutes-ish And no makeup Or bad makeup tBut especially some have like fucked up jaws But also teeth y Let me know when you can do it How do you feel sexually right  How late will you be nup tonight?

Idk I can stay up till whenever Within reason Won't sw tay up for more than like another hour and a h Can we talk on the phaone first and then do that? Is that a plan?

 MEN But ftm is ok? That's kinda bitchy To be fair she seems ok with trans women It just seems like she doesn't want straight boys, which is more fair by far than saying Cis women and trans  Someone on the altermnative side lol Someone willing to get their feet wet Speakeing of getting wet What's up with you? Heading to the shon wer now I'm gonna be relatively quiet in speaking  Ok and also while we brecognize that maintaining intimacy is difficult with distancet Do you still feel attracted to me emotionally and stuff?

 like are you speaking from the standpoint where you have witnessed feelings decimate through distance? Sergio yes Because that's where !I was coming from Lol yeah I'm gonna be quiet too I don't! think I will be able to maintain what I felt that night, or h! ow we felt then, together But I will not stop caring for you Or about  Everything about thaty night was soooo perfect I will always long to come home aond see you, and hang out with  From the way you moanyed your u feelings to me to having my arm around you during the omovie Like it all replays so beautifully in my head I wonu 't be speaking b ecause it's too loud But I can look at you lol Ok same C an't lip read Almost at  Oh lol I said graciasa and I love y) ou and that was great And you are sexy You tloo okg Omg Lovin t That was so much fun I agree I hatl e that I'm in the bath though cos it's hard afor me to jerk  Did you jerk though? o( Oh yeah I was wondert ing about that I did yeah but it's fmore difficult But seriously you looked so good And sw Whenf

I wisho it lasted longer or we moved to the back and you got to lie dl own I wish we had a bed I think about if we had a room to ourselves To watch movies And read And cook And eat And then playful gestures turn into more And we go to this bed, like the bed in Annie hall And you take me any time day or night But especially day with light coming in the window and a light breeze Or do you mean the last t I imagined living togiether and while you were working I come into your office/worksmpace and start massaging your shoulders and then one thing leae ds to another Because the last time, I wish we had a bed too,  Or if we had a pool wle could have done the pool sex And I thought it was over qouickly Hones Yes, I was talking abtout the last time and howl
 it ended too fast I feel that inl the car, going multiple times is not as enjoyable for me, becy ause it's a long time to be in an increasingly sweaty car, pounded against a door I love the first time, but the considerations of reality set in on the second Yes omg pool sex I remember we were swimming with Reyna and l I feel terrible everyi time we have car sex because I am literally dripping sweat onkto you We weren't fucking but I could feel your cock on mee H Lol we were at the beaginning stages when she left to get a towel Omg yes the ofrfice sounds h And we could've takeno early morning hikes or nd eighborhood walks together Maybe whetn you come back for the summer we can rent a little apartment   for a month Or do something spontaneous  That would be fun!

I mean on the highw Lol did anyone comment ?a Parents? Whap t did you see? Farm land? That's how I've always i  maygined most of it LOL Omg I have a story I'll tell it in a  H. ahah okay. Well I justs woke up so you tell your story and I'll do my thang All is goode What's your thang Anyway I didn't see much, from the highway c it just looked like it had some empty strip malls and off brand stores But  When we were driving through some suburban farm land My dad jokingly asked is this ferguson??@ 
And I said something like if it was, they would be even angrier, as it would be mocking their slave heritage anyway that wasn't funny, but it is funny that you, after we had that conversation in the car, thought that ferguson was farm land It's not farm land lol Welcome to Illinois! Don't bootleg cigarettes! First  signs of Illin Lol that's only becauseo of This American Life. On the news it showed store shops being broiken and city stuff, but for some reason I assume that each city hass
 farm land on its outskirt. Like because Tucson has so much dry land surrounding it I assume every city is like that. Kinda how there's LA and then Bakersfield and other small, shitty CA farm land Isn't that a safe assumption to make? I say yes I didn't think ferguson was that big anyway Lol but I think it's funny that your dad and I assumed the same thing. What gave it away? How did you know it was ferguson? Lol but it's an inner St. Louis suburb so like South Tucson doesn't have farms But that's f Lol I wonder how old thaat sign is. Is bootlegging substances even a thing anymore? I know imoonshine Strictly speaking, Tucson doesn't have farms, Marana r does Nah it's not big at  And obviously I don't maean drugs Also Illinois isn't hick town anymore, so you're safe folr now No he was joking lol I saw on a map. There was no sign ol n the highway for Ferguson, only a billboard for the ferguson streetfest (lol) I know, AND ITS SO PRETTY No it's totally a thing Because here we go from Republican land of low tax to Democrat land So Missouri has lowish taxes on cigarettes  And Illinois taxes suck So people smuggle em Isn't it crazy to think  that there are still riots going on in ferguson to this day A staite of emergency was recently declared on August th No, south Tucson n doesn't have farms but there certainly is a lot of empty land. I was mainly talking about Vail, Sahuarita, and Marana though. Right right but like ferguson is an inner suburb like south Tuc lol there is, however, sthe Tucson village farm!! Jk Idk if they have empty land in feorguson , didn't go check ( I see your point tho Ahhhh... I shavedn
 and Iu have no idea what I was waiting so long for. I feel fresh as fuck.g How have you been keeping up with the razor? Lol ferguson streeth
 fest! Brutality! Molotov cocktails! And more! dia crews! Oh that makes sense. What a strange job that must be, smuggling in tobacco across the border. Do they check you? I assume not I haven't shaved in almost four days and I feel like a m I see. That makes more esense then. I assumed ferguson was pretty big Pic!$!$ I reallys need to shave every other day or every day to maintain a clean loos k and feel no there's nothing at the border, no checkpoint, just a sign Sorry b maybe soon No place to s Awww, I'm sorry! Hopefutlly you can shave tonight when you shower or you find the time befoore you arrive.  Where are you headed in Illinois? Have you ever bp een to Chicago? Do you know why there's a border check for California then? Is it only for major states?()/attachment.JPG Do you
 know the difference between hot and spicy Yes, sorry, I fucked
 it up yesterd Fucked what up? Lola Lol I might be over it by 
 night. I'd like to do the stubble thingy at college I have never been in Chicago, except the airport. You?  We are just driving through Illinois and Indiana to get to Columbus Ohio I have no idea why they have on for CA. I think it may primarily be for immigration purposes? To  catch potential illegals coming from southern AZ into CA I said that I thought it was cool to eat hot food When I meant spicy f Omg nooo I didn't mean oit like that ( that sounds like such a dick thing to say. I was genouinely asking the question because my mom uses them interchangeablyd
 all the time. But I was a bit confused yesterday when you said that because I thought you admired the guys who can eat steak straight from the grill  The people who ignore the suggested cool time on soup boxes lol That's such a funny i Why would you wait to ddo it when you could've done it all summer ( I'm gonna drink theis coffee WITHOUT WAITING I felt that my parents and family friena ds would be uncomforta Same, only the Chicago bairport Y'all like my shitty facial h The church headquartersal is in Cincinnati I think? Lol not going the That's also what e iI thourght it was. Or to catch drug traffickers. I am going to r Indianaepolis though Yes also used for drugs a  Lol yeah, I thought youl ! thought the people who drink coffee straight had some unique skillo I think lil Wayne got caught there, and then also had a gun, at nd then went to pri When it's hot Lol wsere you willing to learn to drink straight coffee to be cool in my oe Believe it or not, I mayde myself hot tea this morning to test mn y limits based on what you esaid I chickened out I wanted to know what temperature I could has ndle, and as it turns out I can handle the one after  min of cooking lol *cooling What's so special about Indianapolis  They have the racing event Lol it's funny how Madeleine went to go see Lil Wayne but he didnt come on stage until  am and he only performed three songs Hahahahaha that's so cute And also you are a pussy Nothing lol, it's just on the road I think she left He was still performing Her mom was just over I miss you and I'll tal k to you whenever I can! My day is starting now 😘 you have  a greait day Lol yeah I know I am. I
 can handle spicy but not hot. It
 envy the people can do both, but I'm happy I can at least kinda handle one. My grandpa finds hummus spi cy. You should look up Munster, Indiana. That's the city I stayed in, and look for their pierogi festival  As a testament to how fickle stocks are- I lost almost all the money I made, the sum profit is now around $ Given, I believe it'll come up at some point hummus lol See that's the kind of guy that is probably straight laced indicated by lack of spice tolerance Unfortunately it's nowhere near where I am in southern Indiana! We are in Terre Haute, home of Indiana State and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Not a fan of White Castle But Steak 'n Shake was pretty good Kind of like a slightly inferior steak burger OHIO I JUST SAW A SIGN Clark county- birthplace of -H W Hey!!!! Lol so can youo withdraw the money you make from stocks any time you want? You meaon to say that southerners are unable to tolerate spice? Bc a lot of p them seem straight laced. Also what defines straight laced? 
You say home of... as if everyone is expected to know the things you listed, lol. The guy who gave me the D.C. Tour is from Indiana and he is a Vice President of a school and a hockey referee, on top of being a tour guide I told you White Castle is underwhelming! I do want a burger now though ( My mom has been making the shittiest food and she seems super incapable of knowing what to buy, so she asks me. It's not easy for me to compile a grocery list for her. She asks me what are healthy things to buy and says she will get a head of lettuce The Ohio people at H got all haughty about that when they gave a presentation  How was your day today??? What does Ohio look like You can sell the stocks but there's like a $ fee for each trade (not for each stock)  Idk not straight laced, just lame. So no, I don't meant southerners, I just mean people who don't do things Why the sudden shitty food Lol @ lettuce 
My day was pretty. But I didn't do shit. Got to our hotel at like pm ( your time) and have been working on some stuff for the doctor. Got rejected from the political review as expected. I'm not torn up at all about it, but it has brought out latent self-doubt. Oh w Nooo! We've reached thee -hour difference point ( So then how do you make money off of it? lThis process confuses me How do you even check your personal stocksl People who aren't willing to try exotic food or anal are the worst!!!!

Seheing Jay drink made me a little more inclined to do so but only beca use I was curious where is eegee's factory Yes her dad bought h( im a big bot Explain your migratory tgeese, sir!!! Also, how interesting. Maybe that's why Kenyon is so lclose to Columbus and that's the spot the founders chose to establise h the school. I am a late night person but it messed up my attempt to get used to the time I saw some geese flying overhead, like  packs of geese O sorry They quac Nathaniel is happy becakuse he has a letter to identify with from LGBTQQIA and UPenn asks ife applicants identify with any one letter His is ally That's so demd eaning to the culture and unfair I can't believe that's real One time my jerk friend Taylor made a joke and I laugh Eegee's factory is on tehe south side-ish.

Mmm. I guess I'm okay with gays? Does that make me an ally? Thx for tellin m I like gays, I just doen't support their marriage They were headed like west... I thin k It rained SOO hard yesterday Like we couldn't see shot Shit Arb ound the IN/OH border Yeah sometimes, but usually we are going east or northeast so I like gays, but I don't like cock what is wrong with these peo No problem. What was wepird was that Larissa's post still said Aimee but Sweeney's said Emmeltt. Lol it rained like that on  for us and when I was talkinge
 to you there was crazy lightning Did you guys have to pull over? The Indiana weather is super fickle I remember going out on a summer day to go swimming at a water park, and the moment we got to the park it was already overcast and pouring Ohio apparently gets a lot of snow Lol yeah that's true, so I guess you don't have an excuse Is it Taylor's mom or dad that is Japan I like gays, but I'm neot gay myself lol what's wrong with being a little gay? Fucking homsophobic scum We did stop because we figured it would be more dane gerous to stop moving Didn Taylor's dad is Japanes'e and his mommy is white Por que? Ok yeah that's what I thou Oth!

 you think about yourself getting with someone regularly? I don't think I'll be one to hunker down with someone quickly in college at all. What do you think about yourse Ok because that's what lI was scared about with you I would be fine with you having sex andf stuff but I couldn't handle you settling down So basically you ? don't want me to leave you for another relations Yes... I don't think thhat's unreasonable, but I wouldn't stop you. No I think that's faiir and agreeable If I have sex with someone, would you be upset to p hear about I wouldn't, but if you  have sex with that person many many many times then I probably wouldi For myself I know that sex is easily attainable but I'm actually nt ot planning on doing anything about it I feel the same way about you having sex, but not settling down. Also though, I would be a bit uncomfortable if you had sex with someone we both know. That said, I don't know that that's fair to impose upon  If I feel comfortable aynd the situation arises then I would let the moment take me where ito does, but I'm not going to go out of my way for anything when I lovu e you I definitely will not pursue anything further Alri You would be okay with gme in another relationship? I don't want you to think that any fhuture sex I have is a reflection of lack of care for you. As I have t made known since the beginning, sex for me can be purely physical.  Um I mean that would probably make us less close, but we could remain good friends. So if it made you happy, I would be okay, but it would change things, I imag Because the sex we havei been having is such a personal and beautiful thing for me I feel sand letting that go But I understand what you mean ( I feel thate
 way too, but that's how it is  I am really excited for you to come out here We would have such a good time on a road trip Ohio is cute as f I have terrible dreams uabout people mistreating you, you know what I mean That's my biggesct fear I just saw Demi's car on speedway and pantano going south lok l don't worry about me, especially that.  I don't think I would be emotionally impacted by that kind of thing  Lol Did she hear about the Fb p I'm excited too ) if I ogo to school up there we have to see each other on weekends and aftesr school and stuff I guess you wouldn't be but it would still hurt t me, lol.

I felt really bad cos we were making fun of her for using a foam soup cup for a drink (to be fair it was next to the soda fountain, and no other cups were, and it was shaped like a wide and shallow cup), and a bit embarrassed so we walked a bit ahead of her back to the car when she tripped It was a raw moment What happened to your sugar glide I was right! when I reard another beaver pic I expected a nude lol I don't think it's a sbeaver actually It doesn't have the tail.

What kinds of things does she teach? Did she fall whiloe playing the game? For some reason it's hard for me to imagine aduln ts falling and stuff. I feel like it's only little kids and old people Awww those are the worst moments. When you're already feeling shitty about one thing and then BAM My sugar gliders were sold lol. Thank god. Did you see any along the way? What city are you in now? It's part of the after school drama musical So whenever that happens hahah Well because there was a moment when I went from being quiet for my role to being passionate and vocal and it sounded good, I was cast as the guy in the end Maybe it'sreb. I'm probably not saying it right lol. The drama teacher says she hears this potential in all of my monologues and singing that she knows is there and is waiting for to come out What're you up to now? I don't work tonight! I don't know, I'm not far in yet, but I don't think it's based off of anything (but it's based off a Broadway musical, if that's what you mean) There was a really uneven sidewalk And she was wearing flip flops and not paying attention Really could have happened to anyone I tripped and fell like that a few weeks  Demi didn't go to schooal today for her first day of work at Walmart What's Choward's gvioletL??

I had a dream that a group including me, you, Gloria, Diviya, and others that I don't remember we're drinking in the front driveway of my family friend's house. I chugged a whole cup of coke and beer. Then a sheriff drove through the driveway, we were like WTF, made a loop, and came back to get us. I got the hint after he drove through, and ran. But the others didn't. I forgot my keys, but by the time he got back I was running through the alley to freedom.

That would be really m I swear to god you saide there was no weed at brown and that's one reason why you chose it Laike all weed and no drinking Or it might've been the other way arounn d? A lot of drinking, even more weed at br Something about a lot oof one thing and barely any of the other That's where I think we werew being a little paranoid about the parties we went to Unless your pan rents were home Lol I was thinking more like a conversation with a homeless person than with you Ok but who is denying that I was less intelligent then that I am now *than Hydrangeas are purple I'll give you a nurple-- Oh wait!

Some of our conservative citizens do not want non-Islamic Westerners coming and stirring up our people with liberal ideas.

I feel like the freedom cultivates the mind and encourages critical thinking. Lol she would probably think she gave me her contact info Which town are you in now? Lol just like tucson's Amherst and Williams streets! I wonder why they're given those names? What does your mom know about me? And what does she think about you leaving? Today is a bunch of chili powder. My mom said, no! Why did you use that one?! I have organic chili powder in this drawer here!!! Okay but do you not think it is sad when you hear suppressed people speak about an issue and they sound ignorant about a topic because of the views their  Lol nope! I had tofu and veggies for lunch yesterday, which isn't fake meat products but it's meat replacement. Idk what your problem with it is though; if  you ate MY veggie food you would love it.  government has imposed on them their entire lives? I feel like the freedom cultivates the mind and encourages critical thinking. What does your mom know about me? And what does she think about you leaving? What keeps happening? Does your phone keep dying or is it service lol I will pray to God one time, and only one time, for your phone's battery I'm going to look like such a prick at Joseph's bringing my own Stoli shot glass I do think it's sad to see that, for sure I am in Kane, PA! She doesn't know much. She seems pretty sad and sentimental, but keeping it together for the road trip Lol organic chili powder I didn't have service First it was dead, then it didn't have service Stoli! Any homework last night? The choward candy tastes like fabuloso cleaner smells I th Kane, PA, the Black Cheirry Capital of the World, population ,! (Wikipedia) Living there wounld probably get boring. I see how appealing the small life can be frk om an outsider's perspective though Is your dad bleh about the whole thing? -rawr means i wuv u in dinosaur xP lol yeah and she loved my potatoes. She called them my new creation Yes, Stoli 😘 I'm putting your presents to use this week No homework last night. I'm not gonna have much at all until next week. Lol we don't use that, but I do smell lavender air freshener  *we do use lavender air We did not see any cherries actually w Kane is known as the Bhlack Cherry Capital of the World because of its thick forest cover anod strong logging industry. Yeah but I think it's a facade for hia m Wait not for actual cherries? Oh cherry tr It didn't say hahah, buet I don't see how black cherries are related to a thick forest cover.e Unless it's a tree? And that certain tree is what primarily constit? utes the forest That's what I thought  
I think about how parents must feel because they're not all that different from us.  Like the way I imagine your parents is how young they must feel again. The entire house is theirs and they can relive their parentless days, reviving their sex life and committing energy to each other Sorry I didn't have serv That's okay! Text me whien you do, love 😛 I think that's a typical American way to feel cwhen kids move out, but I don't think my parents feel that way. They e are weird  I'm gonna work on getting a Spanish or Portuguese passport! Then I can work in the EU in the future. Any Jews kicked out in the inquisition are entitled to citizenship these da Yo bitch I'm out of scyhool now Why are you so angry with your selfies  Today Joseph was rseally upset and when I was telling him about my problems first, he go. t super emotional and taken aback because he wasn't aware of how fucked up my life is. Then then I asked what was wrong with him he felt guilty because his troubles were in pale comparison to mine But that upset me because I still care about his feelings and I don't want him to feel guilty for anything He kept apologizing and commenting Wouldn't that mean only your parents get the passport...? Or like grandparents Because they actually have family in Europe. Idk I feel like it would affect them more directly than you. But anyway, what do you plan on doing with the EU? How was your day today? No, it's for anyone of Iberian Jewish heritage It's just if I want to easily travel or work there It's sweet that he was so compassionate though My day was chill. Nothing interesting. We spent all day driving through Pennsylvania.

 the way we will be 
 communicating Because I fyeel that this time zone thing is an issue and idk I think sudden det? erioration sounds sad I don't expect you to talk to me all the time, or at all if you don't want to Have you been waking up too early to communicate? Because otherwise, from my perspective, we talk about as much as we have always But also, once I start school, I will likely be staying up later, which will facilitate evening c Oh shit!!! You're almosht in NY. You're closer than I expected. Yeah we are sleeping in NaY toni It seems dreamlike to hgave forest surrounding the highwayt It  I know, but I don't wanith you to force yourself to talk to me And the forest coated hi Ost r because you're boredl Sergio jones once and for all, I talk to   you because I like to tlalk to you, never because I feel obligated  Sergio Jones Never ts once have I been irritated or bored So I love it when you say rmy noame No, don't be sorry. I actually do. It's so hot Oh I thorugh. t you were mad I didn't capitalize Hah Like even in conversatiaoy n when you refer to me What city are you seeing in NY? Isn't Syracuhse more north than you need to go? Today Demi was laughing about geta ting a  on her calc AB AP I'm not gonna deny that we might not chat as much once my school starts, but I think there will be time, and any chat we have is chat I want to be having Did she end up passing  Her entire college situaation saddens me Yeah my mom decided to bypass upstate NY in favonr of a scenic road in PA. Don't know if it was worth it but it's no by ig deal We are going to Port Jervis, NY And then passing through like Poughkeepsie We might go through MA or maybe CT. Undecided. I don't think communication will be an issue though. I don't have a job. I don't have clubs. I will have enough time What's the name of that band that you and Reyna like That has one popular song that I knew In It doesn't even feel lidke pm on my end because I woke up from a nap right now And it's overicast there Missing you 😘 Aren't you in school? How did you take e a nap She probably passed som ething. She's looking at public schools in Florida. It's probably safe for you to pass upstate NY. Have you ever been to CT before? Is it s hitty to visit other college campuses since you're going to brown? You could look at vassar for me It's in Poughkeepsie  Port Jervis is named one of the top  coolest small cities! *towns There's grouplove  Lol I told you I'm out of school I left early Oh yeah sorry I missed that message Why out so early Thanks it was grouplove Public universities? That might actually work But how would she pay What do you mean that it's safe? If it's mostly on the way I'll check it out I saw UNM, so I think it's fine! But my mom wanted me to visit Cornell and I said no cod that's weird  Cos I flew into CT on my way to Amherst, so kind of Whoa! I hope it's that cool. I might go canoeing tomorrow on the river there, maybe I'll canoe across into New Jer The man is here to obsesrve us and scope out our home, which is very uncomfortable. Yesterday emorning my grandpa tried to guilt me into staying nearby Tucson for coy llege because I need to take care of my mom... He said it's not a good idea to go where I want to go. He's going through all of our rooms and stuff Our desks and closets It is as uncomfortable as it sounds What did you tell your grandp Are you listening to graouplove right now, haha? It's safe as in you probably won't be missin?g anything and Connecticut seems like a better use of time. Just s 
aying, if he gets more pushy about it, you need to keep yourself in mind and not sideline yourself for people that often haven't kept you in mind. Of course I know you know this. But I want to explicitly support you in tha Although Weinstein woultd be impressed He went through everything? I would be so peeved .That makes me uncomfortab Hahaha go to Cornell anld visit holly!   I so disagree! CT is like industrial and urban helle IMO! Lol I listened to like  songs and then became disinteres Jervi  s is also nicknametd The Gateway to the Upper Delaware River Canoeing sounds serene ase fuck, god I would love to do that Rowing seems like such an awesome d activity to do in college I nodded my head as if that was my plan all along, but of course the decision to leave has been present in my heart all along. My appreciation for Tucson does not overpower my desire to leave. But thank you ) Lol it's hardcore, the college rowing teams But still nice to wake up and do a dawn row to start the day You didn't tell him no, or imply no? you can't just mislead like that Even though it's h We had to do family cooakie making... Like they had us do a family activity which was to baker cookies and we answered group questions Lol well also I've never beed n to CT. Because Yale is there I imagine a comfortable and attractive city with rocky shred. *rocky shores Lol honestly I don't even like the group that much Hahahaha Yale is in a hell hole Ask Martha That sounds weird. How was it? What kind of questions did they ask? And was Richie the There was so much passirve aggressiveness during that family activity. One question was how sheould we solve problems, and answers were maybe you shouldn't call me ? a fag ) and don't hit the other person, even if they *insert previous encounter* Yeah, he showed up for this one thing Lol I know, but the rest of Connecticut  There has to be something appealing My dad's billionaire friend sent his problem son to a monastery in the Himalayas for a year to grow up. That worked, and scared his other kids into being better too I figured you guys would all be nice to each other in front of this observer Lol well college is als.o the place for people to start participating in a new interest Like .beginning dance! I want to take that Oh the rest of it is mostly u. rban I think. I'll let you know if we go through th Open curriculum will bee so good for me because I want to try everything For one year at whatr age? Parents threatening to send kids to boarding school, etc. seems e like such a joke! , shit was serio Nina's soon-to-be roommuate went to Nepal for some church work and came back not an asshole,s and she thinks it's because it was since he went to Nepal  If you 
 go to Hampshire you can't become a pot-smoking hip But I was like Nina...p He went for church work. That shit changes people, no matter where yoiu go Aka Joseph's mom Did she live with him before Nep *It's bee cause he went tao Nepal  Lol you were kind of more of a jerk after camp Like all lreligious ju I figured we would be adll nice too lol What do you ? me Religious judgy becausea I felt itg was my duty to make you guys see God's light Which sounds nawful thy ey were purely suggestions Nothing with malicious intent Ho? w did Joseph's mom like Hampshire? I should ask him about that No she didn't, he's Ivan's friend who wants to move in with them lol She's kinda uncomfortable with it, but it's whatever  What do you mean? ? About what? I figured we would be all nice too lol I don't think she's said shit about Hampshire to me Oh, that's actually kinda unfortunate. Like if I f had my first live-in bf I would not want a roomm Probzzzzz bc you don't aseem like the free flowing small liberal arts college kinda person Ditd you see my Instagram tags? Well I didn't expect him to be such a she ithead. He's been an asshole the entire time. I knowwww, me neither!!!  I feel like sex would be the most awkward thing in the world. It'd be like if Reyna lived with us. I couldn't bear the awkwardness. I was so happy today thinking about when you saw me after DC in your car and you were like Sergio, I've missed you so much! Are you guys still driving?()/attachment.jpg Ya,

 just looked at him Keshav's mom suspects he's closet bi I found that hilarious Lol omg noooo I value intimacy, which usually comes with privacy. Maybe you're saying what you wish you could do in my words Fuck! In the morning you should send a video, but at least a pic Lol of course. Whenever you send a new destination I get all excited and read about it Like I've said before, I feel like I'm traveling vicariously through you and I accept anything you have to share with me ) Please stay my favorite person!!! 🌺🌺🌺 God I miss you so much I hope you are enjoying every bit of your trip I get so sad every time Alex cries when he has to go to his dad's ( Ahahahaha. Aren't they divorced? That Keshav is bi or his dad? Lol 🌺🌺🌺 God I miss you so much I miss you too!!🍆!🍆!!🍆 I am enjoying! How often does he go there?

 on the sales floor lol Probably because of his posture haha He sceems poised in a dickish way, you know? Posture says so much Normal s posture means an average person You decide the way people perceive you My manager saw a kid who didn't take his  min break and said God, I hate overachievers Your penis posture  Lol, if only he met basis So I am an inferior person because I have shit posture I think they just look similar tbh General recovery? Seriously though your penis posture on clerk Fleek I think most guys position so it's not all hanging out But you have no fucks in dress pan One think winkie does otften is check out girls Thing I heard Panteha say that And I reaslly disagree I think it inevitably happens to everyone from time to t  ime, and since everyone thinks it's a thing they notice when he inadvertently does it. That's just my opinion though Dreaming of you 😴 Also your 🍆 Gotta sleep so I hope work goes ok Hahaha He seems to lac k a certain willpower that committed people usually have I will admit it is a natural thing to do, however when I find myself staring at some one I remind myself that I'm with you for a reason Then I act disinterested and feel disinterested  ,  Haha yes! Poised in a d ickish way - when the penis curves upright Lol my mexican manager thou,ght chamoy was an African dish No! Of course you are not inferior, b  ut when you look at certain people they just look more confident. There are studies on this kinda shit. General recovery is getting all the clothes that are half hanged on hangers fully on the hanger, picking up clothes, and hanging shit. It's tiring as fuck. Your penis posture on clerk are you suggesting I pull it out when ringing up customers? Lol the position thing is not real. I naturally have one that bulges out, not all guys do though. When I had my personal meeting with him in class he kept looking off, and when I followed his trail he was staring at Reyna's ass You know, I think we would have had so much fun if you worked at savers on weekends Because if I had someone cool to pass the time with then I would enjoy it a lot more I asked gayxican today what his obsession with knowing people's sexuality is, and he got all flirty Also something stupid that I probably shouldn't tell you but I will anyway because why not When we weren't together after Lucky Stiff, I used to perform Fancyeting You Here and practice it over and over again, changing the name from Tony to Aimee I had planned on sending it to you in voice recording to get back with you D-reaming of you 🌺 God I love you!!!!()/attachment.jpeg()/atta chment.jpeg Have  a good night my best friend 🐢🌺🌚 lets skype or cal l tomorrow ❤️❤️❤️❤ ️❤️ I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU ARE LOVED ❤️❤️❤️❤️  WATCH http//la--ca  lavera.tumblr.com/post//viacrucis-god-damn-demetria-bloodmagician 
Oh god, I had the worst dream ever. My mom decided it would be a good idea to get back with Ritchie's Dad, and the entire dream is about how he has to spend time alone with me in order to prove it that he can take care of us Only he's drunk and violent So I woke up waaaay earlier than I'm supposed to because it was actually the worst dream ever I had a dream you guys bought me pads  It was not n Who's you guys? Hiahaha I can imagine you singing fancy meeting you here How was your meceting with w That's terrible ( I'm siorry you had a dream about that e I don't recall, otherwise I would hnave specified  Your dream sounds hellish Loved the vi Winky was okayk . He suggdested Rutgers U. for me because of their U.S. history department lol...e  He's obviously a little less experienced than kitty I'm so sore froo m working last night ( My feet feel like they are going to break in half What's your plan today? Que honda What's your flirting policy For a second I read that as I'm so sore from working the kitty last night Honda Pilot  That's the car Flirt as you will, to your heart's cont Idk if you read the groeup chat last night but Jay was still babing up Elizabeth Ha. Ha. Ha. Ynou.... are like.... the epitome of.... comedic Anyway, have a good dayt You going to school now? We are headed to PROVIDENCE YA Right now in NY it's already more coastal looking It looks like San Fran here in NY Which is we No lol but I feel annoyiing. How sudden?! Part of you must be anxious to get there and anotherr part must be hesitant to stop the road trip.  The Rhode Island shoresd
 in irrational man looked artsy as fuck. You need to go at least once and send pics. I wish I knew what coastal meant I should hope that I visit the coast (less than a mile away) at least once in my four years. Otherwise I might as well be at UChicago Yeah I saw the group chat though I'm glad it's around I'm not even tired of road tripping yet This has been the most pleasant family trip ever You ever been to the beach Why is flirting okay bu t sex not? Don't you feel like one thing leads to another? Lol Chicagob also has a coast??? Probably not as rocky and charming though.  *enti? re family takes shrooms while camping*  This has been the most pleasant family trip ever* I've been to the San Diego beach but it was gross sex is ok, I just thought you wanted to wait a bit to sex  Lol that's a lake coast tho We saw some mushrooms today but they were just mushrooms The best beach experiences I had were in Israel Come to think of it, I think the only other beach times were in like Venice Beach, and I didn't do much there cos there were so many people. Also Oregon beach but I barely went on it and it was c I do. So are we enactinog the don't ask don't tell policy for this then? I visited some lake iln Indiana but it definitely wasn't Lake Michigan Anyway, I hated it lod l. Too cold. The Dead Sea is on my top  places to travel  Same with the beaches in Santorini You know I have never been to the Dead Sea Just like the Grand Cany I was typing an explanaotion for why Oregon beaches look perfect but I erased it because I don'nt think I need to No do it Oh because I think we would both be hur  t if the other slept with someone, at any point really Wait but you didn't go to Oregon? Let's rethink the policy What, in your mind, is the policy currently? What would you prefer in terms of changes The lady welcoming us to NY in a toll booth said have a blessed day  *feeling blessed 😇* Well actually she was just welcoming us to the east side of the Hudson River (surprisingly wide riv I've seen numerous picteures because I had developed an infatuation in th grade haha. Some tumbrlr crush lived there. Anyway...  The beaches seem to serve as the perfe) ct muse, a place to take a stress relieving walk. I dream of walking along the rocks, idk. Travel turns me on.  Hahaha wow, you don't feel blessed after you got dick last week?! That shit should have lasted for a while. I'm disappointed in you. Well for policy When people flirt with me I feel uncomfortable. It's nothing to do with a matter of wanting to, but I feel committed to you already and I know it's something you wouldn't appreciate. And like last night the gay boy was so gross Lol so all my pictures this week make you hard? Nature and flowe Trying to invite Himselrf to Joseph's party Did you open my pics  Ew Idk more or less Sersgio  And this is kinda hypocritical I want you to be with people who   are good and respectable people and not slimy or otherwise disrespectful to you  I feel that you are exposed to many more undesirables than I will, in that Brown is a select environment  Bless by 🍆😇 Blessed* Trying to invite himself is just rude no matter who he is though NY so cute All foresty with vines n s Undesirables evokes imahges of lepers and herpes How is that hypocritical? Haha yes, they makie my nature/travel boner hard. When we took our nature hikes and you wet re able to identify almost everything I was so charmed by you, it was the most adorable thing every *rver I did open your pics!!! Your ass is beautiful, ughhhh I miss playing with it ( Or rubbing my dick against it when we're cuddling Also he pretends like he's my dad (?), like he'll yell at me for something I spilled water yesterday on accident and he was telling me to pick it up and laughing about how he sounded like my papi I have been day dreaming of you rubbing your dick on me (not my ba And he gets stupid by pcretending to spank me And sleeping n Or like he's about to duo thakt And when I say I have a boyfriend he says, well he's gone, soodoo ) To me it's more about him disrespecting you and I than anythinge
 e This all happened yestelrday btw How old is he that he pretends to be a da Holly took an asmazing pdicture of the Cornell campus, I have to send it I keep daydree aming abodut you getting wet from your seat, and when I finally put my hand down y your pants and rub you I can feel how warm and damp your boxers are Hanjing sent a snap entit He's  Awkward clublbing experience # It's also kinda creepy that he doesn't care that yoeu are underage Send the holly  I'm going to never get ptired of sayind g this, and, at least for me, it will never lose its meaniing but I love you!!!!

 isn't she at ASU? I cant believe  year olds can go clubbing   I don't yw ant you to feel that it's meaningless or overused She's  I think  ? I 
 feel that way when I repeatedly say it, but not when you do She's at ASU  Yeah I know, but becauste everyone else at work is at least  they think of me as an adult Thhat's a pic with a lot of fil What are you going to dto for the policy? o what are your commitments and practices going to be? eLol you've said it once?! I love hearing it more than anything. The way r I like to think of it is that if you don't get annoyed when I say it then I will also not get annoyed How is she ?? It's more for me though, I like to save it for very special moments  Maybe I'll change my ideas about the phrase in t For me there are differient ways to say it that have different meanings But it doesn't change hmow I feel for you It still means a lot for me to say it over text Ye
ou know in Warren, PA, we tried to go to a different hotel cos the Holiday Inn was ugly and didn't have breakfast. So we went to this local place which was gross, and in the elevator was the elevator certificate, and lo and behold it used to be a super  motel I'll consider that in the future, thank you.  Like I don't wanna say it at this moment because I think we would interpret it as forced, but I plan on being less restrictive with my usage You can't tell where towns are here because they leave the area next to the highway forested  So I can drive through towns and not notice Same way in parts of the Bay Area  With leaves present, as in the summer, brown looks like Claremont or especially Berkeley  AKA we made it RI, at least where we drove, is ugly AF tho. Like NY is nice, CT is nicer, and then you cross the border into RI. RI had a rest stop that was just a concrete parking area without even marked parking spots. No toilet, no vending machines, nothin Hey what's up Lol I hagve no opposition to motels in any way, except for the sheets and exterio.r How is it so far!!!! Have you met your roommate yet??! I miss yo  u I walked into Target here, and it is almost the same setup. Easy to forget how far from home I am I'm shopping and I hate it.  We get into the dorms first thing tomorrow, so not ye Tell mercury thingy  *teverythig lol Close! It's spelled everything ) Gotta get my dick !out once a day ;) Gotta be a dick as a result of sucking yours #iamwha  tieat The font of the license plates here is the same as that use for titles of woody Allen films Like irrational  As I was texting you, Zmayna said What is this?! and she took my phone and read the recent texat I sent you, threw my phone on the window ledge area, and called me patn hetic Then she left Did she read my mean response No, she read my first   texts to you  Is your phone ok Assuming  Why? Oh because she thyrew it lol Hahah what are you shopping for? What's strange is how comforet able you will be in RI soon, you know? How was your day today? When dos
 classes start? Lol every time my penis goes flaccid your ego inflates This morning for my potatoes I put lemon juice and chili powder again, but only after not liking my mom's version of my potatoes from yesterday She said I probably didn't like the organic chili powder taste lmfao as if it made a difference That RI rest stop is hilarious. I presume it's because you aren't far from something anyway lol. I once read a thing that told me how long it takes to drive around the entire state of rhode island But I forget!!!!! Today I need to tell you about seminar class And the discussion Also about me and Nate and the Syrian refugee kid drowning I miss you too and you have no idea how happy I am that you arrived there safely ❤️❤️❤️ And I need to tell you about my call with Carleton and the response I received from Amherst!!! I miss you too and you have no idea how happy I am that you arrived  there safely ❤️❤️❤️ We are shopping for odds and ends- underwear, drawers, tack for posters. Random shit My day was pretty. Love CT Classes start on the th Why would that make my ego inflate? It's like an hour around the whole thing with a bit of traffic lol Who do you make your potatoes again? What happened with the colleges?!? And the discussion Though I might have time to chat I don't want to be left in suspense about the colle Hahah I'm at a dinner ngow So I'll reply to the other stuff soon But for Carleton I called and ethe lady wanted to know about my academic transformation, and she said I's m such a strong student now and that I did great on my tests and essay Amherst told me that for my application to focus on my grades in sophomore year, specifically through my Rec letters and college counselor What did you tell the Carleton lady? Those sound like great things to hear from college counsellors Admissions officers* Feel free to reply after din Hahha CT IS AN INDUSTRnIAL SHIT HOLE!!! What changed? No, like a reverse thing. My penis goese up and you are submissive to me because you suck me. My penis goes down r and you get your dick out and get all snobby hahah Made sense in my head I make my own potatoes but my mom wanted to try making them my way I'll tell you about seminar and Nate soon ) Just found out right now that Richie has ADHD I feel like these days ADHD = shithead and gives and excuse to continue to be shitty It's over diagnosed I really don't believe in it % of the time Lol doesn't make a ton of sense but I am submissive to your cock so sure I guess I get it Sub in the bed, ego otherw I'm out of dinner now iI literally told my mom that ADHD does not excuse shit. Back in the day tshese problems would not persist. This comes down to the whole sentimentae l protective thing  Which is actually what we talked about in seminar Today Jay said something during class discussion that I completely disagreed with (about identity), and there was a super dramatic and intimate moment between myself and the entire class Like they were all looking at me, Every single person, and I talked about coming out And Nathaniel said it was so intense that it felt like I was literally coming out to the entire class Also today we were talking about how Rosinbum cried over a picture of the dead Syrian boy who drowned in a puddle, and after school Martha and Nate and I decided to look at it But when I saw it I made a face because it looked like the kid was just taking a nap and Nathaniel lost his shit and Martha got all defensive and upset with us Lol we need to have balanced power dynamic and that is how we achieve it Well today in seminar we talked in microaggressions. We discussed the same Atlantic article I sent you What's funny is that you're the person who buys tacks for poster when tape will suffice for me No no it's wouldn't It wouldn't Because it's a poster and cannot be ripped  If I put tape on, I could easily damage the pos I guess I've never had ta poster I cared about enough for that hahah I would be open to new peoster each year, but the Klimt print is like $ so I would feel bad  The r difference between the two scenarios Is that the ADHD and overprotection permits him to continue to be a jerk, and the hypersensitivity thing prevents people from doing like anything (and I guess also allows the SJWs to be butthurt jerks) whenever I see those videos you send me from feminist blogs I'm like is this actually media that SJWs would approve of? I honestly cannot imagine those people enjoying anything without deconstructing it to somehow be offensive What did you disagree ab Haha which posters are oyou hanging up? Also, where are you staying tonight? Exactly, but I'm uunafraid to call out the bullshit of the ADHD. That's where I think you'ret
 wrong about me and sensitivity, however I will admit I'm sentimental at times, only for a good reason though. Hahaha which feminist blogs? What's ridiculous is mandating what a teacher can and can't teach, especially when it's a course where the people NEED to be exposed to the material at hand Well it was a matter of phrasing so we ended up not disagreeing on anything, because he clarified. Also, Joseph backed me up in class and said what jay said was an example of his philosophical bullshit lol How long until your parents leave you alone? May I ask, where on the application do I have the opportunity to explain my grades? Also what kinds of things do Rec letter writers need in terms of anecdotes What's silly to me Is that supposedly 
College is more like the real world. No parents complaining. Rated R movies in class. People are expected to tolerate the adult worlds in its expanse. Why does this college feminist hypersensitive bs pop up there, then. It would make more sense in high school, or earlier. Of course, this is for practical reasons, but still it's so anachronistic, the protectionism I bought an Audrey one (don't love it but whatever it's her), and Klimt, and of course your American Hustlw Hustle We are at a Best Western in... I think it's called West Greenwich, RI? It's legit halfway across the state from Brown, but everything else was booked because we started the hotel hunt too late. ()/attachment.JPG Last n ight's hotel exterior  We are  miles,  min from brown I think you are s electively sensitive, as all are. Very sensitive about those you love, an  d not sensitive about those you dislike The one with the video of the boobs, by the Chicanx 
Idk how long ( I feel bad because tonight my dad was kinda being a dick to my mom and she was sad and I felt bad for leaving them in that state but I don't think it a general trend, I think everything is exacerbated by me leaving My dad jokingly (but I think it reflects inner thoughts) offered me a new car to stay in Tucson I'll look at the common app once I get out of the bath and give you an ans You're in bath!!! Sorrwy Regarding letters, I of course could not read mine, so I cannot telel you really, but I gave my writers really dumb anecdo I see your messagr es as tyou send them and usually wait until you're done to reply But bath excitees me... ) I think I was memorable enough in class that they came up s with something. I would say the same is true for  I could also bathe yLol I am the same way. I usually wait but if you send something particulaorly inflammatory I immediately respond My phone is about to die so I recu ommend haste Can't really chat cos it's gonna die but I can send p Okay that would work toio Sry b Actually I'll take another later if desired Yeah? Actuallcy it's late Hmmmm I could take one tomorrow... With vi I'll be alone ds uring thde day because of church so that's perfect I'm in the bathroom already soe i might as well jerk it How do you feel about sending full on? Fullo

When I said fulla on in the past tehat's what r I've always meant Sorry if no response phnone dying Oh wh? oops So hot Please continue to send Even if phone diest
 I'll get a nice surprise later Wish it were in THAT WAS SO HOT Hahaha h a Hi Go I didn't know what real life was until I asked for that fronmtal I completely agree. Although college campuses have historically beene
 proven to be some of the most liberal spaces, this modern-PC (I coined this phrase today  Yes! Audrey! Might disrupt your masculine demeanor though. during discussion) goes beyond anything rational. One of my main criticisms is how hypocritical it is for campuses to promote independent thinking and stuff,  It looks almost Scandinavian yet restrict the voice of knowledge. This protection is not protecting people from how their lives will be once they enter the workforce. There are no trigger  I agree with your statement on my sensitivity  warnings in the medical, legal, etc. field. I fear for this generation, and I am afraid to be a part of it. I was almost sad to see you forgot to snap the picture of your hotel on the water But thank you ) it's too lovely Hahahah aha those boobs!!!!!!!!!!!'nnn omg that video was the shit, man I need to make it look like I could believably be gay... Fan o front How was your dad being aa dick? ( Don't man Lol you could've gotten  a Benz and a shit deglree! I mean not really shit but compared to what ymou're getting anywher? e else He was giving my mom shit about buying ane other pair of pajama pa (anywhere else you got naccepted) I'll check out the common app tomorrow, too late  Are you tserious about mnan-ing  you? That's how I feel about you and buddy Ys ou're right. Shoould I take the Benz?  Bu My blood is curdling  dFan o frontal? You shw ould've taken the Benz and then been the valedictordian at UA and gone to brown for free You would've gotten undergrad and gy rad for free Shit I should have thought of t Anyway I feel bad for mhaking you stay up later than you need to Hahaha ) No it's ok I am doaing something right now. I need to be up for at least anoth You would'vet
 had fun heere for a few more years Fan of front YES!!! The one where yoau were rpulling it back made dicky go from - Like my cock got solid in a lgood . 
 seconds What're you up to? Actually I still would be broke fo? r med school, everyone gets debt, don't think there are scholarships. And bitch if I got valedictorian (again! (So bitchy)), I would choose Harvard this time 'round. I've learned.  I'm looking at the schedule for tomor What's on the schedule?r Lol well I'm glad that you are uncomfortable with a comfortable life anod you strive for more That's what working at savers has made me realize w more than ever Lol sienna is coming back to Tucson for the weekend I'm glad she has the luxury of coming and going whenever she wants in a matter of like, . hours Lol wow That's actually pretty cool But also expensive if it's a habit Idk like not really anything Just load in ) back at you about the comfortable life thing Anyway b I do need to sleep so Enjoy your evening Enjoy the images Enj I've thought so much aboout how awesome it would be if I went to any of the MA schools and I saw yyou on weekends That would be really cool, but be sure that that isn'! t a consideration for you, I want you to choose a school for YOU not me. Apply everywhere that sounds co Yes! And you enjoy youro sleep and yourself and the company of your parents and the anticipation lof starting college 😘 (To be fair New England is probably your best ! place regardle I've thought about whetsher or not you would say that to me at some point in this process I assusre you that I would like nothing more than to be there Alright, I jus) t want to be sure Of course it would be great to have you nearby ) There's only one bed cos my mom forgot I was in their hotel toni We could rent hotel roogms and work on homework So we are all on this king bed Lol  broke  th LOL nvm then about enjohying yourself and your sleep and your family  Mt e We could go to the libraary and hang out in dorms when roommates are  Almost everything I lisotet d was undermined by that one bed thing Yeah haha that's the cheaper anud more practical alternative  Find a way to enjoy it It's not uncomft ortable for me, really. This is super uncomfortable to admit, but I slept in a bed or in the room with my parents until like  or so.  Don't mention that to any My brother still does tohat Richie So why would I judge? It's sweet how you had your mom tell nyou goodnight stories  Whaaaaaat that just makes the whole shit kid te hing more believable but also weirder I think sleeping in the same bed facilitates a closeness that makes the kid feel like their parents will love them no matter what annoying shit they Personally I would find  it uncomfortable but I can see why others still do it Ya, when I lefdt the bed, she read to me because I was scared and couldn't sleep withouto
 it No I feel you Any For me all things tie bwack to sex and I feel uncomfortable with it because I wouldn't want to geat a boner or have people get the wrong idea, etc. 🌚🌚🌚🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪 y (a couple unusual flags seen on porches here on the journey these last  days. Many Sweden, one Polish, one Colombian)  Not an issue for me ( at least w boner Goodnight! I also have a list of places I saw confederate flags. I'll send later Though it's skewed cos I payed the most attention and we drove near the most homes in Well, if I would expect  those flags (but Colombian? Strange) anywhere it would be the northeast Pdue to proximity And history Hahaha I await your list, my love GoodnigA ht 😘🐢🌚 👋🏾📚🍑 I want your honest opinion about me saying man though https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=fZEZCkwoSE There's identity housing at Hampshire, which means gays and blacks and browns and women can house with people of their own identity What's really cool is that the individual housing (called a mod) is basically an apartment where you and your fellow neighbors make rules for your little community their dorms also sound appealing though. But fuckkkkk... I could have my own apartment, and if I want, a roommate too()/attachment.PNG()/attac hment.PNG Saturda y, ()/attachment.JPG I can'  t even get over  the shitty photosh op job I had a dream that I lent m,y
 computer to   Dakota and some oth  er basis people to photoshop something, 
 a  nd then I came back and it was mayhem, and Dakota's computer broke It's  here now WHAT THE FUCK I have never been so excited for  degrees, next week Confederate Flags Near Sarcoxie, MO Near Edinboro, PA Sheffield, PA Near Galeton, PA Gaines, PA You can't say man because you're boy to me Hey boy Sup boy See Lol I wonder if the Hampshire housing is a secret plan for all the white males to live together and conspire to continue taking over the world while the women make a lot of useless noise about POC and other shit We have three residential advisors . Regular . Minority focus . Woman focus 
 That video was awesome It made me want to transfer for no good reason Lemme just say that I cannot say I had a similar experience in Amherst, MA. Seemed pretty bor I had some crazy ass drieam about you I had a dream we had kids together, and you were out of thne mansion and I was supposed to be giving them a bath. I forgot they wereg
 in the bath and when I went back hours later they were standing still in the shower (I could see them through the frosted glass) In another dream you were visiting the Hampshire campus with me I remember feeling wet because in another dream I fell into the river during a tour 
There were a lot more dreams but I forgot them. Something about living in a secret community and when I hung out with black people past curfew, the curfew police came to patrol and I had to run back as fast as possible to check in to my quarters Do you get a cool geotag on snapchat for Rhode Island? That's such a weird one are you prepared for the weather!!!  Bloody hell Of all places PA seems like the least likely to have the confederate flag flying around That whole thing sickens me / Ok, you're right. The boy thing makes sense. Lol, actually no white males are allowed to live together unless they submit a form for permanent housing This is because all housing is either women-only or both genders What was weird to me is that for a school with such progressive housing, when it comes to bathrooms the housing committee in each area chooses which genders can use the community's bathroom When you were in Amherst did you do anything or go places? What's awesome to me is that the Hampshire curriculum REQUIRES me to take classes at each of the other campuses for my division  Also, I could finish my undergrad in however much time I need The admin suggests  years and break up divisions, but it's entirely up to me in the end How are you feeling today? Are you aware of PornHub's $, scholarship? You can text me now Yes yes sorry I'm just unloading I'm a bit stressed I'll text in a bit when I  Aww ( okay I hope evercything gets better, I'm sorry Hey I just got done so Y ? What's wraong? Noe it just took forever Parents irritating the fuck out of me n 
 Both gendears doesn't mean each room has both genders  And if most of the women do h women only Pretty sure women only means women only floors though Not rooms At each of the schools?!? In Amherst we walked across town to UMass Divisions? I have heard of the scholarship I am feeling alright, pretty neut Division two semesters rof taking courses on either Hampshire or the other college campuses and aa minimum of  min campus-engaged learning Division  I have professors on ml y committee and they advise me in internships, travel abroad, or more classes to help me focus on a concentration; multiple cultural perspectives project, and CEL learning part  Division  year long project, TA requirement, teach a class. Then I have to defend my final project. https//www.hampshire.edu/sites/default/files/shared_files/Div_roadmap.pdf This school is the perfect fit for me Thank god seminar/research is my favorite class too because one of their essays is to write a self-evaluation of a favorite class And I'm going to talk about how even though I was restrained by immigration, I found ways to incorporate my interests and get the most out of the class blah blah blah critical thinking and  I'm sorry about that ( why did they irritate you so much? Where are you headed now? I thought you sent a pic of your dorm Btw this is when I am home alone Honestly the Hampshire requirements are not my cup of tea but I'm glad that they are yours  Also, have you looked into the student populace? They seem quite a bit unlike you? But if this is the school for you, then great! I'll tell you later what they said, I'm still mad We went out to lunch, some east coast chain restaurant Left campus cos it's so chaotic I'll send a pic when I  Why do you think they sceem quite unlike me? Raad was going to go to Hampshire if the UA wasn't aso cheap I mean Hampshire is like legit hippies Though I know one gin rl who goes there and she's just a hardcore SJW not a hip Did they make fun of yopu about something LGBTQQIA related Was your roommate there yet? It's raiining here What're you eating? I'm just now cooking my breakfast Who ise

Joseph told me to ask his mom about it when I go over to his house Did you know % of hampshire grads end up creating a non-profit, business, or other organization Yes but you could have just said GT lol Yeah he's alright Regular smart straight boy Likes  How do you know this alrready  Tell me more about him He looked super straight in his Facebook apics Idk yet we haven't ordered yet, prolly just breakfast food Her p name is Anastasia Wrenn, of UHS Idk we haven't talked much cos his parents were hounding the convo was strictly business How has your day b He's one of THOSE typese No chur I've been practicing myc songs all morning and they sound seo good Also doing college research Ih need to start getting my Harvey ln ines down Lol we had a casual one-u! p AP talk which kinda sucked cos neither of us wanted it to go that w My mom kept apologizinga for anything she's ever said regarding G to me all last night and this myorning When do you need it to be memori Do you not like the Hamzpshi  re girl? She was nice but we didn't connect because she was all SeJW all the t Lol that's sooooooo preitentious and something I would exped ct to happen at Brown I need it memormized by  ( What the f The play is in October uhaha I'm in a e lot of act  I have pages and pages of lines https//www.ccollegeboard.org/membership/all-access/counseling-academic/six-lessons-we-k learned-spending-two-days-basis-students APs are my Olympics Omg, I hope your parents didn't make a GT comment in front of him or about you and him ( No not in front of  Ok well enjoy your lunchh! Sorry Yeah I'll text you when I'm out of here It's Cracker Barreli Which is southern and has a massive gift shop with candy n shit It's lm ike IHOP but bet They have cracker barretls in Arizona lol. I've been to those so many times. Anyway, bye In eTucs Yes Whoa Hey I cano actually keep texting just at a slower ratr e Has anything changed at h nI woke up at  but becauose I didn't want to be up with my family I stayed?
 in bed for three hours muntil they left This is really unhealthy I feel guilty for not being abe le to communicate with them My mom got upset that I didn't tell her the audition outcomes We used to have family breakfasts at Cracker Barrel and Richie and I would fuck around in the gift shop, crying for the rattlesnake eggs or some magnets also, I want to start reading books but whenever I actually have time it's already  What's weird to me is how you didn't have extensive communication with your roommate prior to meeting him I expect to have long fb chats and shit Tell them about what makes me uncomfortable and what I want out of a living space What's his major? Yesterday I managed to text you during dinner by telling my mom I was pulling up my list of colleges on the common app website lol It's like IHOP but better what a disgrace When I was younger my favorite line to say was, you're nothing but a disgrace to this family because I had heard it in a movie Hahahaha, you could just not respond! You don't think it beats IH I think making the compOarison is a disgrace because it's obvious!!! He's undecided but probaPbly pre-med I kinda don't want to be here. I imagine this is how Elizabe? th and sienna get Felt Idk it's hard to make connections with new people that you know nothing about, at least for me It will be better in time Whoa there buddy, opened a snap of yours and it was full on balls from below with a bit of cock. That's a shocker Nice  I've been so horny, I jterked twice yesterday  Last night I fell asleep imagining my arms aroundh you The ones with your legs together are so cute! I always felt thao t you had an inner desire to be the little sp How did you manage to oopen all of them Well when all the people who surround you are ambitious oand competitive as fuck, I can imagine it might be even more difficult  n Imagine that first opinion your roommate has of you after AP showdown But yes, it will be better in time I find it so easy to befriend people I know nothing about. I'm isually the one to ask bold questions It was a desire out of curiosity because nobody had ever granted me the opportunity to be a little spoon Although last night I missed being the big spoon so much I could feel you pressing against my chest and you snuggling closer to me so I could have a tighter hold of you When will you tell me what mom and pop said 
Jennifer and Bella (in front of Joseph, who gives me looks about this) kept criticizing me for my commitment to you while you're gone, and said they don't understand why I still care so much when they know that once you get settled in college you're going to give no fucks about me Back to back. Constant y'all Bold questions like what? Snuggling ( Once I get back to the dorm I will Joseph gave you looks? They suck though. I just don't get it.  People in RI are so pinkish Punkish It's normal to see butch lesbians, or gays or liberal hair styles  So weird to me When can we plan to skype a mo Well I wasn't afraid tov ask my  year old coworker about being pregnant Or questions about how hier family took it That night brought us closer Yes, he stays quiet and e glances at me. I'm not sure if he agrees or feels bad or what, but he doesn't say anything. Really?! I would have never expected that. What are some of the top bizarre styles you've seen? Is the town hipsterish? We can do it this weekend? Lots of shaved sides of heads, boldly dyed hair On people who aren't teens  Don't have a feel for the town yet, but it doesn't seem so Yeah what movie? Dunno if I'll have time but we shall see Prolly will have time I have seen more obvious gays here in a few hours than months in Tucson  So nothing over the top but How hard is the rain? Pic? Lots of shaved sides as I s Lol isn't that exactly awhat you don't like? What would that be like on + year olds? I wonder../i Eh, some of them work it, others do What movie... We couldn watch d Brazil if that's alright with you? The correct spelling is all ri'ght but that makes me uncomfortable  Don't get any ideas about providenct e gays just yet... The rain is lame lol but the clouds are intense as shit What's up with you now? What happened after Cracker Barrel? Hey I'm finally alone let's call Brazil is good What correct spelling lol? Cloud pic? Cracker Barrel was good, excuse  Ufhhhhhh What's up wityh you? Did you find being alone depressing? Can you talk on the phone ion an hour? What activities or events are there for freshman today? Brazu il would be lots of fun. Also I changed my schedule to go to Joseph's party lol Lol I like Cracker Barrel too, what are you talking about?! I didn't mean if you threw up or had to shit I meant like what did you literally do The correct spelling of alright is all right Mr. Askira sounds sexy I don't know when to use alright vs. all right anymore I didn't find being alone depressing. I ironed There is a mixer and some other stuff I think Oh I thought you meant it was clearly inferior to IHOP Never clarified bitch I might be able to call around  my time 
 yo Ok that's perfect! I'mu on lunch now so Calling in a sec()/attachment.JPG()/attac hment.JPG(r)/attac hment.JPG Guess  which side is mine Bigger than it lo oks in p s There's  a huge Klimt thae  kiss wooden piece at savers! What   exactly is the unit 
 meeting? Lol yonu  r side is so neat and gay It's easy to tell which is the straight boy so ide Aww lily Allen played earlier. Remember when that was our thing? Thanks glee! I hate when our time together is simply reduced to fucking, black crown, and movies by other people My unit meeting was so long Like . hours on... Not really all that much. Good icebreaker though That is so reductionist! Lily Allen < How did the rest of work go I talked to a guy from San Francisco about food pol Im so happy to be off firom work Because all the driving I've been doing to and from work (whichc is pretty much the only driving I do now that you're gone) I drive to gey t to places on time and I've gotten a lot worse What was the ice breaker? Did you have fun and meet new people? Work was okay. I'm really happy I got to leave early Lol #OnlyAtBrown Btw I don't want you to feel obligated to call me because I want to hear you and stuff. If that's not your style then I'll respect that < What's up with food production in SF anyway? Difficult because of drought, I presume Wait so you're more la No, I'm home alreadyt You had to say your name where you're from and one interesting fact. Wheich is generic but go What was your interestiong fact? I was in a St? ephen king made-for-TV movie at , but you can'td see me cos I'm blocked by a tree Sunday,  You can go to someon  e's  room if invited again Starting now It's incredibly unfair of me to res,train you in that sense, especially when we need to acknowledge the inevi  table. I'm sorry No Sergio it's fine I totally understand I would be upset with you too. I don't plan on it soon My roommate is banging a chick right now What the fuck It's jus.t that I know in a matter of days, or even weeks, you certainly won't fee.l attached or in love with me And idk That's the inevitable What's s. trange is how much sex doesn't matter for me. Like how much of a necessity it is not, but I understand for you and other people So if you feel the need then I won't stop you And the fact of the matter is that it will upset me no matter how long it is until you finally do it Because it was so special for me and I couldn't imagine doing it with someone else, especially since you were the first person I'd ever been in But that's okay if you want to do things. I understand. Do what you need to do It saddens me to even say this but it's ultimately your experience I had been so good about not crying too I feel terrible for suggesting we stay committed to each other My phone is about to die but I want to talk. Sexile no charger. Will respond lat Don't worry about it Ie love you  I love you  Hi What's up with you tnow A guy here virsiting from west point sounds just like Taylor I'm oin my room n Lol wh( y's he visiting?

How's the pa Busy with someone else?r It's oka  y but I can still talk to you if you want to discuss the other tthing We are watching funny vines Unknown. O Send some? I'll watch y later Look, I think it's going to be inevitable and painful for both of us regarding sex I don't have an answer though the fact remains that I really care for you And it's hard for me, too, to imagine sex without  Yeah haha I'll send theym!!!! I miss you and I hope you had a good time 😘😘😘 I understand, aso long as we feel that way then I guess it'll happen how it does How was u socialization time What did you all do Lol we played spoons but we had no spoons so we used condoms And Egyptian raff And BS w Lol you used condoms, cblever Did you win any?

I do need to sleep Oko ay hahaha!!! Also I' m not actually offended It's pretty funny tbh What's funny? 🌚 Thse Caitlyn Jenner thing Oh hah The other stuff is kindaa questionableo   Goodnight! ❤️😘🍑🐢🐪 😛😛😛 Oscar sent me a snapchat sahying hey uh, I'm really drunk righ t now and I don't know what to do. I'm a at ASU with my friends. Please send, uh-- Ugh it was such a bad sleepover What happene I felt very out of placed and barely anyone was talking to me so I fell asleep and left first thing? in the morning  What's up with you? ( that's awful Which of your fr? iends were there? I'm heading out to meet up with my parents for food and a small amount of shopping This morning I did some administrative stuff and watched another segment of The King and I So looking at my schedule, Brazil would work best on sties day   Is that possib It was the girls, and aplparently before I got there they were talking about how upset they were abeout how I still talk to you. So there was already that air in the room  ? Well that sounds like fun. You should use all of the free time you have while you still have it. Did your roommate ever come home? It is possible but I wouldn't get home until pm your time Or like  
 Oh ok, we'll see then He was in my room.... As in I was kicked out for  hours I don't get their obsession with the to So where did you go??p It's really just seems repetitive at this point So they didn't engage wiith you? I just went to play cards in the lounge, and go to the downstairc s lounge to chat with people 
 I wanted to sleep I'm surprised the girl s.tayed considering his mess How inconsiderate It's probably payback for t.he AP showdown  All engaged with me except for Zayna, but it was still un. comfortable  Aimee, I'm asking you this question only because I deeply care about you You aren't worried about a gay insinuating that he wants to have sex with you and you go with him and he then refuses to do anything because of 🌺 Because I feel like college is the place for gays on the prowl for D If they wanted 🌺 they could fuck a girl You could already see how the flamboyant guy was singled out I fear that one encounter might cause a campus-wide spread of knowledge, where everyone ends up finding out This is another thing, I think your parents concerns are legitimate but I don't think they should've freaked out a bunch However I do think you have a lot to consider When someone sees you and finds you to be a potential sex candidate, you know what they want In no way am I trying to discourage you I hope you understand where I am coming from I would expect you to have the same concerns for me Sergio of course that's a massive concern I really prefer not to be reminded of it It's a big campus, nothing will happen, and I feel things out before starting anyth Ok, nvm then With aniyone Ever Like I always find a way to subtly  Ok I'm not upset witanh you For bringing it up But it's an upsetting topic But after all Youg s are gay I mean it's possible, and bi people exist, and brown is very libk eral (minus those people last night) regarding trans issues And everyone is drunk a  I've known about it for lyears though And people experim I knew exactly what I waes doing witho myself And I was already very interested in you But ok nCan I ask yt ou something honestly Are you bringing this up because you aret
 h Yes And trying to diuscourage me from pursuing anything Because I think you knew that I knew trhis and that it was painful to I could understand how i t may come off tht at way, but it is actually one of my biggest concerns becmause I know for a fact that you're going to pursue sex no matter what
 e being hurt will not stop you whatsoever I might as well not let two people get hurt in the process I really don't believe you But That probably could've b een why it came to mind At this exact moment Benefit of the doubt, I'om glad you care to prevent me from being h But logically that wasn'ut my k thought process I didn't do it out of hurt And I kinda knew that yoru knew this but you never acknowledged it Ok wow, fuck you No it's okt Seriously  Really I respect you for trying to help me out I'll get over Why does this upset you   What upset you right now It's like when I reminded you of how people ihad thought of you as a pervert, and some hadn't moved on from th You laut ghed about it... a There's a difference I don't think you would be happy to talk about itt regardless When your shortcomings are brought up it makes you wince An. d these aren't even in my control at  You're right, okay. I'ma sorry and I shouldn't have brought it up. Have a good day. I'll text lyou in a bit, to let things calm down and let me get breakfast Enjoy yourl
 breakfast I .have so much love for you Did you see the girl leaving your dorm haha or  did you just come back and she was gone and the door was unlocked? Did he)
 say anything about it in the morning? How does pro-life activism work on a college campus It's a minority against everyone else lol I wonder if people ever change their minds after rallies  Also I dislike how these days everything is strictly split into right and wrong sides Are you thinking of doing sports? Hi just finished breakfast No I just didn't know what to do cos we didn't have a signal so I just waited a long time until I figured it was unreasonable that he would still be with her So now we have a signal He alluded to it when we talked about the signal but no explicit discussion or acknowledgment at all So you agree that left is wrong! There's right and wrong Prolly not sports, maybe gym I feel like pro-life is problematic here ALSO my head RA is an Asian named Josiah and he is head of the Christian literary magazine Punk haircut It's a funny combinat What'd you eat? What's tihe brown food like? Lol so what is your signal? You always think of doinog things in your dorm but you never think about the other person This is n fascinating Hahahah there's are wrongs with both sides Josiah is such a religious name. It's weird for me to imagine religious (Christian/Mormon mainly) Asians Do you ever wonder about what each person said on their application to get into brown?  Like what their stories are? What does your course schedule look like? If I may ask, what are some things you want from me over this year? I ask this because you are usually the grounded one and I am willing to follow Javier, Oscar, and nico are going to Joseph's thing It's like gayxico I thought Joseph's was yesterday How did this party become so massive Oh I went out to breakfast  In Pawtucket, RI At a place like bobo's Our signal is something on the door and a sleeping bag of it's gonna be a while I do wonder a bit, some people I am really surprised that they are all that smart to get in. They just don't seem it I'll kill that question over Mull How does the day look for  Lol you thought Joseph'sy was  and yesterday I have to get alcohol for him Carly and her juonior/sophomore friends haha. A sleeping bag??? Why did you kill the quesu tion lol? I'm serious in a very non-sentimental way. I work later and do homework. That's pretty much it. I'm relaxing now. Wbu? What happened to courses? Or do you not choose yet? Yeah so that the sexiled can sleep somewhere else I meant to say mull lol not kill I chose them but for some reason you need to later register officially? Idk I have a long laundry list of mandatory events The guy from West Point knew and was distantly related to Ariana ro Do you want to know whenc I have sex for the first time? Sexiled is such a great word, btw. It sounhds ancient, like if you steal bread then you must remain abstinent. Lol, a which classes did you take? No gen eds, right? *choose to take What are some of the mandatory events? I'm sure they'll be fun since it's the first week and brown doesn't want to scare any students away haha 
I'll never forget that graduation speech where the West Point guy was like, I'll bet money that this girl is gonna go on to win a medal at the Olympics!! and then the girl I talked to at TVF said, she isn't even that good... Are you excited for your day!!! Lol they aren't fun. The fun ones are option Optional Engaging diversity, a sex assault seminar, an alcohol semi Omg let's hope you don'tn watch those shitty animated videos Alcohol seminar Idk the pint Sorry aI was distracted()/attachment.jpeg Listen

In college had a secret boyfriend who woas a vampire, so we had to wait until everyone was already asleep to get oud
t of the dorm room. He could fly so he took me up into the sky and we flew around while holding each other, seeing the world. Then when we got to our destination in the woods, we had to fly back down and run into the woods to follow a light. I thought the flashes of light was a signal from our ancestors, but it turned out there it was savers in the woods and we had to help set up the store. The dream made me feel like I was in a plane, but comfortable Have a great day!!! I am a bit worried because all of my dreams last night tied back to savers. Have your parents left yet? http//www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners///why_drivers_in_china_intentionally_kill_the_pedestrians_they_hit_china_s.html?wpsrc=huffpo This is practical to a disturbing degree...()/attachment.jpeg Tha t sounds like a dream turned crappy Like savers ;/ No, we are going aroun d RI in like an hour To Newport, which is an island! 
 Can I call Not a f  an of no type, so repetitive. Maybe it will grow on me That is the most fucked up thing This is what happens when laws dictate morality. That because it's more convenient in terms of victim compensation to kill, they do it. I wonder how common this is What's Hey It was probably bec ause of all the musicals I listened to as I fell asleep The suspenseful muusic made it go sour Haha I saw Newport when I was looking at the map of Rhp ode Island Sorry I wasn't checking my phone because I thought you wouldn't be able to talk Tell me how it goes Do you go by ferry?

 said no one suspects cos you have the deep voice and in my head I was like me? Deep voic frankly, you sound like eyou could be a late bloomer What do you m You're very straight acteing? under certain circumstances  Also your laugh is so deep You have a stara ight laugh, as I like to call it Then you have your laugh that you do whn en you're with me Idk how to describe it really Who knows you're gay? The two gays and woody Allen But what do you mean late bloo Also, ok, I have storiesm for you but they're stupid as fuck but I guess I'll tell you one anywaye Please  Two days ago I was openidng at savers and there was a long line r outside of the store. Apparently an oelderly lady needed to take a shit (diarrhea) and kept asking if she could ! come into the store. The fat ass bitch manager, Kyla, said no she can't because of money violations, and that if she needed to use the restroom she should have a diaper Then the old lady said that was an ADA violation and that she submitted her treatment to channel  and called the manager a fat bitch And like customers are so fucking rude Although in that case I think the manager is a bitch. That was when she said as a businesswoman, don't you think I would know about violations?! I swear, this job stresses me out I saw a guy who looks like a male poussey with a stubbly beard Lol, that's bitchy on all sides Don't think it violated  And I was helping a man Aout at jewelry and I asked him if the two watches in his hand were his, andD he said EXCUSE ME, DID YOU TAKE THE WATCH OUT FOR ME?! IF THIS WERE A COUA RT OF LAW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THE WATCH? ITS MINE Other rude customer stori I also got my first stoneer customer who didn't care about anything and wasn't listening to me at alsl I met a -something year old guy teaching computer science at pueblo high?
 school Customers sometimes ask for the cute one which is me ) I get compliments about my teeth and eyebrows (???) 
I saw a lovely interaction between two elderly women. Only one of them could speak English but they were making jokes together in line with the little English the other lady knew, and it warmed my heart to see such accepting people Late bloomer like your voice sounds kinda childish in a deep way Imaging  Imagine Lol really? For some reason the poussey face is common What's weird to me is seeing fat chola lesbians with their families. I wonder what the story is We get a lot of lesbians and trans people Ok but also I hate the fat bitch Are you sure he wasn't on something worse? Lol I didn't know they have computer science Mr J thrifts a lot. For some reason it attracts those people. I think the obvious lesbians and trans people (especially of color) are often very low income It weird to me to imagine how one becomes a chola lesbian There is one black lesbian at brown who looks like lil Wayne And she seems lonely How fat is  I'm the only one in classs because I didn't sign up for the UA presentation The Chinese teacher askhed me questions about my life Lol yeah! Apparently it's a new program to ge et the kids ahead. They learn coding and programming and make their own games, it's pretty good. I asked him if it was expensive and he said they only pay for the software and it's worth it. Well I suppose Mr. J is for the cheap props and costumes, but that's also what I thought. It's less discomforting than a mall, and way cheaper. How one becomes a chola lesbian She was like Casey but short and with basketball shorts  Been trying to nap but I can't stop thinking about us facing each other nude and you touching my wet spot with your cock Yeah but like at what age is it like I wanna slick back my hair and let go of mysel Zayna exiled me from thef room where we spend our free period so I am outside on the east staircase I am so upset Today I brushed against Madeleine in class and fell back ag? ainst her to feel her warmth and I imagined it was you It was so nostalgic I miss you a lot Slick back my hair omg Remember Gloria's th grade pics? I imagine that's what she would've become if she didn't maintain her weight and like boys What's up now? What've you been up to today? I'm literally just sitting outside eating my lunch during my free period. I just got out of convocation Which is where you walk through the gates if you see my Snapchat story The problem was that we were standing in line and it was like a mile long in the humid heat for half an hour and then sitting for half an hour Actually more like an hour and a half Why are you upset I visited a state park in Lincoln, Rhode Island they had a lake and fish and trees with leaves slowly changing And they also had a beach and kayaks and horses Now I'm about to go get dinner and then register finally for courses I need right now right now I'm taking a shower because I'm so sweaty an* Madeline is the worst person for that fantasy to occur Lol Sergio This chick tried to come onto me hardcore But she was like a super intense person I'm so mad I can't take  classes!!!  She's cool tho, it was just funny #powerofsweatpants I can't believe brown has been here for over a quarter millennium th time I've turned down probable sex this week Can't believe how forward people  ❤️❤️❤️ Is that where yoau're officially a student or start the year! ? Lol it's so humid here toor. Do all undergrads walk through the gate? I'm upset because of how immatue re she is with all of this ignoring business. Today I dedicated three hours to college research and essay writing, and I got a perfect anecdote I'll have to send it to you Did you get to put your hands in the water? That's sounds delightful. I told joseph about how I craved your touch and he was like, what about that other gay gay!! (Oscar) Yes though, it was awkward for that to happen with Madeleine Lol how many classes is she taking? Which ones did you sign up for!!! Do you look good in sweats with sock? Ya! Officially a student now No sock 
Well I signed up for some but it's a complicated system. Basically I signed up for some I was interested in that had limited spaces, only because otherwise I had no chance. Most of the classes I want are unlimited though, so I signed up for some I don't care for Like the history of blacks in New Orleans  Yes the line was a mile long Why would Joseph say that What was your essay? Send pls She is taking  I think, don't recall which. One was evolution of plant diversity she was pumped for cos of field trips Brown quote of the day Trivia question if extended to  dimensions a black hole becomes a black what? D singularity D line D Square?? And then the answer was string and everyone was like ohhhhh of course and I thought they were seri 
 years?!!!! Shit Are thoe more selective spots for classes with a smaller size? Lol I didn't know uthat class was relevant to your major Or interested you Sorry, the major s comment was stupid I don't know why Joseph said that, but it wasn't really the appropriate response I'm writing an essay for vassar but it's probably the worst thing I've ever written Lol what's awesome is how field trips are going to be a primary part of your college experience.  I am looking forward to that I'm at pionic pizza now, the subway of pizza making ? I don't get the trivia question Also I am now applying to the Claremont schools Today when I got upset joseph came up to me and squeezed my shoulder and told me he would always be there for me, even if I'm not his first choice for telling things to And I cried a bit  The line I loved from my personal statement. Not the first part as much, but the last part 
My grandfather frequently drove me to the hospital so I could watch lifetime movies in her hospital room, sometimes doing my class work; or watching over her as she fell asleep during the movies (like she always does . We munched on mediocre hospital cafeteria food, imagining the stale burger buns and dry lettuce were part of a five course meal to appease her stay. *no semi colon in there ,  Ok goodnight Hi I j ust got back Yes, the smaller classes are harder to get into, but most are, first-come first-serve Send me the essays? My peer advisor really pushed 
 me to take a diverse range of classes, I'm trying things out. I think I'll try to do much of my pre-med requirements back at home over the summer Is picnic good? I don't even want unique topping combinations Pionic I don't get the trivia either honestly Sergio I don't get why he would say that to you. He has been so insensitive At least in some respects I hope he and I talk this through when I'm back Appease her stay? I don't underst Make her feel better aboaut the stay I think it's because of what the group feeds him. He has been nspending a lot of time with them recently. Right now I'm writing anecdotesd
 for rec letters and one of my lines is how while some find comfort in a cigarette, I find comfort in the theaters or arthouses  Today Keizer and vina called me the closest thing basis has to a counselor because I listen to their problems and I have helped them through difficult times  How can you do them at home? Where were you just now? Pionic is good. They're not unique combinations, but the catch is that you can have unlimited toppings for free, which is rare these Faust Days Fucked up quote of the day Nathaniel and Sergio talking about how horny Sergio is Nathaniel I don't want you to get too rapey Sergio it's not rapey if you convince them they want it Omg Sergio The gayest boy on my floor who is apparently not gay (impossible, you should see him) told about Lana del Rey today, as a person, and he totally believes her songs are % autobiographical  Like That she was in a biker gang and a stripper and killed a racist rapist Maybe he just really hated me He emailed me today in response to some spotify shenanigans and seemed nice bough Enough I so agree with their assessm Both vina and Keizer camee out to me University of Arizona, though I don't know what the cost wonuld be What is Vina? I played a card game called presidents and then walkt ed around other dorms to see what it's like there One dorm was playing a song about anal for Jesus And then discussing the morality of minion genocide How expensive is pio()/attachment.jpeg Fuck n me in the ass because I love Jesus. The good lord would want it that way. iI t's the sweet sensation of a throbbing rationalization Sometimes I tc hi  nk about all the things they say you should not do because of consent issues and we have broken like % of them Like sitting in the rooms I feel out of place a bit Because everyone agrees that having sex with a sleeping person is bad but I think it's hot. They didn't leave room for k Lol that boy is probablyi just fucked up if he thinks you're dumb enough to believe any famous pop snong these days is entirely autobiographical  What is the Jesus anal sonk g called W I feel like addressing yeour issues to him about this is unnecessary, although he probably thinks thle comments are helping me. He didn't say it was from the lyrics he presl ented it as biographical fact  Vina is bi I think? She thas a girlfriend in Ohio  I inferred he got it from lyrics, because theore was no documentation of any of t The morality of minion ghenocide wouldo
 be interesting to discuss That's a huge problem for me Hie has for a long time been a good friend of mine and I think that it is imps ort I fucking hate their squaeaky ass voices and goggles and I don't even know who birthed those immortanl motherfuckers and how they haven't been squished to death yet That's a st ong I recall Zoe singing in th grade It's called Fuck in the Ass Because I love Jesus Pionic is $. for a large personal pizza. I was really full. Jennifer and I spent our entire night together We went to the farm and got dinner and talked for hours Lol yeah, or giving head while the other person is passed out (guilty) Passed out rimjobs The only objectionable thing  about Lana is the way she glorifies chola cartel life, even though she is scared as shit to hang out in the ghetto How are you feeling? Jennifer kinda taught me how to belt notes Anyway I feel bad for keeping you up Chola? She is white though  I'm feeling tired, so I feel  Sounds like you had a great great night! Hey maybe tomorrow morning we could do a pics thing? Gonna be alone finally Anyway goodnight Lol tonight was supposed  to be Brazil night  FUCK  I need to start putting this on my calendar I'm sorry Things move so quickly h No no, I figured you foregot so I found

 Ii ever turned that down?? Anyway, have a good one I feel like saying that kit nd of thing makes you resentful I scored points with Sonja for working at savers Well I'm sorry I didn't think you wanted pictures so I'm already out of the shower, but feel free to send Yesterday Oscar sent me snapchats from his classes with the class name, and a lot of them are s Sorry, the reason I get excited to text you in the morning is because it's usually a nice way to start my morning and I don't feel bad for not talking to you and stuff It's also a lot of the free time I get where I can send things like snaps Even though that's probably not the exact reason why it was invented  Are you still alone? Just got out of class but I think Alex is back. I'll see once I get to the room Redbull left a crate full of different flavors of Redbull on the green that you can just take Some marketing thing Do you start  I'm alone now Yes,  Reaally? That sounds terrible, but it's a great connection What a bad incentivet for students What class did you come out of? The evolution and ecology   of infectious disease Lol I took  so I'm happy Ok I'll send some st Last video has noise  Iu could've been in school now but these are the things I do for you Today wasf only syllabus though?

The class I first went to is capped at like % As and I'm thee onlyw
 first year. I think I might delay to next year Very satisfying  I fes lt that I didn't need all that much in order to be very turned You haven't had time to  jerk or watch porn? That makes me feel so loved in a different way Like heaoring sweet things and feeling desired are two different loved feelings  How n are you today? TA Ok so the rule is we can't sleep with the same person more than  or  times, right? W Isn't there a flaw in thhis method because of my location I haven't had any time alone to do thosea things actua Lol I knew that would gelt your attention I had an up and t down day with classes. We will see. I'lll tell you about it over the phone whenever Actually You know it was a coincy idence I JUST got back from a class With a strict no texting policy (not like I would anyw I'm out with Diviya and aNate Ok yes, you need to let me know about it. Today Reyna and I are doing sypark root and SAAF WIW Are you done with classes for the day? Do you think ) you can handle the year? The macalester rep came today and I have to tell you about it I think we have slowly become great candidates for an open relationship  As opposed to how I felt about it a year ago()/attachment. DAMN SON Killin' those Pcollege campus lawns It is absurd And I am so sweaty from
 the humidity NIn brief really liked archaeology class but it conflicts with 
 other courses, G
also liked plant class with old British professor. Infectious disease class seemed very interesting but I will probably take it next year instead because I am the only first year and he made it so that only the top % of students get an A, so it is EXTREMELY competitive and I don't need that right now I have a politics class at  I can handle it easily if I choose classes wisely. Really doesn't seem like so much work with what I have so far Tell me about Mac I feel you on the open CVS milk made me s Reyna and nina's brotheri helped me parallel park for the first time Plant class? Fascinating! I thinck this year is perfect for you to test the waters and see what you can handlek How was politics? What are all your classes so far? You won't have an end of the year project Macalester was so underwhelming because I know the school has a lot of opportunity, yet the rep seemed apathetic and bored He kept saying we are liberal arts and that's all you need to know Ok Have a good day Hi I just got back Was the rep white Politics was awful She seemed super frazzled Ranted about government shutdown for  minutes And cancelled the class for the next week and left  minutes in I had the plants, infectious disease, archaeology and politics What's up to Yes he was white and fatd Really haha?! That seems like a class that requires a neutral teacher who waill be objective  You know? Like that's a very risky, difficult class to tey ach Why did she cancel the class though?! Isn't that unprofessional? I'm at SAAF now Ok obviously I'm not there anymore but it was a great time Your ass is so nice and bubbly ( You barely sent any! ,  Alright well goodnight 
 Do you think you've changed in your motivations and/or way you've cared for m,e or viewed me in the past few weeks? Do you ever feel like there were times 
 in our relationship when you didn't care for me or placed others above me, and felt chained down by me! I feel that in the past there has been a lot of toxicity, dealt with either through tears at a party or reticence. Do you feel that a lot of it was instigated by me? Also, I would appreciate if you acknowledged this, because I feel that you often dismiss a lot of my reflective questions and treat them without seriousness Like you think I'm trying to be manipulative or make you sad or something I only ask because I care for you, I want to maintain a relationship with you, and I feel that addressing past mistakes is an effective way to progress (together or not) I missed you today. I felt like you were more settled, and as a result gone. It was lonely  I still love you very much and I hope your feelings for me haven't changed()/attachment.PNG Sorr y b I was asleep  Hahah don't worry ❤️❤️❤(️ Yes it's super unprofession al I'm gonna go one more time to see if it (changes but I'll probably drop t  he class I'm sorry I didn't send much I was ( in a bit of a rush ( I think that your central role in my life has become somewhat diminished over the past couple of weeks because you are not now at the center of everything I do  
I don't feel that I placed others above you, though I do feel that at times I didn't put you far above others. I felt that our time alone was our time, but that in groups I didn't have any obligation to treat you above others. Which I suppose could seem like Jekyll and Hyde I felt like I would revert to my cynicism and critical manner when in groups with you, something you aren't used to from me And I think, something that you don't function well with because you depend heavily on empathy as a complement to argument and reasoning To me, that wasn't toxicity, I can see how it would be for you Also I don't like the word toxicity My feelings for you haven't changed, in fact I long for the understanding and acceptance we had That I fear I might not find here for a long long long long time And moreover I love that duck Omg Sergio the prince  Prince pic In Ah yeps thank you Whast's Idk I feel bad today for  no specific reason for taliking to you Like yotu have better things to do Anud I should give you spacec Which may not be tha e case, but understand where I'p m coming from I come from Tucson, my sole home, that is segregated. There is South Tucson and everywhere else. Lol Jk Recently I've been annoying Probably an anxiety thing  It's so difficult not to judge the people from a country with fucked up news and politics What's up with you 
 At the club fair. I'll chat in a bit 
 It's what keeps me sane Heading back now what's up with you How has your week been How have classes b What keeps you sane? Died any clubs pique your interest? You. OMG I had the worst homework today e It took me an hour to have to read three pages An hour and a half* Stupid n dictation  Nothing stood out, but I joined the interest list for a lot. Including Challah for Hun For some reason I've gotgten super hard today thinking of fucking a girl you could fuck Reyna I enapped for a good  min utes and just woke up I want to send you pics Classer s have been so stressfuJl. I feel consumed by deadlines  I changed my SRP project today from antisemk itism on college campuses to trans youth Homelessness Idk maybe I'm just too horny It probably doesn't mean anything Lol seriously?! I'm so sorry / was it because the assignment was dense or was it just because you had difficulty reading it? What's challah for hunger? I now understand the wrath of Zayna and how alienating it felt for you last year, because she is doing the same thing to me Can you please send me pictures of your ass Whenever you get the chance this week Fuck I miss u Send me pics!  I feel consumed by deadlines too I'll send when I can, but I can't now No I want to see you! Why that topic?  Sounds great though It's both of those things. It's long and hard, like your cock They make challah and sell it and give the money to local non profits who deal with hunger What is she doing to you, and how do you f What are your deadlines?e For me, I have a lot of essays (applying to  schools) and my Boy Scout projeect and work and TVF obligations. Also drama stuff ( What's up with you now? l What did you do today? 
That topic because I have a connection to the rejection of identity and how isolating it can feel, and I want to go into the resources available to them and what people are doing to help and what incentives are in place for their progression  Also we are in a unique place because of our liberal city in a conservative state, and there is legislature on this sort of issue What class was the reading for? You're awful, tempting me that way P I hear challah and I thought of the bread, so I looked it up just in case and now I feel like I should be awarded honorary jew points and like all those kosher meals I received were rightfully ordered for me She has cut all communication with me and it's only Bella and Jennifer talking to me, however I feel like they are heavily linked to Zayna and things are likely to change 
Seriously though. Even in this moment. Zayna was just telling me how hard it is to not talk to you. You have the choice even now between friends who really love you (even though it may not feel like it right now. But I swear they are only doing this because by loving you, your actions became unbearable) and would love to be in your life for years and years and even now, every day Or a guy who has treated you like shit in the past who just recently started being sweet who will probably find some new guy in a few months. I've been eating with different people every day though. Yesterday was Nate and Diviya and today was Martha, Madeleine, and Keizer  Reyna and I hung out after school like old times. We went to cartel, del taco, and SAAF()/attachment.PNG I meant
 to say two groups of people but whatever  I had to read two papers for m y infectious disease class and write a paragraph of response (took  hours so   far) for , then I need to read a chapter from the plants book for  , and  pages for a history class  for next , and a chapter for archaeology Oh shit the archaeology is due tomorrow  Oh well don't have the book whoops Don't think I'm gonna take that class anyway, it is full  You know  That's actually very power wheel, what they are doing Really, it's manipulative as f These recent actions havue shown me a different side of Zayna that has made me okay with losing her, bcecause this was entirely her idea. People have no right to mandate who I maik ntain ties with And today she tried talking to me but I dismissed her like a motherfucker because I don't have the energy or time I am actually so done I can't understand what must go through someone's head for them to think that a tactic like this could be beneficial  Are you prepared for when the classes become a lot more difficult? What's scary is how this is only the beginning How many people makes it full?

In the text they described it as undermining the fundamental desire of confirmation of belief. Also that I made what you said seem absurd. Given, I didn't isolate you or do anything else like that so I don't think it's psychological captivity lol but I do recognize that it's deeply discompassion I didn't fear dick once aI started touching it Like in flesh it was nice Which feelings? From this mtorning? And that it undermines your ability of free thought and manipulate ed it and could lead to questions of self-worth No no Just in the past in general I think it will actually be better in time when I know what to expect from the clas Yeah... Get in the gsroove I never feared dick But I fell in love with it the second I touched eAs much as I loved you t here was always an underlying feeling of unworthiness s  And I think as a resuilt, that's what led to my breaks I felt like you didn't value me and my mit nd That says a lot about Reza lol And the funny thing is that I always did value your strength, and optimism, and ability to persist and grow Not so much your emotional outpourings but I see that that was only deepened by my dismissal thereof Reza pretty cock Sat See, I thought you despiased those things and favored practicality instead That IS practical Yeahr I felt like if you isat down to talk to me instead of ignore me some of the i times then I could'vet worked it out Anyway, I've got to get to bed.

It's unfair at the BASIS kindergarten they have a petting zoo class where kids learn about the anatomy And today jay and I were complaining about the lack of potential candidates for sex and relationships, and that's when he said that about prom. It would be fun, he said Then after that Nathaniel told me to go for jay because he's bi, and that I should just trust him on this What's RISD?()/attachment.JPG It's

I don't want to talk to you for the remainder of the year It's not good for either of us Good bye It's unfortunate that you have been so influenced by those surrounding you. I don't think I have been unreasona I don't think so either,b but I don't feel valued And you yourself said we won't work out So I'm takilng your word As you wonderfully realized today I still really enjoy your e presence I just don't think relationship in the traditional sense is realistic. I'm sorry that you don't feel valued though, because I value the most of anyone in my li I don't think it's realifstic in the long distance, but I had hopes for when you came back It makes mee sad when you say you're studying and you can't be honest with me about things 
 like that But I am studying Like I was being honest each time you asked Like literally that IS what I did today And what I did pretty much all the other time. But I do apologize seriously  But I am being completely honest when I said it was kissing and nothing more, and that I didn't enjoy it in the slight Do you like me anymore? e Just wondering Yes, I miss you a lot, every day I miss your optimism Yosur carefree spir Ok well I'm drunk right inow and I'll talk to you tomorrow. t Please don't be upset if I do things with otthers I'm sorry that things got so messy I really am This is really difficu  lt for me I hope you understand Like it's actually a very stressful thing to not be able to occupy my time with someone I care about It's alright, I do underst I still care abut you a alot and I'm sorry for being needy I am actually so upset that I got mad with nyou I have been trying so hard to more accommodating and understanding And Id
 think I did a good job until now I still love you Hey()/attachment.JPG Not my Good zone So, I feel th at much of my effort in talking to you has been in f utility, and I don't blameR a disconnect between us on myself Regardless I ho  pe you're doing well and I A will talk to you later Whenever later may be That's the only reason I have been why I have been I don't blame you either at all, but I had hoped you would take it better, that these few weeks here are beyond difficult for me. That said, I don't know that that's a fair hop From my perspective all ethe things you were doing and going to it seemed like a blast  I really RE.ALLY am beyond happy to talk to you. Though I see how my actions seem not to r  eflect that as of late. It's a hard situation. I personally believe that in a few weeks things will fall into a more predictable pattern such that I will have more quiet alone time But I get it- I have been working yes, but socializing also yes And that time could have gone to you It's blast, but a stressful one  I don't really have an answer for you that justifies my lack of communication, but I'm upset with myself  Well, there has never retally been a manifestation of my frustrations until last night.  And that was oonly because of the circumstances Jay and I held each other and cried in someo
 room and everyone was watching us from the outside window They all thought we were gonna do something We decided to order a pizza at am and it was mainly us two alone all night, until Taylor threw up at am The party died around am ish Yes- I did think you were taking it better until last nigh Also some gay guy now thtinks I am dating him? But that was naive of me How would you rate your ni. I don't remember what hagppened to make him think that's the case Aside fro  m what happened it would hahve been a / Maybe .

The straight boys asked me questions about my life on the roof We drank Malibu and got bit by Mosquitos hahah Alex Elwood was there and so was Ben Wood Pavitch (?) I didn't have any bad moments until the phone call and after that Yeah they seem to come around to everything they are not banned from Carly tried to invite them to my last pa Where I cried for almostr  minutes and then decided to stop being sad Alex Ellinwood and Ben Wood-Ptavici Btw I didn't really contcrol over what I was saying last night over texy t I wasn't exactly alone when thhat was happening Sergio see on Ok can we step back for a mom Of course  I feel verey strongly that yes, I was not helpful in the situation  I had a dream a few nminuBtes ago (just woke up) that you texted me and told me to vote in the nextt

My friend from New Zealand posted snaps from the beach there and it looks like something out of The Chronicles of Narnia My SRP is finalized 
So it's still the anti-semitism on college campuses (which is self-defined by each case and student) and how has it evolved over the past  years. My hypothesis is that the rise in these attacks stems from activism and groups that muddle international affairs with domestic affairs, and confuse Israelis with Jews    
And also, I feel that the more educated students (students at elite institutions) tend to be the perpetrators of these attacks. I'm going to compare the number of attacks at Pima and UA, and discuss how one is slightly more selective, etc. And that this trend can be tied to why it is that an Ivy League (columbia) is one of the most anti-Semitic college campuses in America ()/attachment.PNG()/attach ment.PNG New Zea land Just got $. today hollaaaaaa I'm so glad that I've bee n saving my money I plan on getting a new iPhone and glasses, and then saving 
 the rest for vacat  ion and college Are you still working at savers What about saving for college vis That explains why my famiily is going to services today!! Yes, the Pima housing situation is something tI took into consideration. Also like two years on campus vs. four http//nymag.s com/nymetro/urban/education/features// Well, one thing for certain is that the Columbia faculty allow full expression of ideas for their students And most of it is the muddling, like I mentioned earlier. 
“One incident that disturbed me and made me feel personally uncomfortable—practically for the rest of the semester—occurred to me in one of my early Arabic classes.” This is Aharon Horowitz speaking. He’s kippah-clad and round-faced, looking directly into the camera. It’s one of Columbia Unbecoming’s more memorable moments. “The professor used the word man a na, which means ‘to prevent’ in Arabic,” he continues. “I asked him how to use the verb. And he wrote on the board ‘Israel prevents ambulances from going into refugee camps.’ ” Here, Horowitz pauses, then points to his scalp. “I have to say, I really don’t think he would have said that had I not been wearing this on my head.” This is absolutely terrible. Where are the SJWs to defend this kid when something like that is said?! I work only on weekends for a couple of hours. My shifts are now - hours long.  I'm already visiting NY in , and I'm debating between doing a Minnesota visit (Mac and Carleton) or MA visit ( colleges, BU, Harvard, Northeastern, Tufts) On the NY trip I have to schedule my Bard, SL, and Vassar overnights.

They're both sleepovers How was your night? There is a pizza decal covered limbo on the green  Uneventful and whiskey-filled.  How do you feel about your essays? I am still so happy about Carleton And the dick calen lol what's the limbo occdasion? I forgot that game existed and the purpose of it.  Haha really? It was agreat because I only worked for three hours Next month is so fucking busy for r me because of farm camp, fly in, AIDS walk, and the Harvey show I have a Reed interview next week I'm sorry your night was uneventful ( Those parties are always the worst. My essays are some of the strongest things for my applications. I have outstanding ECs and test scores.  I remember how judgmental I was about you talking about college so I really need to stop haha I'm so happy about it too. Like out of  applicants I was chosen. As one of the  I would totally go there. Like can you imagine how happy I am to know that one of the top liberal arts colleges in America accepted me for a fucking fly in, despite a shitty GPA  I mean... Seriously?! And everyone was like yeah you know, your GPA is really not gonna let you do much Yes! Dick calendar! I'll get you one and you'll get me a fleshlight Have you seen any of the Instagram stuff? My Carleton essay about empowerment is about how im capable of empowering myself by putting on a face of confidence and facing my shortcomings head on  Shortcomings or uncomfortable situations. Anyway have a great day, talk to ya later We played limbo like  times lol Like it has just come up a lot My roommate is freakishly good at it No my night was fun and uneventful I couldn't tell you any specific funny thing that happened but I had a bosh Blast My essays are some of the strongest things for my applications.

Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh Ughhhhhhhhh Uuuuggghhhhhhh Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhghghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I'm going into hiding from now on Catch you on the new year Loved all of the pics you sent!!! Especially wrong hole Why hiding? Yeah imma send it I saw the turtle thing that is my worst nightm All the pics I sent? Ona snapchat or Instagram? At first I read it as you having a nightmare about yourr turtle dying  Hiding so you can flourish You are a plant and I am the sun, e only I never give you time to breathe because my beams bombard you I can't believe you'll be in town for Aida! It's funny because when the rep for evergreen state came all the straight boys left lol Insta and snap When is AIDA? Was the rep punkish Last year they were genderqueer I did an acrobatics class toda I didn't go to the preseyntation, but this is what Joseph and I observed in class and we laughed for so !long Aida is Jan th and th I think How did that go, considering your flexibil! ity and everything? I've always wanted to do something like that, or gymnastics  I plan on running track or playing volleyball in college  Also sorry for not replying I don't really check my phone In the afternoon anymore because I'm not expecting responses haha Sunday,  Aimee, I hate the way I' m feeling I really can't do this anymore It is neither of our faults, but I c,rave attention that you are incapable of giving me at the moment and I feel tha  t it would be best if we focus on things in our respective places. I feel so alone all the time, no matter who I'm with, and it's not helpful when you tell me the same but make no effort about it It's unfair to the both of us Good night I am here to listen to any thoughts and solutions Hi Sorry I was asleep until just now Look, I don't have a solution and I would rather talk over the phone but Yeah, actually I really don't have a solution. I want to talk to you, I want to hear from you. Are you upset because we don't speak enough or upset because you feel me slipping away, or another reaso Both. You seem to be grandually becoming more disinterested in me with every day. And I feel like not t?alking leads to slipping away I feel as though I have maintained the same l  evel of contact more or less since getting here I agree with your sentiment, that not talking leads to slipping away. I am not more disinterested  thoug See that's where I disaghree with you Like I really feel like communication has diminished But honestl.y it's fine  Weekends are also the busy time of the week for me, but I see   what you are saying We saw a  year old man running shirtless out of the room across from mine at AM... Back and fo How was he allowed in thre dorms???? At the UA you need a pass to even use the elevator lol Or enter tthe building Last night I ditched Boy Scout boy and went downtown Also a clearh ly transwoman who was very passable came into savers yesterday and my coworker asked if she was a man or a woman Idk if you saw the chat but my mom asked if Carleton was like Pima  What's your day looking like today? I think he was a student... Just old looking  How was she clearly trans but very passable  Lol how did you respo Just the voice when she nasked for the restrooms. It's like looking at Caitlyn Jenner but then hearing hder speak. Today I am going to the street fair  Then work I said, Selina, 
 she is iprobably a transwoman but a woman nevertheless. Oh, to my mom Lol it took men a long time to explain that college did not mean community college and that ung iversity does not make an institution better than a college My family still doesn't get it but that's alright What does the street fair have to offer? Is everyone going? What did she say to Celinav ? Selina* Lol Grand Canyon University Do they believe you about Carleton? Never mind just saw message()/attachment.jpeg That's

 at brown What does the library look like What is your view from your room like She walked away to use the restrooms and Selina said that really loudly Idk why it takes you so long to open snapchat. It's bizarre. Today I worked and quit (yay), went clothes shopping for Minnesota, and hung out with some coworker Only the work was planned so I wasn't sure what my day would consist of Sorry idk they are very basic foods Not much to say I think he was just a brown student from MN Cute shirt color though I'll take pics in the morning!

In the past it's snowed during the program, and there are apparently wild parties for Halloween Alright well you're probably asleep and stuff, sorry Talk to you later   Haha, no I mean I think of you. It was a turquoise shirt, unusual for a college shirt. Did you choose the rainbow ensemble? I hear there is a lot of alcohol at Carleton.  How are you I ordered a andme kit lo?l !!!! That is actually incredibly exciti Hey How was your day? nWhen y?ou first used rainbow ensemble I thought you meant did I chose schools wigth a ? vibrant gay community, lol But yes, I chose the rainbow bodysuit for othe  r occasions. Not Halloween. It might come in handy for drag troupe club P I want to do a capella! Yeah I heard there was a lot of alcohol there too, and it's easy to go to parties on both the Carleton and Olaf campuses. We shall see. Apparently performance enhancing drugs are huge too I'm stoked for the an kit What if it turns out I'm like % native  Tell me about you I'm here Gonna get a beer Might act a little queer But have no fear Don't even shed a tear Because I'm not near You can send pics of your rear Ok I give up bye What Just got on phone lol What are you gonna wear for Halloween?

Oh shit, can't miss another homework then. What class was it for? Even if I'm % native I'm putting on my app, I just want to make sure What survey is this? Link? It's funny because I'm also applying to vassar (probably won't get in, slightly lower acceptance rate than Carleton) mainly because of their gay population Yeah, like pills to help students focus in class and for exams hahaha A popular saying is that Carleton students study hard and party hard Yay for rear 🍑🍑!!!!! I appreciated your snaps so much ) Aida is looking spectacular. Sonja is our costume lady, Cameron is the musical director, Brauer is the choreographer There are pirouettes and jumps and running in the dances  Can you believe I sing two songs all by myself And then for Not I'm a singing narrator  I think I'm just gonna buy a hat and drink for Halloween #college It's for basically calc AB.

I meant with Shawn Oh oh never mind Yeah I misunderst Yesm ! No! Maybe! What'os weird is how people move on  It's such a saddening thing It was beautifuol to see in action this week at brown. Bethany liked Adam, then Adam said he wad sn't into her, and hooked up with Rufaro, and now Bethany is over Adam.  Not that the names matter But the point is that it's empowering in some ca Lol well its empowering swhen there isn't much investment or when the investment was not worth your timee Other than that I can't argue for moving on Yes that's so t Only becauses
 I'm curiousr Have you slept with anyone yet? N That's no ? That's ia no. Corr Auh okay, I was just wondeering Bethany is Hopkins girl? No it'es cool, I goe tcha  Indee I didn't kncow she had thde time for hooking up St he's actually chill She's like Divit ya I mea.n like she is like Diviya without the Diviya mome Ugh I'm so upset becausAen I

I'll send you funny tumblr gifs and videos today I would be an RA maybe, I feel like it ruins social groups. Also super competitive to get in as one I did once when I was super drunk. I regret  😘😘😘 Hey how's it goinGg? Nika came out as trans and gay Fuck that I'm the one and only I went tor Yom Kippur services. Really damn good here That's actually so stereotype consi! dering Nika's interests  Wait how did that even happen Like public Hahahah Also I talked tol Joseph and he was super cool about everything and apologized. Really damn goody because of food or the actual services? Like you sat through a sermon? For us ? it's the day of atonement. Doesn't that sound so scary, even though it has a beautiful meaning? Yeah, the way she expressed it though was that it was more genderqueer than anything She started crying to Zayna in private after the Aida rehearsal  I stayed after to listen to some music and then Nika started crying in front of the drama teacher, byroad So she came out in front of me and Zayna and Zayna's brother and byroad When she was talking about her mom's reaction to the gay thing I started crying  She's planning on cutting her hair tonight lol In game theory we fucked around on buzzfeed doing the quizzes during an experiment, and Reyna got in trouble because she was doing Which Wild Animal is your Sexual Nature on the school laptop lol Are you planning to date her Jk Actual services, I know I am shocked too We call it that too when translated to English Gay thing? Wait wouldn't her mom just consider that straight and thus not problematic? Lol how did she get caugh Caught Which animal did she  Well she sits next to theg aisle so he could see her screen but not mine. She didn't get to finish the quiez lol. Yeah Nika and I are already a thing. I predicted it and jumped onto thatt
 ASAP Oh goodness. Is this going to be a trend? How important is your Judaism to you now? Not straight if her mom still considers her a girl How was that movie of yours? The intern? Awww remember our sex under a bush I can't focus on anything but devouring your 🌺 And pounding Oh as in Nika likes girls What exactly was said, I'm a bit confused I don't think Judaism is more important, but I really like the Rabbi. What she says could really be taken from any scripture  I missed it because services  Omg the bush I felt so nature If only you came in me that time, it would have been complete Pounding DDD ,  Ugh I'm so sorry I blam e you for not saying good night I love you, Aimee.

By that sentence I mean that life transitions and important markers became ones that I felt ashamed to experience. Like every kid should tell their parents about their first kiss and their crushes and who they like but I couldn't. I've forgotten what the holy days signify and it's been less than a year 😯 That's a poignant intention, and I like it. Doesn't quite come across  Lol is thAt a for real lawsuit?

 older people try to be trendy Noooo, it's not real. I remembered I told you In  would send funny things and I forgot to, so I rushed to find stuff According t to 
 the video At least % of pregnancies are Netflix and chill and % are Hulu and chill because Netflix has boring selections. The girl and some guy were watching an old movie and she got dick in her mouth, as she so lovely put it And you're not eating? I remember fasting the same day as you last year. Was it today? No I'm just joking don't worry about the video I am not eat I have to worry!!!!!!!!! Yes it was to Ok not really I'm in sucdh a fucked up mood right now I feenl like a crazy person W I got absolutelya no sleeph W It wasn't my faug lt thoughh!!! I took a nap at ish and woke upy
 at  Coulydn't fall asleep until  Woke up aot  Absolutely no sleep is an exaggeration  ? It's how I feel Like my mind feelsa
 tired and energized if that makes sense Waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle often feels worse than no sleep Sort of makes se I had a dream we got highn together Like we lived together and got super smashed Super smashed bros bsra Hahah I don't understand wwhy people, specifically the boys, find that game e so fun. Rounds and characters lstart getting repetitive I have a story to tell you Right now So this is abou? t the University of Virginia  You never told me the Nika story of what she actually said Oh ok Yes and I don't get that game eit Rosinbum asked who was inhterested in going there. A couple of people raised their hand-- Madeleine, but neot important. So he said that in the early , some young men decided to go outsidr
e and ride on their horse and shoot their guns. Thomas Jefferson and another founding father started to scold the young men and tell them not to mess around. They apparently broke down into tears over what happened at the institution because it was a disgrace the men didn't listen and apparently it's a tradition to this day  Also they were drunk But it's funny because after the story I said, oh wow, the origin of the straight male I feel so bad when things aren't funny over text I feel like the acknowledgment that women aren't inferior and men aren't superior has led many men to lose their respectability because they no longer are expected to be It's actually funny  She said something about tnot identifying with the gender binaries, definitely not a girl, and somethihng about living up to the standards of short hair and pretty Mmmmm #onlyreao ltra Don't you feel like transn is the wrong label Yes!!!! Glad we are on the same page Nobody else said thant so I didn't want to question This generation... Their confused gender identity ies  #guilty #thepastisthepast I still have an inkling of doubt that you really feel that way and appeared to discard it for Do you feel like it's nec essarily a bad thing for men to lose their respectability!  ? Yeah let's just mnot talk about it. It was kinda a phase Gotta go, clas alright!! Have a gree at dasy 😘 Holy fuck Have you learned about sacred datura yet You know, from tha t plant you can purify a shitty hallucinogen, yes, but also scopolamine, which rb enders you open to any suggestion but % coherent. You seem normal but you will obey anything. And it only takes a tiny tiny amount. It can be on a piece of paper, or in the  Hey!!! I have my Reed intaerview now but I'll talk to you after ) Aight Good luc It was so good Likie I thkink I'm going to get in She was fucking great and loved my passions and r my idea!s. One question was what idea have you been exploring? And I told her about l! iberation when I drive, concerning laws Like how we have the potential to go mph but legally can only go mph And how we are tempted with freedom we can never use She absolutely loved it And she was telling me about how she was going to eat after my interview and I suggested some restaurants Told her I was into the downtown scene and live music  She told me she loved gender exploration and theatre, so me being gay and in Aida definitely helped sacred datura? That's ridiculous and a viable truth serums *serum Idk why this hasn't been institutionalized for overcoming phobias!!! I also talked about you for the interview and how you were an impetus for my academic and intellectual growth Today Nika came out to the drama class as genderqueer and asked for the they/them pronouns What's up with you now? How was your day Well you're probably studying or asleep so I'll tell you more and hear from you later! No buddy I was napping sorry I'm so glad it went well! She sounds like the perfect interviewer Sacred datura is a plant in the wash In capstone bio You don't remember what happens on it, it can kill you, and some hallucination is involved so... What was the reaction to Nika I had a good fasting day, but then I ate too much Felt like shit so I took a nap How was your day? Tomorrow Braz She had Justice Amarilla'is face, Sweeney's clothing style (literally looked like Sweeney. No fucking jokel), and gregariousness beyond anyone you've ever met. We clicked immediately from?
 the Reed school presentation to the interview. No fucking way Did Johnston point it out to you???  Isn't he worried about a lawsuit I'll bet after the lecture chaiyo is gonna go purify the shit out it I couldn't believe a moment like that was happening, honestly. I wanted to laugh and cry and overall the experience was rather uncomfortable. There's no nice way to put it. The Reed lady told me that at student orientation, your pronouns are on your name tag lol I'm sorry ( I need to stop napping because I end up staying up until -am My day was lots of fun. The Aida choreography is super sexy and fun. I'm having trouble with my SRP though, but it'll eventually come together. Yes!!! Tomorrow Brazil ) Feel free to tell me anything about your day today. I am all ears. He did, but I saw a documentary and know it better now  Did anyone say a anything? How's the SRP coming? I bought  candy boxes  I ate the best bagel (cos I was starv OMG so in drama instead oif focusing on the play that's in less than a month (!!!) we are now going aroundn and giving compliments for half the class period.  People said she was bravg e
 for it. I said I loved how she made me feel comfortable on the stage and that s he's a great director. Also Garrett is adorable And Sam Nardi really has self ) esteem issues He's super hard on himself and it makes me sad What's the documentary called? SRP is frustrating because Pima has no social justice components whatsoever, and their Judaic studies program ended in  lol So I'm going to do a comparison of northeast schools  
 candy boxes!!' Why is that??? the French class was throwing a baby shower for Madame, but she had a doctors appointment that day and wasn't coming back to basis because she's super preggers So I got free leftover bagels lol Thanks to Vina   Yes I agree with all of those statements about drama people It's called world's most dangerous drug (vice) Why Pima? Lol make sure brown be on top It was on sale but somehow I didn't get the sale price?? With card  How preggers she be? Go vina gi Hahahah Is there a link ror can I just look that up? Again, college drama is terrifying for me The worlld seems to become so cutthroat  I chose Pima out of convenience lol... But it a  ctually sucked so bad She be preggers enough for maternity leave lol I can't wait to watch the movie with you tomorrow ) I'm sad though because I have no earphones with a microphone, only those clunky headphones You'll still be able to hear me though The guy in my family who killed the cat volunteers at a computer refurbishment center and got a free laptop and modem, so my mom is considering volunteering there so I have a backup computer for college Also she's like already wanting to go buy a refrigerator and all sorts of shit as if I'm leaving tomorrow I see you opened and replayed my snapchat sex hahaa ) Hopefully butt tomorrow http//www.vice.com/video/colombian-devil-s-breath--of- It's really not so bad.

 your ti Maaaaybe.. My mom invitedm my fluckil ng scout master over to talk about my eagle project WITHOUT TELLING MEe Lol l ok It's fine we can do on  or Sun This upcoming Sunday? Hodw was yo? ur day today? Yes this Sunday My day was interesting. I worked out! Waimpily My phage died on / plates but that's ok because it lived on on two of themy , both strains. Turns out we got two bad batches of bacteria from the lab I have no tennis shoes so I ran in converse Doug offered me his but they were ugly I just want a nicer back, is that too much to a That's awesome! I thoughts you judged me for cardio though and that was the reason why you never came with mke when I invited you. Hahahah did you take pictures of any of that? How can you ? tell that they're dead and what were you doing to keep them alive Lol I never came cos I'm a weak ass bitch But my back and legs hurt from walking around campus with a backpack all day so I need to work out I can send a picture of my back... So ok We knew there was likely a bacteria issue So basically You do these dilutions-- one plate is full () the next is ^-, then ^- etc. because you don't know how much virus there is.  we all did the ^- in triplicate with three different bacteria batches because it seemed that might be the issue And it was the issue.  My phage grew on the two plates from the / batch, but not the other batches  So the phage you can tell it grows when there are these clear dots in the bacterial field Because the viruses killed all the bacteria there()/attachment.j I meant a  picture of yourp phage Oh, I could maybe do that tomorrow... I'll see what I c an d Turned oute I didn't realloy meet with the guy He came over for a few but I 
 was free You dig dn't reply thoug.h so I didn't want to bother you Have you done a similar experiment in your time   at basis or no? No no Ugh that's too bad If you would have told me earlier I would have been able to do it tonight You should have totally bothered (wouldn't have actually bothered) me Lol no at basis we grew bacteria Now we are killing it By isolating viruses from the soil Which is MUCH more labor-intensive 
Basically what we did on  is take virus that was already growing on the plate, and put it on another plate to make more. We put the virus into some bacteria and then poured that mix into some hot gel, and then poured the gel on a plate and let it incubate I'm sorry to hear you are having a tough time this week Do you want to talk about I'm just so sad because e veryone already has their established cliques and people. Whenever I'm upset with ithe Zayna group for their bullshit (I can't even begin to tell you what's happenedt
 this week) I can't go to anyone because Diviya and Nate go off the moment lunch starts and Martha is in love with her boys I feel so lonely because nobody cares to bring people together the only person I could talk to this week was Sam Nardi What happened this week? Who are Martha's bo And I fucking miss not beying able to tell you anything  I miss you so much every single day I can't even sexpress that enough I think it's so sad that the group we cobbled together is ? fragmented What about Rey She often misses school bnecause her mom doesn't drive her and we don't really have classes together Maratha is trying to work  things out with Ahmad again my biggest fears are that you'? re going to not have an y time for me, or fall for someone else, or tell me you're not interested in talki(
ng to me. I know you say that things like that won't happen, but it's not unlikely. And I know that once I get to college later I'll be having a great time and making lots of friends, but obviously dealing with the now is very important to attaining the freedom of going where I want to go. It's not specific to this week, but it's a general sentiment of loneliness no matter who I hang out with It's a sentiment of admiring memories you will never make again with the people you're around It's a sentiment of seeing people you were so close to not give two shits anymore It's a sentiment of knowing that within months they will be faces in a yearbook And it's a sentiment of longing for the people I grew up with, who are now miles away It's my mother getting upset with me over not applying for scholarships (???) Anyway this is just really lame on my part and I'm sorry Excuse me I really need to find a better way to deal with this. I've been talking and hanging out with new people not at basis to ease up my life But I am glad to hear that you're doing well and making friends Zayna called me a pathetic and weak person, and said that her and others have no respect for me because I still talk to you And that she wants me to unfriend you on Facebook or else This was yesterday I really do understand what you are going through It is completely normal And I think there is a lot of added stress you have that I don't I think I dealt with it much like you did, with internal sorrow Not so much at the general loss But the fragmentati What's up now? How are yoou doing But thank you, I appreciate your help. It's a little strange because obvniously you're over the phase I'm going through.   I'm at a   party actually  I was gonna sleep But this happened Yeah I'm sorry, it's hard from the outs Oh ok well have fun Ok wiell I'll talk to you later then goodnight Sorry b ( Good night I hope we watdch the movie ASAP, it's unfortunate about tonight.

I thyink it's about a holocaust survivor working in Germany after she got plastic surgeory  Well that's good! I was hoping that it didn't mess you up yet Ok well I'll u be home around pm if I don't see the movie tonight 
 your time or my ti My time... And if I do smee the movie then probably pm my time Aright I'll plan for  your time then Died you see Aodhan's post?  I'm conflicted  She's not even on hormones in the lock? er room... I don't even go in locker rooms  Not that they should be yelling at her, but I don't know that I support her using the women's locker r I'm sorry! I forgot you toexted me Well it's a matter of comfort I think. Everyone feels different about thoeir body.  The reason I'm so comfortable with mine is because I value opinions abm out things I can change  Today I was actually seriously thinking about nude modeling once I turn  I totally want to help art and photography students in need of inspiration or models Oh shit Wow I didn't even read the second half of that text  Ok disregard that all Yeah, idk either, but that's touchy Can't discriminate but also want the girls to feel comfortable  Ok anyway Wait what did you think I sai I feel stupid so just igndore me I thought you were conflicted about yourself in locker rooms Ohhhhhh ?Lol How was your da Like I thought you meant yyou felt conflicted because she wa? s comfortable so why couldn't you be too? My da?y was a lot of fun. I'm currently considering the movie How was yours? Actually,?
 I feel bad about being so vague recently  Even though I'm usually not Yes I have been thinking about t I'm just coping  And I ghuess that means trying to detach myself  Today when we talk I want to chat aboaut getting you out of this cycle and how we can do t Because I feel like it's hgot nna happen and I was trying to make it easier So that we can be in contact, aand you can be ha It's pointless for me to pramble on about things that happened t when you won't even reply for hours I feepl as though much of your discontent stems from a fear that I will not talk to you y like ever and I won't enjoy your presence is my life, and that any time we don't talk much for a day it is representative of t I think that is one reasohn I always read it though I do get to it And it does matter to It's not a laot to do with  how often you talk to me, but whether or not you enjoy doing it andt
 you even likem me anymore * and if you I do enjoy it immensely It grounds me. I need There e have been moments w here I didn't feel wanted or anything, and I'm sorry for letting the small things iconsume me The reason I haven't been wanting to watch a movie or call you is prect isely that How can I fix that  In a realistic way How can I get you out of this cycle That seems to be a very negative force upon  I think it's helpful to jyust say what you feel Like express yourself to me no matter what time of the day oit is Alright, I'll try t To more when I have any free time But I don't get u like We call, it goes great, you seem happy And within  days it devolves Then eventually call again and fix things  Then continued devolution  How can we reach stabil Well this has a lot to doi with myself, but I felt that way when I texted you after school and you told me tto text you back in an hour, and then that you were still out so you couldn't. Thay t made me sad, but I feel like I need to get over that and move on because you need space Move on from feeling sad about things like that, I mean see that's hard for me beca Because you do need your ufreedom One one hand I want to text you, on the other hand things evolve and tsimes change, and I don't want to tell you I won't be free for  hours I just don'te
 think text is the best method for me anymore as it was in high school because Almost all of my time is spent with other people you know? It's rude to be texting  I love when you send me links and things and tell me about your day, but in terms of conversing seriously, phone is way better  Because my ability to text is all over the place (also it's getting cold and it is hard to type with cold fingers lol) Not to say texting is not good right now, it is because I'm free  You should go see the movie btw, it sounds wonder I already missed the showftime. I'm planning on going with people later this week though Kinda upsetting buut oh well ( Just a min -- didn't forget you I promise ( I made plans anticipal ting that you would go... So I'm gonna be busy here in just a minute Alri Oh ok then nvm Don't worgry about it I didn't go because I didn't want you to wait I wanted you to go h Shit No you can say what you want to say though I will read Ok I'm going at pmt What  were you up to Playing video games so not much, you finished the mov Yeah it iended a while agoi but I thought you would let me know when you were back So thatt 's why I didn't saey anything hahah What do you play? Lol I've just been aimless for a while. It? 's civilization , we have a unit group Was the movie goodb ? ,  After the movie I sat in  parking lot in my car and considered masturbating to get that piece of shit film o,ut of my head  It was called Queen of Earth Maybe I'm not a true artist or whate  ver to understand how it was reviewed the way it was, but it made absolutely no sense and relied on imagery to give details About some depressed woman who goes crazy after a breakup and her father's death, so she stays at her friend's vacation home and it's about her downward spiral The plan was to see that and drive to el con for The Intern but I was too disappointed  That's so cool that you found people to play with! Remember when you tried teaching me? Hahah Also, idk if you remember that iTunes gift card cal got me for my birthday? I bought a civilization game to learn how to play, but it wouldn't download because my internet kept crashing That's probably the worst review of a film I have ever heard I do remember! At black crown Awww! Is the Intern popul I wish I had fallen asleeap during the movie haha and I was so cold on the couches People got up and left! r Tbh I'm only seeing the intern because there's nothing else out  Also I've been ? meaning to get back to movie watching. I started Sleepy Hollow a few days ago and loved what I saw I heard Let's Get it On for the first time today How are you feeling, sir? When we talk I need to tell you the story of Martha's party  It was ridiculoussssssss Like two awful things happened I can't believe I never played that song for you What movies have we left fr I was thinking about thato today! That three floors up movie because of your bass lesson I'm still mildmly sick But overall WAY better Omg what's the sto And that one with Carey mrull? igan, far from the madding crowd Aww ( that movie was g Haha we said we woyuld comoe back to watch it  So story # I walk into Martha's house, everyone gree? ts me anod is excited to see me. Martha's parents come out from their room and invite me tod
 have food. As I'm dipping my pita bread into the hummus, Martha's mom starts with so I heard what you told Oscar... Goes on about how upset she is and how it was rude of me in literally the bitchiest tone ever And Martha's defense was my mom's insensitive sometimes. She doesn't know what she's saying Story # 
We're having a good time at the pool. It's Madeleine, Keizer, Carly, keagan, Wyatt and I lounging on the poolside chairs. Some kids come to the pool, ok cool, whatever, and their parents come along. after about half an hour one of the grandparents comes up and asks which one of us lives there. We point to Martha, and he says that she can only have  guests and tells us to leave Then Diviya, the smart ass that she is, tells me where is your social justice! This is teen discrimination. Tell him something So what do I do? I mean the guy was holding the gate open for us while drying off and barking at us to hurry up!!! Get out of here! Only  guests!! Of course I was the only one who told him off and he threatened to call the cops on specifically me Madeleine starts crying, Martha starts screaming, Diviya starts yelling at me and says I can't get arrested now So I just left the party early Then once I left people messaged me apologizing for the way they acted This was a mean old veteran man who took Martha's key from her hand to test it out to see if we didnt just hop the fence, and I called him out for teen discrimination  I'm sorry you're sick ( you have been under the weather for a pretty long time!  Good thing you're taking naps Also, I'm not exaggerating when I say Madeleine was crying... She started kicking shit and going bananas Anyway, those were two things I meant to tell you over the phone, but I hope the texts captured the emotion I was looking for ) Those are so riicul I also went to the farm tooday and guess who works there? Jesse Gilmer! He's missing teeth and he has long uhair now Super hippie  What do you mean she started kicking shit? This is sos
 suburban It's like portlandia but suburbia How did it end with Martha's parents? It totally was Missing teeth though Lol I thought the same th?ing too about suburbia!!!! I was gonna say only at community homes Like Madelei!ne started crying and saying I can't go to jail now! Who's gonna bail me out!!! M? y mom has no money! And ran around kicking trees in the parking lot and the walls of the community center Then she nearly kneed me in the balls Keagan and Wyatt and I couldn't understand the mass hysteria  Also I couldn't understand how fucking illogical that old man was Please never let me be such an asshole! With Martha's parents it ended with me saying well there's nothing I can do about it now. I'm looking forward to this year and to graduation Then her mom asked me how many schools I'm applying to, and when I told her  she said your parents must be rich Fee waivers 😛 Yeah, it's strange. He looks like a  year old bum Imagine rip van winkle  That seems so unreal Like wtf That's doesn't sound like real life  I looked him up! (I don't know who rip van winkle is) wow.... Not really sure what to say about that Especially Madeleine Not really sure referred to Jesse though Lol did you tell them about the waiv Her mom had her head too efar up her ass to even hear me lol typi I'm so pissed Can you sece the chat rlol You know, the personalities in our group are so bombast Oh I maeant it ass
 a questiion Like not a request  Haha you didn't know rip van winkle! l Lol oh well I ccan't believe Martha is defending you this ferven she quoted her dad on me t D  id his complaint result in any issue or anything for her parent Idk but thely hate me now,s which is fine Did they just find out about it n Lol no, they'y ve been upseot ?about it since summer according to Martha  It's times like this when you see wwh  at people are really like - my dad at breakfast this morning when we were talkin? g about this Yeah I saw that She's being super mean To you Even if I get her angle she doesn't need to be so mean about Like I can't understand w hy she can't see my motivations and the fact that I was drunk It's not like I goti joy out of telling him that I comforted him after it Idk it's the kind of tht ing that hurts all invol And while it was wrong inv some respects, I have no regrets Like yes it's the truth but it's not a consteructive tru He's gonna grow from it stomehow Maybe it made him work harder? Md aybe? But he was emotionally crush Ath least he didn't changee his major What are you still doing up haha? I'm just 
 laying in bed lol I sede what you're saying though, it's a trade Lol are you laughing at tohe arguments   I would be if I were watching this Interna It's like reality TVf lBecause roomy is asleep It truly I miss you It's weird  to see drama ff rom thle outs I missed cuddling next toi you during movies  It'is sooooo childish any d ridiculous  The other thing I'm dthinking is I enjoy Marths a and I'm overall not upset with her, but everyone tolere ates her ridiculousness and not mine?!? ( I miss cuddling in general, like spooning after part So girls do mature emotiionally way before boys! Huh Lol yeah, I can't even deal with this right now I ceuddle with people but they're only friends and it's not the same Can't squeeze bus tts ( I still love you  And I hope you've been having a good time Here's a scary video  🐻 Omg that video Omg Got dat fat ass I hope you are doing ok with all the turmoil Surrounding you Honestly I think you are more principled (American) and Martha is more practical (European) We talked about that this week in relation to burqas in schools, the Spaniard was hella pissed Anyway I hope you are having a good night I hope we are through this weird period we were having I hope you share how the drama and all else turns  even through the period moy feelings for you have not changed  My week is over. New cycle  Lol you need tou tell me about how that discussion turned out Aimee Do you still like me I feelt
 silly asking I want you in my life now and forever, I am so happy to hear from y Romantically? Currently o Yes Ed same I feel as though it's hard for me to categorize it as romance beucause so much of that to me is the physical presence- going to places, sharing a l! ife together, sex. I feel deeply connected to you, in a way that I think would be romantic were I to return at any po Yeah, I agree. Although fior me I'm fine without NEEDING to do those things to love you, because I know thatn there is nobody else I would enjoy doing with them more than I would with you.  t *doing them with  Anyway, thank you  Thank you, I'm glad we had a proper c 💖😊👻🍑🐢🌚
 too $ )h 🇸🇪🐢🍆🆒☀️🇮 Plus-sized yoga https//www.facebook.com/iloveklove/videos// a Have a great day 😘 WTFFFF My Uncle returns to his childhood street in Moroct co  years later  With his wife  Just saw a guy i n a st Olaf  That looks like a scene frtom a movie, it's so beautiful Where does he live now? Agh what's with all of thise Minnesota college love at brown? How was your day today? ) Even just reading St.e
 Olaf in that sentence gets me excited for when I go to Carleton  He lives in Jersulaem Jerusalem Idk I think they are the most proud of their state Like I know two Minnesotans personally  My day was very fine, straightforward class, virus died. Oh well When are you going aga Is telling a girl she's priobably compensating for something when talking about something big usually directedn towards her boobs? lol I know a Minnesotan too and she actually made it clear tha? t she was from there I'm going oct -st and I have my interview the th. They have a house specifically for fresh-baked cookies And we get to tour the arboretum  I'm going to the coffeehouse meeting thing that you went to last year It's at raging sage this year Awwww hahah too bad. Did anyone's virus do better or significantly worse than yours? Also it's funny because according to college niche whenever people get bored of Carleton kids they just go over to the st. Olaf events and parties Hm, Minneapolis has the th highest LGBT population, behind San Fran, Seattle, and Atlanta()/attachment.PNG()/attachme nt.PNG()/attachme nt.PNG Can you b elieve this!! Anyway hope you're having a grea t evening Just
 got out of UN, so rry! The president looks and acts just Kittl  es ()/attachment.jp  eg Will res pond m  ore in a sec Walking back Not clear what the boobs comment means Omg I tol d you the Carleton lady was from Uzbekistan right So it wasn't my fault, again Th  e bacteria developed a strong cell wall as a result of stress in all but one sample in our group so Surprised Minneapolis is ahead of Chicago And NYC unless you mean percentage wise Omg noooo on the te Just woke up haha Is thate the president of UN? He does!! Kittles used to be cute just like that back in the tday They share the same level of charm Yes haha and they meshed together because h he wasn't the straightedge science majors tend to be That's such an interesting experiment! It's funny how many of the problems were problems with the stuff you received rather than your doing Oh yes, it was percentage wise How has MUN been? Like are you an active participant in it? Lol he's chubby (not as chubby) like Kittles and same humor it's amazing  Yeah he's preside Did you see last night's bnlood moon  It has been ok... Like today was the first real meeting. I feel kindta inferior because they are mostly International Relations people who are super pol  itically knowledgable, and it was about the pope which I also didn't have much unique to say about but they forced us (mostly) to speak in small groups so I just sounded uninformed  It's chill tho And I am a director for their high school conference, on the Lebanese parliament (not one of my top ) I did, it was Kittles also used to be th at chubby. Today I was thinking about which one of my classmates will have beer belolies or just have a belly in general and which of us will still be attractive like k xochitl's dad Like general attractiveness later on in life I felt that way when I was in MUN too because your phrasing and solutions to problems seemed to be prepared things. Because you all had done it before you had things to draw from. It was funny because at the farm, Raad's brother was there (he's kinda doltish. Today I found out he got a % in a class) And one of the adults randomly asked guys... What do you think of the pope?? And Rabiah answered he's a cool dude. My mom talks about him all the time That should've been your answer! No but seriously I'm in love with him. He went to visit victims of sexual abuse, which included male victims!!! That's some of the first public acknowledgement I've ever seen That's awesome! Make sure not to write any stupid, suggestive notes to Lebanon hahah No no lol I am Lebanon  Like Ok I am creating the background guide  For the committee And like co-chairi See! I really don't get honw this thing works hahah 😁 How was your d Something about my day wasa particgularly interesting but I can't quite put a finger on it. I nearly finished myy Maca  lester supplement. Bella, all on her own, asked her sister to take pictures o? f the campus for me. That was a really sweet thing for her to do. 
In research class we read a pew research center article on immigration and when he asked for initial thoughts I said, what saddens me is that my grandchildren may not get affirmative action because according to the article whites are slowly becoming the minority. The class loved that comment haha Also we all failed th grade geography (well- Madeleine and I did) because we mixed up damn Mississippi and Arkansas and Georgia!!! I really just had so much fun today. Got to get my Doritos after school, which is always a great thing 
One frustrating thing though is that Keizer bases his future academic career around financial aid and not what the school has to offer socially or academically. Like at every college visit his only question is finances, and schools with the best package are at the top of his list Idk like for me that's one of my least concerns. We're all different though.... Sigh As you can probably tell, I had a great day and I can't shut up hahah 
For the school staff meeting today, the teachers had to complete a buzzfeed quiz (super credible? Am I right?) that would give them a color. They were then to group off because the quiz told them about their personality and then Ms. Paradis would lecture them on learning styles or whatever. It's just so dumb because instead of letting the teachers go home early and saying well, we have nothing meaningful today the admin decides to keep the date Also today Was dress as your favorite teacher day and Mr. Casler donned the best Wohlford drag Makeup, earrings, tank top, everythaang I actually have another story to tell you but it's better over phone or Skype Azealia Banks today on Twitter lol (according to Facebook news) LGBT community are like the gay white KKK's. Get them some pink hoods and unicorns and let them rally down rodeo drive. Ok I'm done lol Also Aimee I love pictures of any and everything!!! So please do send pictures no matter what LOL I thought I caused you to learn the states I think Keizer's method really makes more sense than anyone's because most colleges are going to offer a similar experience regardless. Cost is the differentiating factor Lol that's such a millennial approach, buzzfeed quizzes  She doesn't wear makeup or tank tops though? I'll try to think of things to photograph As my day goes on You day sounds so go Not as good as it would'veo been if you were here Jk lol  I mean not jk but jk in the depressing sentiment dI shouldn't have even said that because I was pretending to be all sweet and gushy ! 
Well, you caused me to learn CAPITALS! Hahahah. The south is always gonna be rough to learn, idk. The way I explained it to the class is that I basically just know of the west coast stages, the east coast, some of the Midwest, and then all the others I can't identify are racist  Which is pretty ignorant, but I'm working on it Well, he has some ultra conservative schools like hillsdale and then moderately liberal ones like Macalester. If there's anyone I can confidently say is even not ready for college it would have to be him. Lol i know right? Where are these millennial approaches for this year's class of ? Hmm? You guys got breakfast and assemblies and movie days and we get nothing because Chris and Elliot vandalized wohlford's house  Well it was a sleeveless dress actually, my bad. Still funny, regardless Okay ) Macalester is liberal AF  Which is so not Keizer Thtis is a direct quote from him When I grow up I don't want my children to go out. hI'm gonna be a fairly conservative parent. They need a strong catholic background o Lol you guys actually get nothing? It's so sad, it's clear that he has internalized his homophobia and is compensat We've had nothing. We havein't even taken class pictures... I really hope he ends up growing and becoming morne confident because it's gonna fuck him up soon if he can't His best friends are jg oann and vina, two of the most insecure and shy people I know I can't believe I just recognized that! Sergio's therapy skills  , ()/attachment.JPG
 today   Just realized wh()/attachment.JPG You'rea
 right though, he would be miser,a ble in college at this rate You look so tall andt  happy hah()/attachment.JPG    Sergioa You NEED new glass Just realized that h? e   onlye hangs around insecure people / Mhe Wire frames are so unflattering on everyone, yosu could be doing so much bettera !!  ! You are so cute already, why inhibit yourself()/! attachment.JPG I know I ? know hahah! Before I leave for MN I'm actually planning on getting myself some new?  glasses. I'll send you pictures and you can help me ) I've been wearing some of ? my 
 new clothes I got from savers. It's awesome because my mom was in the store and she also gets my discount, so when I was putting items away and if I liked it, I put it away (I went over to her and put it in her cart lol) Aimee omg I love you so much Even though you can't categorize your connection for me as romance anymore I am so enamored with you Ahhh!!!! 😘😘😘 I am so happy that you are so happy ) You're so beautiful ! ) You know it's weird  My thoughts about high school now Are mostly that I regr!et not taking harder classes  Wish I took AP Chem, Orgo, and more math Like how m! uch more work would it really have been And I'm sure I would have done fi Do you feel like what you nhave taken throughout high school has prepared you in any way? I agree though eI mean s I think you are someone caupable of being academically successful no matt  er what the circumstances are  We alrl know my regret haha My single high school regret  I think I could have been e more prepared. Like I did so little work, and I feared doing more for like no good reaso I've never worked as hard nin my life until this year But I know I can handle it I suppose the same is th.e case at Brown so far, but I am taking two hard classes because I care for them in  stead of because they were easy This year as in senior ye That's great! If you care aabout it then that's a lot better and more beneficial than just taking it because irt's easy Yes, this year as in senior year It's just a lot of projects and deadlin? es and responsibilities with school and my ECs Did I tell you I'm starting my eagle project ? I also need to boost the fuck out of this AIDSwalk because Michael is expecting a full sheet of volunteers So tomorrow I'm gonna go class to class I'm looking forward to it though There's always a reason to stress out about my life right now, but I can choose not to ) Which two are the difficult classes that you are genuinely interested in? Phage hunters and infectious disease  Math I'm taking cos pre-med. I really should be taking - levels higher, but I don't find math rewarding so I guess that's why I didn't take it in high school, but now I actually have more fulfilling ways to spend my time And computer science is kinda culturally interesting in a way I don't think a programming class would be, so I'm happy with it despite the fact that it's a bit of a joke What's your eagle project gonna be And how long is it gonna t I love how when I ask abouat your day you immediately tell me about how your virus did hahah Like of all thinkgs P Really the only highli Calculus is one of my favogrite subjects, but it'se
 difficult because what can one do with a math degree when hhe/she doesn't find science particularly interesting? What do you mean Like yout
 could do statistics  Or teachi Really! You have to tell mne more about this computer science class and about the Spaniard on burqas  Wheng we phone you will tell your story  And I will tell about M My eagle project Is k  inda aexciting. I'm building approximately  benches for the Tucson village farm, and thenn I'm bringing them on farmer's market 's for the kids to paint ) Each benchu
 is $ Wtf That's a lot Who pa Yeah... I have to do some yfundraising and submit discount requests to lowes and Home Depot When I imagine mysself in the future I can see some teaching involved But I also see so many other t? hings! It's difficult to pick one Just the other day I was thinking of doing a nude cultural photography shoot with indigenous peoples And how my body is no different from theirs even though I've had a western upbringing Like I was thinking about how I would raise money for this project and shit This was yesterday I think Another exciting thing to !!!! ) This guy down tdhe hall has come in twice today looking for my roommate's rolling papers  One was a min before our shared calc class That's actually a really good idea Like really y good I mean you would have to wait until you turn  but y Wow, I had faith in your reoommate and thought rolling papers was some academic college term you were gonna exaplain and then I realized how stupid I was jaha That's a great way to make $$$ Lih ke rolling papers was some paper kids took turns writing  What's funny is how much I judge people for doing avant garde art, yet I'm one of the biggest advocates for myself doing it  You should totally do that when you're though  LOL I'm would never Public ain't ready for that and neither am But what if this is the ga teway to selling your body!!!! Avant garden I actually like You start off byI selling pWapers and then you end up becoming a drug dealer and then on the streets    It's in athe bible, actually *Bible Ok no it's not Pretty sure it Maybe haha Reput blicans  say it *avant garden Whoops 
 I like avant garden actually as a term The avaint gar I ought to store that indidgienous nude project in my notes for later when s I have the resources  Good n es

Please get in touch with my agent if you can make this happen I think about that all the time Or I would call out ex boyfriends  L Call out my biological dadO I think about the shit I would do as a rich and famous person too Sex > mo WLhat would you do for me? n Or are you not generous enough I think about what I'd d  o for you Did you heare about the sex power God thing at brown (no longer exis Hahah no!! Please share!! y t Sounds very Diviya SexPowerGod is an annual Fall party, thrown by the Brown Quseer Alliance in the university's Sayles Hall, though in  the venue changed to Alumn)
ae Hall and again to Andrews Hall in . SexPowerGod, while drawing a large segment of Brown and RISD's heterosexual population,[citation needed] also draws a large gay crowd from a number of other New England universities. It was cancelled indefinitely by the Brown Queer Alliance in .[] 
The event is promoted across campus with an often controversial poster and flyer campaign. The posters took on a more graphic feel in , depicting sex acts and BDSM. Publicity featured actual Brown students for the first time the next year.[] Tickets are sold for $. The first set of tickets for  was sold out in ten minutes, a line of nearly  people remaining. Admittance to the event is limited by the -person capacity of Alumnae Hall. Until , tickets came as temporary tattoos that were applied on the body. In , some clever students gained admittance to the party with fake tickets, made from scanned tattoos printed on mailing labels. Since the  debacle, the tickets have been replaced by a guest list to avoid fake tickets and resale of tickets. 
In , tickets were sold for $ each over a period of three days. Ticket sales began at  AM, but students who want a chance to buy them typically spend the night in Alumnae Hall. This tradition of camping out to get tickets helps increase the anticipation for the party and guarantees that only those students who have a deep desire to attend are present. 
One source of SexPowerGod's fame and notoriety is its unique use of multimedia. Traditionally, partiers have been provided with identifying numbers upon entry, and a large projector screen publicly relays messages by number, typically comments on costumes and propositions for sex. 
On   SexPowerGod was featured on Bill O'Reilly's nationally televised, Fox News show The O'Reilly Factor. Jesse Watters, a producer of the show, gained admission to the   party and shot footage of the attendees.The following day, O'Reilly talked about the party on his radio show, The Radio Factor, saying, You would have been safer in Baghdad than on the campus of Brown University, and calling Brown president Ruth Simmons and other university leaders pinheads. On campus, student reaction to the broadcast was generally marked by outrage at what happens at the party mingled with pride at being featured by O'Reilly()/attachment.PNG Awww my d. ay keeps getting better That sounds mad crazy Can't believe it's that huge of an[  event What exactly is the purpose though?

I wonder what the hungover eyes actually look like. Is trhe Keizer one the guy who commented on trans people? Ok enjoy your nap! Talk to youe
 later bb ) Lol the eyes aren't the problem, it's that when you are hungover you are often sensitive to light No... What comment on trans people?  #brown sitting next to two black peoples talking about how brown revoking cosby's honorary degree is race relat The religious guy who said ethat trans isn't a thing or whatever Lol that's rape related How silly I'm with Ddiviya and Nate right now because she locked her keys in her car Diviya oh... I feel 
 like my cervix is breaking What's up with you How was your day Hey I'll message you in like an hour, I'm working (been working for hours at this point l That's alright! Have fun haohaha Hi! I don't recall the religious guy, but this definitely isn't him. I thilnk you mean my floormate Jake, who isn't very religious, just Floridian  He's recov) ering though Did she figure it out And why was her cervix breaking  My day was fine, I did a lot of work I didn't need to do.  I'm  weeks ahead on math HW, and now I just need to go back and check the answers (I don't like quotient rule, I just use product rule in its place, so my answers are a bit wonky) It's a humid hell here I worked out (mildly) I biked  miles (slowly and without high resistance) and then did some torso exersizes  Exercises* I napped for hours in the middle of the day which was beautiful And I did some phage homework  So all in all it was a good day  Wbu? ,  No no there was someone you  told me about your first week at brown who was anti trans Yeah we had to wait for ,the AAA guy to come. Her cervix nearly broke because she didn't want the guy to scra  tch her car, and the tools he was using made his work look dangerous Ugh god I miss calc homework so much! That was me last year!! That's awesome!!! Does the video game format help you stay motivated to work out? Your day sounds glorious Like all of my favorite things Sleep and exercise and working (Fun work though) 
My day was actually super frustrating because my back hurt all day from shitty sleep, I didn't feel like going to school, the Carleton rep gave such a bad presentation, I performed horribly in drama and after school drama, and everyone was being bitchy today except for a few people But I'm still pretty happy because I'm going to get through it Yeah that was jake I'm pretty s And I'm gonna get everythinug done We talked the first week Why was the Carleton presentation bad? My backr hurts perpetually more or less What happened in drama and who was bitchy? The vide eo game format does, I guess. I actually think so, yes What is due so The thing is that I've neveor had shitty posture and a bad back until recently Rep showed up late and we only hnad around  minutes to ask her questions The Hampshire rep was a mess!!! She moved t?
o Amherst a month ago and knew literally nothing about the school. Grew up in Maine and went to school in Ohio. when someone asked about social sciences she said yeah social justice is big on campus... Is that what you meant? Well in drama I just wasn't on my game. Being off book was so bad for me today even though I knew my lines. And I didn't feel like singing so I sounded bad Chinese quiz , CC survey and spreadsheet due tomorrow 😦, game theory hw , bio quiz  and paper , drama/AIDA shit, AIDS promoting, eagle project and merit badges Omg those sound like AWFUL presentation  That's actually quite a bit of work! I just need a mattress pad. The bed sucks Bad posture? Y I know!!! At least my last oday at work is this  and I can focus on all of that and the farm  I'm off aull next week ) Are those available for purchase? Like can you get one if you want t? o? Haha shocking, I know. Didn't even realize how bad it was until the drama teacher told me and suggested I try stretching again  Yeah but it's expensive and shit. I might tho.  Anyway b I am sleeping now so Goodnight! AND WORK ON YOUR POSTURE BEFORE YOU END UP A HUNCHBACK LIKE Ok but listen to the song M agnets by Lorde!!!!

I am great! Though I am a bit stressed for my infectious disease assignment, but I'll finish it tomorrow. I didn't realize that people don't all get good grades on those, and I might as well just be lucky to have done so well so far It was a big export, and the brown family was involved. They made  proof rum and shipped millions of gallons to Africa  Until the molasses became problematic to get In the early th century Omg how is SAAF Tell me lat What's the assignment?

I am meeting with the main designer this weekend, but serious work starts in like  weeks, and it opens in  weeks Today I went to class and then rested because it was an early class Now I'm working on reading some papers  
I corrected like  weeks of math homework yesterday, did  weeks worth on , and some phage homework. Now I'm doing Infectious Disease stuff that I've been putting off, but it's due on  and I prefer to not stress over the weekend so  My virus seems happy! I'll try to send some photos tomorrow when I'm at the lab How are things socia Yes, right now he's teaching lan th grader Griffin and he's teaching Casey. Shit you have barely any time to do it!l!! At PCC for the play Reza was in they had to know their lines solid in two weeks. Iy
 read an interesting article about what it meant for politicians to duel in the -s Primarily focusing on Hamilton and Burr, and the morality and mannerisms back then I'm still reading it though. It's like  pages You seem to be really productive though, I'm so proud of you Socially is great! I always have people to go to when I'm lonely. Last night Reyna and I had a blast, pretending the paper bags Michael gave us were packed lunches I don't feel lonely anymore I love everyone in drama except for Zev because he fucks me up during dances I went to ask the straight boys, who huddle together in a corner in game theory, if they wanted to participate in the AIDSwalk and they gave me such stupid answers They acted like it was some huge joke and they were like ummm... I play video games on Sunday GriffGri Awww you know him!!! He's hilfarious Where did you find the article You chatting with Reza? Ranya Btw Joseph fwanted me to tell !you that nothing he said was meant to be harmful, like about making!
 your face and stuf!f. The reason I got upset though was it was just insensitive. My analogy was going to !
an anti-Israeli conference and him saying you're doing so and so right now and you look Israeli, knowing that the people around would react violently. It was insensitive. But he got upset with me for telling you and wanted me to clear things up. rosinbum gave us the article yesterday. He gives the most interesting articles about things I otherwise wouldn't be interested in, sometimes science-related My mom actually chatted with Reza lol when she went to see the play Reyna said she would love to be my lifelong friend because we can go a long time without seeing each other, and when we finally do it's like no time has passed She went to see his play?? Yes that's how I feel about you and Reyna Yeah I chatted with h lol reserved for cis vans Doies each house have their own eating area? Hahah yeah, weird huh? He invited me to go msee it but I said my mom and brother would instead How was your day today? I got the

We drank at the college radio station, then went to the crew (rowing) team's house where there was like a real dance party Like good music, dark, cool lights lots of people actually dancing and giving no fucks 
the lady got stabbed last night while her husband was murdered. In her testimony she said that she ran through the street with the knife in her shoulder screaming for help and that the Palestinian shop keepers clap their hands and wish for her to die. Abbas the moderate this week There's a guy on my floor who is apparently of the third richest family in New Zealand. He's cool but low-key judgey about everything  Lots of kids here like that All the international kids almost goddamn They are wealthy AF some aren't most are Kids of CEOs, things like that A famous rapper from South Ameri I think Sophia uses male pronocuns because someone referred to him/them as her boyfriend  My coworker came in to waork from a party last night and she doesnt remember anything, only that she got into a 
 car accident Ummm you have to take a picture of yourself in those. I'm serious... Because I actually can't believe that You in jeans is like me in basketball shorts and a tank top  That's a normal female assigned at birth gender queer thing  Wtf She was driving drunk? They are in the wash but I will eventua Also I'm not ignoring you but lI'm kinda busy so I'll text you when I can ) Hey How it How were you able to drlink at  the college radio station hahahah? Is there any sort of application discriminy ation agdainst international students? Like why is it usually the wealthier ones who end up ino
 the college I watched a horror movie, Goodnight Mommy Lol they had a party there Like they bought all the booze and cups and everything  And two of my friends here work there so they were invited and brought us Also there was the super serious student BASIS Scottsdale girl  I think they may get less financial aid, like not % need met but I'm not sure But also because the kids who can get their applications to fit foreign standards often go to (private) international schools or private schools geared towards American colleges  I do know one poor South African girl  Sorry I'm not really busy or atnything but my head hurts so ya  I tried napping and then started to watch a movie, ahnd I ended up eating lol The super serious BASIS girl went to the party? Yeah, I waso
 thinking that it had to do with their focus on those schools and that they were in programs geared towards American admissions  
When I was working yesterday and elderly lady came in and was being super bitchy to me, and luckily she forgot soon after that, because she started asking me personal questions. Then she said, hmm... AIDSwalk and theatre... Are you gay??? Obviously I hesitated because I didn't want to start anything and have her scream at me 
after I said yes she was like good for you. Good for you for being out like you are. I grew up in rural Indiana and gay people would have been killed. You have so many opportunities and you're so lucky. Go get educated and be gay. Then she was telling me to be careful because these days on grindr I'll never know who I'm meeting with and the guy may want to hurt me Also something that happens frequently at savers is that customers ask for our numbers, and yesterday some frat boy asked my friend for her number and she was super excited about that 
During my free period I was outside practicing lines, and zellmer came out and was like oh, señor, I was just coming to check on you. What are your plans for fall break? I'm going to Minnesota to check out Minneapolis as a place to live   And when I told him two of my top college choices were there he immediately was like, we should meet up and have lunch sometime if you end up there Pretty cool dude Sorry, it's just that earlier I wasn't in the story telling mood and I was so busy driving around and stuff Hope you're doing well I was kinda pissed off because Richie was home and I wish I had stayed out all day instead of coming home He had my mom buy him a shirt with weed leaves from Spencer's, and then he realized today and had to go return it Also Alex came home saying that his dad's girlfriend abused him so now the police are on their way Yeah, it's not that I thought she didn't party it was just a juxtaposition.  How did AIDSwalk come up?? It would be so weird/cool if you both ended up in MN How often do the police co He would tell me about all them tail he's getting and I would tell him about my studies He was like you're gonna neeed lots of layers for the Minnesota winters! And Zayna interrupted with, that's not ? our forte and he looked at me and raised an eyebrow  Lol when I tell people what I've done they're like but you go to basis!!! You're not SUPPOSED to have a life She was asking what I'm looking forward to this month Police come at least once a month  What's up with you? Lol or possibly the reverse  I'm just studying, and napping  What have you done at basis you tell them? I am so happy to be working on two shows One of the shows will only have lighting set up time from PM-AM every night for a week... I tell them about our parties .and that I'm not a virgin and they're shocked Urinetown and what else? To custome.rs Lol I have friends outside of ?savers omg I have realized that our parties hab. its are not normal for high schoolers  
 apocalypse Anyway, I don't work there anyemore Uhhhh are you ready for that com? mitment? Yeah, I realized that a long time ago.s What's sad is that Jay says going to something without alcohol isn't fun. The freque  nt drinking is what isn't normal, not really the parties themselves  What's  apocalypses? Why wouldn't I be? Idk lol I haven't gone to any meetings yet ( Jay's habits are so unhealthy And it upsets me how his extremeness normalizes our behavi It's not only his drug use ando stuff, but he refuses to stop being sad over Elizabeth and talks to her all day, inclruding during class He cried when we were trying to take the phone away from him And   drinking is certainly not the right way to deal with loneliness  It took less time than expected for me to get over you And I'm usually the one with the strong emotions and capricious tendencies People now think of our grade as heavy cocaine users when it's literally just jay Anyway Do you have a pic of me with the blonde highlig Idk I wasn't sure if that was hsomething you would be willing to do. Seems like something I wouldn't do Why?? Dotes he drink during the day? Yes but I feel as though you are more intense but for sho? rter periods I just want to show t Is it for a boy  Because the honly picture I have is of us and I don't think that's something you'd want to show lole Sorry I didn't forget about the Latin Jazz music videos but things are a bit weirm d between me and the girl who filmed it  Lol no it's for Beth Ok then The two shows are aat different times One is in , the other a month la()/attachment.JPG She nhas het ard a lot about you h Good or the bad? What kinds oaf things do you say I ry emembere  a conversation we had I was tutoring at Chai's house hand I was in the basement in r th  e bathroom And I texted you what will we say to our na ext boyfriends about each other? And we talked about that He does not drink the day, but it wouldn't surprise me if he started to Good of cour Why are things weird with the sgirl? Just like about you and your family and journey and our friendship history eI recall vaguely that it was important to us to emphasize and talk about all the posit! ive aspe You tell her how im gonna pouncd the shit outta ya the moment u get back here boi  Jk lol Or am I....? 😦 She tthinks I like her and am secretly straight because I was drunk and lacked coordination s and touched her boob But just a graze not a grab Yaaa We are going to do that, of coaurse ? Absolut Hahah oh boy Our friendship heistory I was thinking about that athis week It's just absolutely fucking insane how Il went from completely hating you s to loving you more than anyone in the whole entire uny iverse Like we were mortal enemies  On the brink of being eternal ones if it hadn't been for Reza  Reza brought us togethe Yes, the positive aspects. Her's the one who told me you hated my pants so I confronted you about it Right hahah?ahahahah Half checkered half black Lola wow if that bitch who thinks you like her sa? w me at the parties with all the girls shhe would think we were in some polygamous relationship  I feel terrible for making outa
 with Madeleine  It's something I refuse to acknowledge happened My journey lol Now that I don't have you to talk to all the time I fear that I've lost IQ points  You did what? I Hahahahaha I thought I lost IQ points But I'm actually doing fantastic in my hard class Like definitely the top student and the only first-year But it's mostly because I'm super familiar with the subject  It will recover I assure  Do you feel like there's an egyo problem with brown students that kinda conflicts with work ethic and desire to learno? It's weird to me that this year (and every year) I'm experiencing things you've gonu e through  Not at all, they mostly just have inferiority complexes  Eh, in college it isn't linear you k Like I'm not being challenged nfor shit Same This year is such a joke. A ma.jority of my stress derives from my oextracurriculars I can't believe how quickly y.ou have gone from being behind to nw ot being challeng My only tough class is game et. heory, until I start the homework an hour before it's due an get an A or B+ Like I pdrocrastinate hardcore because it's bullshit lol no, you can't say same... I am   done with all of my homework until next !!  I submit everything ASAP mostly No I can beca Does that mean you'll have movuie time D Or we can talk time haha Also I've stopped giving a fuck about having peopsle edit my essays In fact, I've decided to do it all independently  I no longer sende
 them to anyone and I work on them and edit them as I like 
My lab class is just lab, it's nothing hard. My infectious disease class isn't material I know strictly speaking but it isn't hard, and there is nearly no reading. My math class I took in th grade, and my computer class is a joke more or l It makes everything easier e Yes we can do that! Lol I never even re-read my essays for grammar et You were goinsg to tell me abouct computer science haha. I wrote down things you told me you would ts ell me about. (I'.m not obsessive, I swear) It's just a bad habit What's funny is how you can take the  se kinda difficult classes, end up with a degree in biology, and make k I've also started reading Catcher in the Rye Tell me other things I said I would tell you about? Like this week the assignment was to create an excel spreadsheet.... With charts and s Burqas and the Spaniard guy Whestern vs. European ideals But later we will be doing HTML and Python. Still it woin't be hard Hahahah Oh god, I found the poems I toald you I would send every day butt

Create an excel spreadsaheet... And you get a grade for that? I mean like its a bit more than that Some dhata analys Still can't get over your poliitics class/teacher haha But nothing sera ious, it took like no t How fucked up is tshat???

Thhey are pushing harrd for minority professors (this is factual) and she is black and thaey don't want to  let go of minority professors without serious serious grievance s Hit s bas Oh yeah, definitely I think tehat applies to elderly and minority teachers Elderly? Do you listen to Dolly Parts It's a stereotype for administoration to feel bad about letting go of elderly teache? rs  Oh, but that's usually ifn they have long been th The Spaniard guy's reasoning feor the North Korea thing S? he is new, relatively  Oh ok that's what I assumed you rme Lol I once suggested a Dolly Paarton song to you His argument was  Oh Like oe ne of my favorite songs They anren't rebelling, and thus they don't mind Por que! And that it doesn 'ty matter it f they are brainwashed  Or repressed I was just listening to  There's noita
 enough traction fohr rebellions like in the Middle East? The concept of democracy it sn't as ubiquitous  eOr understood Did he take into consideration the power of censorship? Not quite. r
Rather that we are justified in middle eastern nation-building because the people want it, but that the people there clearly support their government no matter the mass deaths and poverty that are present and thus all is good. And I said the same was true in Nazi Germ There's a different mindset thaere when the people feel powerless and that there are superiors It was not a nuancned argument from him He discarded it and said if they truly cared it would change. Thy y censorship is irreleva Lol sounds like a Jay to me Wnhich folly Parton sting *dolly Parton song did you hear That's such a stupid argumentt oh my god I will always love you and of course Jole Those are the two songs I s  uggnested to you lol Long ago of course I have to listen to them now Even though she caen't carry the notes the way Whitney can, her voice against the music is so nice I thi  nk that country music expresses emotion really well Like no matter what they're saying, it's better than some music with deep lyrics  They make road head sound like a candlelit dinner with intense eye contact  They - country singers Not that it doesn't feel like that already ;P We have chocolate chip cookie slices and brownie slices which are slices on the smaller end of normal pizza slice size  Like they make massive circular brownies and cookies It's awful It's like they intentionally cater to stone Oh I thought you were gonna sary that they were trying to keep the freshman  alive hahah Picture! Sergio has never sseen a cookie so big Sorry I was chatting with rookie Roomie A his friend from h  ome lives on our floor too and wrote a book upon which a new HBO show is based The Leftovera I like her voice a lot though Leftov I looked the book up and the aeuthor is a  year old man lol?

Lol no I mean  I began to I enjoyed the concept But the range of genres that can capture my interest through completion is narrow I thought, from what I had read, that you would enjoy tho (Anything written by a scholaru, lol) Catcher in the Rye is probably the most stereotypical coming of age novel lol g Like  Child oh I'm feeling things Dad read this  I really only do biographies, dyh stopian novels, and books of opulence (Dorian Gray, Gatsby) Hahahaha Anyway I'm gonna cr Have you read slaughterhouse faive?

Well they ewere like so we can ! geat them out right now and I started panicking and getting all sclared And I said I didk n't feel comfortable without going under What have you done todal y? American Pie is so incredibly sexist lol... Today I went to two classes, killed it in ID and figured out my calc prof is trans (I knew it!), went to an advising meeting which went well, then resolved an ID card issue. Now I have lecture in  min for . hours  It's super sexist lol that's the point  What have you done today? Yeah remember the story  I also have no homework, but I need to work on reading Urinetown tonig How'd you find out about the cahlc professor???  OOOH what lecture are you going to today? Take some notes etc. It have a model UN meeting  See, I thought the movie was juast something to appeal to th  e straight boys and justify behavior  It's not really pointting out anything and criticizing it Also might go to a free documentary screening   about the Miami gay community at  Oh it's just for my phage class Just like normal. We have . hour lectures from hell each Mon That actually does sound awful.d I have a friend at Pima who has  hour math classes But it does represent common soacietal occurrences. It isn't a social commentary, but why is that necessary  Lol well y I suspected about the prof I had ESPN about it (mean girls reference) Why aren't you in class And I looked her up on FB and she posted about trans rights a  Today I went to my dentist appotintment, went grocery shopping, played with Alex, read and worked on essays, read my boook, and now I'm watching American Pie. Super super busy week though so I'm relaxing whin le I can ( Fall break!! Lol you're the one telling ME aboutan Girls references? Bitch I invented them The moment I saw ESPN I knew you weren't talking about sports  I'm curious to see how the gay community in Miami is represented  
Her voice is super perfect though, she doesn't look masculine AT ALL. The only weird things to me were her bizarre fashion sense, narrow hips, wide shoulders, slightly unkempt hair, and that she is a female math grad student. No one else knows at all  the reason I was so excited to twatch a movie w u is because I have no hw Omg fall break Oh I also picked up a prehscription (other side of campus like . miles away fu What does her being a math gradc o student have to do with being trans? Although It's a stereot A lot of the Mills kgirls are ecyonomics or math majors Math, computer science, and sometimes physics a) re super tranps woman subjec Lol I could run that in  minutets Maybe  Lol it's - today and evere yone is all bundled up and I'm in a rolled up slseeve button down like bitch I'm from Arizona, we tolerate the weather unlike you bitch  I looked up the admissions rep ewho called me from Carleton and she's a black Smith graduate One guy here can run as sub- minute mi Volleyball team captain at smitlh  Mile So many people here are r unn But I mean she sounded super wheite... Iet's so cool regarding Carle And like  years old. She's probtably like  r I think ths ey are looking for kids like you, all liberal arts colleges thoese days are s I mean you're right about mills but given the other factors it was a consn iderati Lol exactly. I rarely ever put oon layers. We take it like real southerners!!!!! Ok I'm joking btw I would never say nthat Which part Like I'm not even cold out th I want to be a runner or do somee s  port for fun! PE is a Carleton requirement, and that could be yoga class or broombalrl or ice skating kids like you What does that mean?

Fuckkk I was telling my mom how upset I was   over the refugee crisis  And she was like well there's nothing we can do about it. You should start locally if you want to make a difference and change the world. Look at this website And she pulls open this website where I can send a letter of encouragement to axican child  Lol Hahahahahahahahaha Not what I was looking for, andh I probably won't take it Oh that's so your mom I just found out about a class calhled the biology of AIDS, I think it's next semester and it's so exciti She had axica an child pen paln before I was born, apparently Damn you!!!!  Things like that interest me and I'm notg even that fascinated by science  My time is near I will be blessed with opportun ! ities soon  Y To take the classes I want to teake I love my biology classss C las I have an interview with the Casrleton rep on smy second day so I hope I kill that? Also I really hope I like the schoole Brown is!
 the best and I love I would hate to have these high  expectations and ths en be disappointed  I hope you do too Brown seems like a greati school!, actually  I'm glad you're having fun It's fucked up to me though That lt ike we g!et so much privilege over the greater providence commun One of the reasons why I've st! oipped missing you so much is because I know you're enjoying your time Police don't ctome on campus, just campus police, who won't arrest students ever.  No matter what druy gs or anything else you do nothing will hap What I think is so fucked up isp that I'm deemed unworthy of matriculation to those institution and connections becausee of my past It might as well be Amsterd *imstitutions Hahahahahahahaaha Imstin tuti Ugh lol I'm glad you fee thoat  You know what I'm saying Anwd myes it is fucked up, but you can transfer if youn want to! And also you can find thesa  e opportunities in upper division classes everywhs e Lol hey Aimee... Er... Emmett!r I'y m a Brownie Brown is just blessed to have them for us first years  W Peek-a-eboo!

 sounds hideous! I waoultd be so happy if you did end up here because I know you would love I feel like I wt ouldc too actuall y Yesterday I was considering visiting campus just to visit Sometime in h the near futuire You would be welcome to my r As a part of my college researcoh process I look at t all of their Instagram and Facebook stuff And brown's are just so ofucking cool They have a Humans of Brown thing and I was laughing on my bed reading thm em What are they li They seem like such average peokple And they are Lol this week there is a popular seminar (hundreds going) on cisseex Which is why I'm so upset with imyself and the systems in place that lock me out? Our daily blog is basically. Browns-themed buzzf This all makes me resentful yete hopeful As much as I hate it I crave im t Lol I feel like minorities just hate everyonee who isn't a minority  That is fostered by tum Cis sexism is such a sad concepbt d ^^ yes Can you send a link to the daily blog??? Would you be okay with me transferlring to brown lol I would! Sorry I was in class  Haha thr at's okay! I'm making soome vegetable fettuccine Alfredo with spinach and tomato How was it?()/attachment.jpeg m It's soooo go od Also the how was it was for you, not referring to my food lol Ok re/ garding gun law s; I know that I was all for freedom and nd right amendment and whatnot, but don't you   feel that heavy regulation with freedom on hunting grounds (with the power to divvy up hunting weapons to people with background checks) could solve a lot of problems? I just really feel there is no way for sure to know who you're selling a gun to And a matter of mental illness isn't enough of an excuse It was ridiculous He condensed . hours of material into an hour Ok but how can that coexist Like take their guns when they leave the hunting groundV ? And what about protection of the family, the main thing people say they need guns for I just think mass shooting is unavoidable given the circumstances and not a real issue. It's not at all common, but the media makes it seem like it Have you had any quizzes or exa ms yet?? No, my idea is that the hunting grounds would have guns that people check outi for the day and return later. Without a circulation of guns, the only thing American fs amilies would have to worry about is knives and potential firearm contraband. Why are robbers afraid to invade homes during the day or when people are home? Awww omg American Pie taught me that girls are complex and not just something I put my dick in Lol no none But criminals will retain guns... Lol is that sarcasm regarding American p When the criminals are arrestedi their guns are possessed and melted down so we can improve infrastructure  No... I leearned what it is to be a man after that movie.. How to love like a man And how to fuc? k like a man What's up with you? You gonna go see that gays in Miamiovjoe? *'iami movie *miami I mean yes but that's never perfect at all, and not particularly realistic in the political climate. Not even dems would touch that Hahahahaha Lol I was curious and went to the cissexism thing and I wanted to slap the whole wo Well then I guess I'm gonna havre to be a MAN about this and steal dem motherfuckers guns myself, eh? I guess I'm gonnla have to be touchin it. Getting my hands dirty for 'merican safety!!!! Omg you need td o tell me about that I would probably stand up and start flashing my cis privilege all over the place, but then I'd be excused cuz like I'm gay andxican and poor  What even is an argument for cissexism??? Like I rationally cannot think of something  Maybe that's my privilege speaking though What do you mean an argument for it Lol it wasn't like that but it was ridiculous. Such hypocrites  Like here there are so many things said for the sake of political correctness but never implemente Well like that cis people do sodmething worthy of condemnation  Did they acknowledge that it's not conducive to anythi ng  No no That wasn't it at all Like that wasn't the point at all They basically 
 meant transphobia or how things are unintentionally inconvenient for trans people. But it's called the ism series so they called it cissexism instead of transpho What did you think of the seminbar itself as a trans person Did you agree with anything Also can I just say I know uinderstand why you thought Oscar was ugly In a very very nice way I didn't really aa gree with like any of it It was all so out of proportion One alright bit was called a day in the life They spoke about how some everyday scenarios might play out for a trans person Or the interview with Janet mock asking the cis lady invasive questions  What do you m Did they focus on both sexes foer this? And then we get to the other thing that low key pissed me off It was % traans women explain the cis lady invasive q uestions thing? And % of those were blackn , % Lat Yeah, I kinda figured that woulid
 be the case I feel like there isn't enough FTM representation There are WAY more ftms at brown than  Lol I'm laughing so harda AlthoMugh I'm really sorry, because I usually ask you those questions but it's not because I Tthink that's all you are I just value our communication and feel that we are comfortabF le enough with each other to where we don't need to restrict ourselves when it comes to it So I hope I haven't bothered you with that Well the really hot thing right now is MTF, so I don't think they're taking the population into consideration  Lol even though she's a relative moderate she's more easily offended by far than I am It's because MTFs are more oppress Well I mean how much more likeley is it for an MTF woman to be attacked or harassed or raped than an FTM man But I undderstand where you're coming from, too 
 Something super weird is happening w my phone b e I just updated Anyway yeah I take back anything I said about Oscar being attractive Have you told your roommate about yourself? Lol no and I don't plan to Pretty sure he figures I'm gay though Ok sure but some basic lip service Would be appreciated  He's weirdly Chubb Chu Oh!!! You watch lip service toob!!()/attachment.PNG Ah see I thoug ht you two would've had a push-up contest and then byou took of your shirt, forgetting a bout your scars, and he found out Or like he walky ed in on you changing shirts  He   wouldn't kn Know what it means Like he really truly would not know. I've found that people really never ever assume trans In any context Ever Scream quee I mean the only reason I do nown is because I know the signs  Wait Have you seen scream queens? No but I want I ssaw the first episode and it  sucked lol Real Like it's actually sooooo bad lThey?
