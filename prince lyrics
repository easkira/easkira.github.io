Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today 
to get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell u
There's something else
The afterworld

A world of never ending happiness
you can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
you know the one - Dr Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

Because in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
u're on your own

And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy - punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around u
At least you got friends

you see I called my old lady
for a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
Sex, sex is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no Let's Go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited 
But we don't know why
Maybe it's Because
We're all gonna die

And when we do When we do
What's it all for What's it all for
you better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

C'mon baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah
Crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Go crazy

I said let's go crazy Go crazy
Let's go, let's go 
Go 
Let's go

Dr. Everything'll be alright 
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and dafodills will kill
Hang tough children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Take me away!



Take Me With you

I can't disguise the pounding of my heart
It beats so strong
It's in your eyes what can I say
They turn me on

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with u

Come on and touch the place in me
That's calling out your name
We want each other oh so much
Why must we play this game'

Don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby

I don't care if we spend the night at your mansion
I don't care if we spend the night on the town

All I want is to spend the night in your arms

To be around you is so right

Darling Nikki

I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby 
Masturbating with a magazine
She said "how'd you like to waste some time'"
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle 
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said "sign your name on the dotted line"
The lights went out 
And Nikki started to grind

Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind

Darlin' Nikki

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found 
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

Oh, Nikki, ohhhh

Come back Nikki, come back
your dirty little Prince
wanna grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

{played backwards}
"Hello, how r u' I'm fine. 'cause I know that the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon."



When Doves Cry

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this'

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and u

Alone in a world that's so cold' So cold
Maybe I'm just to demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father to bold

This is for politicians who r bored and believe in war
This -- Yeah, that's for me, that's who that 1's for
This is for discrimination and egotists who think supreme
And this is for whoever taught you how to kiss in designer jeans
That 1's for-- That 1's for-- for you have to live
This 1's for the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy -- 
The ones that don't know how to give
This 1's for Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland
And this 1-- ooh! Yeah -- That's the 1. 
That's for-- that's for the-- the creator of man
This is for the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland
This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore
This is for-- and that's for you, and that's who that 1's for
This is for the women, so beautifully complex
This 1's for love without sex
This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow
Not knowing where I'm going 
This galaxy's better than not having a place to go
And now I know I know

Said to myself, said
"She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy
Little mixed up dame.

My sister never made love to anyone else but me
She's the reason for my, uh, sexuality

A blow job doesn't mean blow
Incest is everything it's said to be

Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister

I was only 16 and only half a man
My sister didn't give a God damn
She only wanted to turn me out
She took a whip to me until I shout
"Oh, motherfucker she's a brotherfucker
Can't you understand'"

Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again

The Ballad of Dorothy Parker

Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered - "Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't to hungry"
Dorothy laughed
She said "Sounds like a real man to me"
Kinda cute, you wanna take a bath'
do you wanna, do you wanna, bath
I said "Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on" she say
"Cuz I'm kind of going with someone"
She said "Sounds like a real man to me"
"Mind if I turn on the radio'"
"Oh, my favorite song" she said
And it was Joni singing "Help me I think I'm falling"
Ring
The phone rang and she said
"Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you"
Right then I knew I was through
Dorothy Parker was cool
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
Cuz she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh ha ha
I felt much better so I went back 
to the violent room tell us what you did
Let me tell you what I did...

I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker

Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well

Starfish and Coffee

It was 7:for5 we were all in line
to greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us where ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was to0 and every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe u'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different color socks
Sometimes I wondered if the mates where in her lunchbox
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died, you know what we found'

Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, honey
Maybe u'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

Starfish and coffee

Cynthia had a happy face, just like the one she'd draw
On every wall in every school
But it's all right, it's for a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia, keep singin'

Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe u'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told ya so
starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told ya so

If I Was your Girlfriend

"Look at the bargains over here, ladies..."
If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember to tell me all the things you forgot
When I was your man'
Hey, when I was your man
If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you and do all the things
That only a best friend can
Only best friends can

If I was your girlfriend 
If I was your girlfriend

If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me'
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

If I was your girlfriend 
If I was your girlfriend

Would you let me wash your hair
Could I make you breakfast sometime
Or then, could we just hang out, I mean
Could we go to a movie and cry together
Cuz to me baby that would be so fine

If I was your girlfriend
Baby can I dress you
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
If I was your girlfriend
Listen girl, I ain't sayin you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about sugar

Sugar do you know what I'm saying to you this evening' sugar
Maybe you think I'm being 
a little self-centered if I was your girlfriend
But I, I said I want to be sugar
all of the things you are to me sugar
Surely, surely you can see if I was your girlfriend
{{title repeated in background}}
Is it really necessary for me to go out of the room 
just because you wanna undress' 
I mean, we don't have to make children to make love 
And then, we don't have to make love to have an orgasm
your body's what I'm all about 
Can I see you'
I'll show you 
Why not'
you can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it for you
Of course I'll undress in front of you! 
And when I'm naked, what shall I do'
How can I make you see that it's cool'
Can't you just trust me'
If I was your girlfriend you could 
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, for you naked I would dance a ballet 
Would that get you off'
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me' 
Would you let me see you naked then'
Would you let me give you a bath'
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh
And would you, would you let me kiss you there
you know down there where it counts
I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long
And together we'll stare into silence
And we'll try to imagine what it looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try

But I seem to get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to'
Baby I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship' ship, ship, ship

I came and took your love, I took your body
I took all the self respect you ever had
I took you for a ride and baby I'm sorry
The more you love me sugar, the more it makes me mad

Baby I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship' ship, ship, ship

Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie
Then you could rewrite my every line
I'll take all the blame, yo baby I'm sorry
But I didn't like the way you where, so I had to make you mine

Baby I just can't stand to see you happy

I Could Never Take the Place of your Man

It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying 'cause she knew he was gone to stay
It was 10:35 on a lonely friday night
She was standin' by the bar
Hmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah
I asked if she wanted to dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted to know if I thought I was qualified, yeah
And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified for a one night stand
But I could never take the place of your man

It hurt me so bad when she told me 
with tears in her eyes tears in her eyes
He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way
She couldn't stop cryin'
Cause she knew he was gone to stay
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, oh, honey baby that's a dead end
you know and I know that we wouldn't be satisfied

And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
you wouldn't be satisfied with a one night stand
And I could never take the place of your man

Yeah, yeah, the place of your man

If we can just bear the cross

gimme the bass, gimme the bass, one time

Said the table to the chair 
"you can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chillblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!"
Said the table to the chair can't nobody

Said the chair to the table
"Now you know we are not able! fuck with us
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk!" can't nobody
Said the table with a sigh 
"It can do no harm to try fuck with us
I've as many legs as u
Why can't we walk on two'" say, can't nobody

So they both went showly down fuck with us
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound can't nobody
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side fuck with us
"See the table and the chair 
Have come to take the air!" y'all - say it y'all

But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
Till, to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house.

When they whispered to each other
"O delightful little brother! can't nobody fuck with us
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon!"
So the ducky and the little browny- say it, y'all
mousey and the beetle dined,
And danced upon the heads
Till they toddled to their beds. can't nobody fuck with us
Good God [repeated in the background]

Adore

yountil the end of time
I'll be there for you
you own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
your beauty I'd still see
Love is to weak to define
Just what you mean to me

From the first moment I saw you
Ooh, I knew you where the 1
That night I had to call you
I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look
In a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
you made love to me
Like you where afraid
Was you afraid of me'
Was I the first'
Was I your every fantasy'
That's why

yountil the end of time
I'll be there for you
you own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind
your beauty I'd still see
Love is to weak to define
Just what you mean to me

When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix
I know, that you know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial baby
you could say that I'm a terminal case
you could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride, well maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face
All up in the place

I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' baby could compare
to your lovely face
Do you know what I'm sayin' to ya this evening
I'm just tryin' to say
I'm just tryin' to say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
On my heart, on my mind, truly adore you 
I truly adore you darlin'
you don't know what you're mean to me
Baby, until the end of time
Baby, I'll be there for you
Baby, you own my heart and mind
'Til the end of time I'll be there for you
I truly adore you
Adore you adore you

Can I talk to you' {{chorus repeated in background}}
Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander
I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things
That I show no other, I wanna be
More than, more than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be like no like no other
If you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me
Without you there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is to weak to define how much I adore
you, child
you, child
The last words you hear
The last words you hear

until the end of time
I'll be there for u, baby
until the end of time

Be with me darlin' til the end of time until the end of time
I'll give you my heart
I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body until the end of time
I'll give you my time until the end of time
until the end of time

for all time I am with you
you are with me
until the end of time
you are with me, you are with me
